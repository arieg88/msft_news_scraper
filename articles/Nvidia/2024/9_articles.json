        "Text": "Nvidia has been an AI juggernaut for the past couple of years as it challenges for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable corporation. Nvidia\u2019s 156% year-to-date gain and 2,700% gain over the past five years may lead many to suspect there\u2019s limited upside from here, but artificial intelligence is still in its early innings. Understanding the AI opportunity and Nvidia\u2019s unique position in the industry leads me to be bullish on the stock.\nAlthough artificial intelligence has already captivated investors for multiple years, the boom is still going strong,\u00a0and that leads to my optimism for NVDA stock. Corporations are making significant investments in artificial intelligence, and that demand has resulted in a\u00a0projected 19.3% compounded annual growth rate\u00a0from now until 2034.\nArtificial intelligence helps businesses enhance their products and services. For example, CrowdStrike (CRWD) has been investing in\u00a0Charlotte AI\u00a0and other AI features to fortify its cybersecurity software. Adobe (ADBE) has also\u00a0invested in artificial intelligence\u00a0to help individuals and businesses create better images and videos.\nNvidia supplies the AI chips that power these tools. While other semiconductor firms also offer AI chips, Nvidia continues to innovate its chip offerings to stay ahead of the competition. The company is\u00a0working on its new Blackwell chip, which is expected to\u00a0be released\u00a0in 2025.\nRight now, artificial intelligence looks similar to the early days of the internet, in my view. The groundbreaking technology has substantial barriers to entry. Nvidia wins much of the new business, contributing to my bullish outlook for NVDA stock.\nBig tech companies within the Magnificent Seven have been pouring billions of dollars into the technology. Oracle (ORCL) founder Larry Ellison recently said\u00a0that the\u00a0company is\u00a0behind on its AI infrastructure goals. Oracle will likely turn to Nvidia to close that gap, resulting in billions of dollars of additional sales potentially heading Nvidia\u2019s way. Elon Musk\u2019s companies are also in the fray. Tesla and xAI are set to spend\u00a0a\u00a0combined\u00a0$20 billion on AI projects in 2024 alone.\nCorporations aren\u2019t flinching and seem resolved to making additional investments in 2025 and beyond. AI infrastructure is expensive to set up, maintain, and scale. This dynamic benefits Nvidia tremendously as it has established a near monopoly in the industry. According to the IDC, organizations\u00a0are projected\u00a0to\u00a0nearly triple their AI investments\u00a0by the end of 2028. This research suggests a 30% compounded annual growth rate during that stretch.\nNvidia is knocking elbows with the \u2018who\u2019s who\u2019 of big tech and publicly traded corporations.\u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0another reason to feel bullish about the company\u2019s prospects, and\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s partners have\u00a0deep\u00a0wallets.\u00a0The AI chipmaker has partnerships with Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and other titans in the industry.\nMany of these same tech companies have\u00a0been reporting\u00a0record profits. Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers are relatively well-insulated and can continue to pour money into artificial intelligence even during an economic slowdown. The technology\u2019s mainstream appeal is relatively new, and investments are still ramping up. Nvidia\u2019s partnerships make it more likely that the company will continue outgrowing the broader market regardless of whether the economy stalls.\nEven better, key partnerships are likely to expand with age.\u00a0As Nvidia continues\u00a0to deliver\u00a0top-class AI chips to its customers, those clients are\u00a0more likely\u00a0to stick with Nvidia and make\u00a0further large\u00a0investments.\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0has been working with Amazon for more than a decade, while Alphabet recently\u00a0expanded its partnership\u00a0with Nvidia.\nNvidia\u2019s valuation is still reasonably low in considering its revenue and earnings growth rates.\u00a0While a 58x trailing P/E ratio seems high, especially\u00a0when\u00a0compared to other big tech companies, Nvidia has been more than doubling its net income on year-over-year comparisons.\nOn a forward basis, Nvidia stock is priced at a 43.5x P/E ratio, making the valuation look more affordable. Furthermore, the company reported 152% year-over-year net income growth in\u00a0Q2 FY25. High revenue growth paves the way for high net income growth. If Nvidia continues to report a few more quarters of triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth, the forward P/E ratio should continue to drop.\nNvidia stock\u00a0is currently rated\u00a0as a consensus Strong Buy among 42 Wall Street analysts. The average NVDA price target of $152.44 implies about 23% potential upside. The most optimistic price target of $200 reflects 62% upside from current levels. Wall Street analysts carry 39 Buy ratings, three Hold ratings, and no Sell ratings on NVDA stock.\nNvidia is an undisputed leader within the artificial intelligence boom.\u00a0It has established a leading position in supplying the demand for AI capabilities. Nvidia has some of the best customers on the planet, and these corporations are surely to continue investing in AI even during an economic downturn.\nRevenue and net income growth remain superb and, when looking at forward multiples, NVDA stock doesn\u2019t look unreasonably valued. Many Wall Street analysts feel the same\u00a0way, hence the consensus Strong Buy rating.\u00a0Alongside them, I continue to be bullish NVDA.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After a blistering run since early 2023, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has hit a wall. The stock has surged 730% since the start of last year (as of this writing), but over the past three months, Nvidia has tread water, down roughly 4%.\nA number of factors have weighed on the stock. Fears regarding a potential slowdown in the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI), rumors about a delayed release of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell platform, concerns about a decline in the company's gross margin, and a pricey valuation have some investors fearing the stock may have gotten ahead of itself.\nHowever, a quick look at the available evidence suggests that while those concerns are understandable, they are also largely unfounded. I believe there's still plenty of room for Nvidia to run, and I predict the stock will continue to reach new all-time highs into 2025. Here's why.\nThe accelerating adoption of AI has helped fuel the run-up in technology stocks since the start of 2023, but investors have begun to wonder if that breakneck pace could continue. There's evidence that suggests it can.\nTo close out the calendar second quarter, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms all announced plans to increase capital expenditures (capex) for the remainder of 2024, while also laying out plans for significant increases next year. The vast majority of that spending will be allocated to outfitting the servers and data centers needed to support AI. Since these tech titans are Nvidia's biggest customers, this suggests the company's growth streak has legs.\nTaking a step back and looking at the big picture can also provide context. Generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy in the coming years, according to estimates provided by management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. This suggests that the adoption of AI will continue for the foreseeable future.\nReports emerged in early August that Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chips would be delayed by as much as three months due to production issues. The stock skidded on these reports as investors feared the worst.\nWhen Nvidia released its quarterly results in late August, CFO Colette Kress put the matter to rest:\nWe shipped customer samples of our Blackwell architecture in the second quarter. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue.\nThis suggests the reported delays were much ado about nothing.\nWhen Nvidia reported the results of its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), there was much to like. The company generated record quarterly revenue, record quarterly data center revenue, and robust profits. However, there were two issues investors seemed to focus on in Nvidia's otherwise stellar results.\nThe first was the company's gross margin, which declined from a record 78.4% in Q1 to 75.1% in Q2. During the earnings conference call, CFO Colette Kress noted that a combination of product mix and inventory provisions related to the rollout of Blackwell were the culprits.\nThat said, the company is forecasting gross margins for the remainder of the year in the mid-70% range. While that's below the record results in the first quarter, it's still well ahead of Nvidia's 10-year average gross margin of 62%.\nThe other issue that seemed to spook some investors was Nvidia's forecast for its fiscal third quarter, which ends in late October. The company is guiding for record revenue of $32.5 billion, which would represent growth of 79%. That would mark a deceleration from the triple-digit growth Nvidia has delivered in each of the previous five quarters, but it's still a remarkable performance nonetheless.\nSavvy investors knew that the company's growth rate would eventually slow, particularly as Nvidia faces tough comps from last year. That said, the company's revenue growth is still exceptional and should be viewed in that context.\nOne of the biggest issues weighing on Nvidia is the notion that the stock is exorbitantly expensive. That view is certainly understandable, given that the stock is currently selling for 57 times earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings ratio of 30 for the S&P 500. However, investors willing to take a step back will see that Nvidia isn't as expensive as it might appear at first glance.\nA quick look at the stock chart reveals that Nvidia is actually trading slightly lower than its average P/E ratio over the past decade. It's also worth noting that during the past 10 years, Nvidia stock has gained more than 25,000%, evidence that the stock has been -- and continues to be -- deserving of a premium.\nHowever, a look ahead suggests the stock is even cheaper. Wall Street is forecasting earnings per share of $4.02 for the coming fiscal year, which kicks off in late January. That means Nvidia is currently trading for less than 29 times forward earnings (as of this writing), which is a bargain, particularly given the company's continuing growth prospects.\nGiven the run-up of Nvidia stock since early last year, it's understandable that investors are taking a step back to survey the landscape. Yet it's clear the factors that have been weighing on the stock are much ado about nothing.\nNvidia's largest customers continue to spend heavily on its products, its next-generation platform is on track, its gross margin remains near a record high, and its valuation isn't nearly as pricey as it appears at first glance.\nThis all suggests a clear runway ahead for Nvidia, and I predict that the stock will continue to reach new heights well into 2025.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "It doesn't take an investing genius to know that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a huge winner from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The surging demand for graphics pressing units (GPUs) -- driven largely by AI -- has made Nvidia one of the largest companies on the planet.\nCan Nvidia grow even bigger? Yep. The chip giant sees a $1 trillion opportunity ahead -- and it's not AI.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in his company's second-quarter earnings call in August, \"[T]he world is moving from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion worth of data centers. $1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing.\" He added later in the call, \"We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize $1 trillion worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing.\"\nIs further AI demand needed to facilitate this transition to accelerated computing? Huang doesn't think so.\nHe spoke on Sept. 11, 2024, at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference. In his remarks, Huang imagined a scenario where AI didn't exist. He said, \"Well, in the world where there's no AI at all, general-purpose computing has run out of steam still.\"\nHuang argued that \"Moore's Law is over\" -- a reference to the principle espoused by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the speed of computers will double every two years. He maintained that the physical limits of fabricating semiconductors will get in the way.\nThe solution to the problem in Huang's view, is accelerated computing. And no company beats Nvidia at designing the GPUs required to make accelerated computing possible.\nOf course, we don't live in a hypothetical world where AI doesn't exist. In the real world, AI is accelerating the shift to accelerated computing. Nvidia continues to add fuel to this fire.\nThe company's new Blackwell GPU architecture will enable building and running large language models (LLMs) with 1 trillion parameters at up to 25 times lower cost and energy consumption than the current gold standard Hopper platform. Unsurprisingly, Huang said in Nvidia's Q2 earnings call that \"the demand for Blackwell is incredible.\"\nBut AI won't just speed up the transition of existing data centers that use general-purpose computing to new ones that use accelerated computing; it will also likely continue to drive the construction of more data centers. These new data centers will be what Nvidia calls \"AI factories\" with data and electricity as raw materials and AI as the product.\nLook for Nvidia to continue pouring fuel on the fire. The company is now in a \"one-year rhythm\" of introducing new GPU technology. As Huang said earlier this year, [A]fter Blackwell... we have other Blackwells coming.\"\nDoes Nvidia's $1 trillion opportunity make the stock a no-brainer buy? Maybe, although it's not a slam dunk.\nFor one thing, it could take much longer than Huang envisions for existing data centers to transition to accelerated computing. The surge in AI-related demand could taper off. Nvidia might not capture as much of the data center market as it hopes.\nInvestors should also recognize that significant growth prospects are already baked into Nvidia's share price. The stock trades at 29.3 times trailing 12-month sales and 40 times forward earnings.\nBut the general premise of Huang's case for Nvidia's $1 trillion opportunity seems reasonable. Whether or not you think Nvidia stock is a no-brainer buy, it should still deliver exceptional gains for long-term investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the planet in recent times. The shares have soared 2,500% over the past 5 years -- and just this year they've climbed more than 130%. This is thanks to the company's dominance in the high-growth artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Nvidia's sales of chips and other AI products and services have helped earnings climb into the billions of dollars.\nAnd this momentum may be in its early days considering forecasts for AI growth. The AI market is expected to expand from about $200 billion today to $1 trillion by the end of the decade. As a major player in the space, Nvidia could continue to generate explosive earnings gains. That said, some investors have worried about increasing competition in the market and how that could impact Nvidia's pricing power.\nBefore you decide to buy or sell this high-profile stock, here are 10 things you need to know.\nNvidia's next big release is the Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever -- a platform that could be a game changer for the company and its customers. The company recently said the launch is on track, quelling rumors about delays. (Nvidia just implemented one change to improve production yields.) The Blackwell production ramp is set to start in the fourth quarter, and the company even predicts \"several billion dollars\" of Blackwell revenue in that period.\nBlackwell is coming, but earlier architecture Hopper isn't going away. Though Blackwell is more powerful, Hopper remains state of the art, and customers, eager to advance their AI projects, are flocking to it. Nvidia's expectation of 80% year-over-year revenue growth in the upcoming quarter is thanks to demand for Hopper, meaning this platform continues to be a key revenue driver for the company.\nEnterprise software will be a significant growth driver, the company has said in the past, and now Nvidia's efforts in this area are bearing fruit. Nvidia AI Enterprise, an \"operating system\" for companies' AI projects, streamlines the development of generative AI applications. And Nvidia expects its software to finish the year with a $2 billion annual-revenue run rate, \"notably contributing to growth,\" the company says.\nSince the U.S. imposed a ban on chip exports to China, Nvidia has seen its revenue from that country drop. The company has developed other chips specifically for China that meet U.S. export requirements, and in the latest earnings report, Nvidia said China was a \"significant contributor\" to data-center revenue. Still, China is bringing in much less revenue than before the export controls, and the company expects the market to remain highly competitive.\nNvidia has said that \"other Blackwells\" are down the road following the upcoming Blackwell launch, meaning this top-tech company will keep on innovating. Nvidia has pledged to update its graphics processing units (GPUs) on an annual basis. This plan makes me confident about the company maintaining its leadership, and the new releases offer catalysts for stock performance.\nThe data-center business may have become Nvidia's biggest, taking the reins from gaming, but this doesn't mean gaming's growth is over. The segment is still a key contributor, and in the most recent quarter, it posted a 16% increase to more than $2.8 billion. Today, the GeForce NOW library boasts a catalog of more than 2,000 titles for the biggest collection of any cloud-gaming provider.\nYes, Nvidia faces competition from others, such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. But I don't expect this to hurt Nvidia -- for two reasons. First, market demand is so high that there is room for several participants. And second, Nvidia's focus on innovation, as mentioned above, and the fact that it already is the market leader mean it likely will continue to stay ahead when it comes to chip technology -- and that will make it hard to unseat the company.\nNvidia's stellar track record when it comes to return on invested capital and free cash flow is a big positive. This shows it's investing wisely, and therefore benefiting from its investments over time, and is highly profitable. As we can see in the chart, below, even prior to the AI boom, Nvidia progressively grew these metrics, showing wise management across the business.\nNVDA Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts.\nNvidia recently completed a 10-for-1 stock split, a move to lower the per-share price after its enormous gain so that a broader range of investors can get in on the stock. The company's board also approved a $50 billion share-repurchase authorization, adding to the remaining $7.5 billion already authorized. These two moves show confidence that the shares still have plenty of room to run.\nNvidia isn't the cheapest stock around. But considering the positive points I mention here (and the fact that they outweigh the negative), the stock looks pretty reasonable today at 40 times forward-earnings estimates. And this is down from 50 times earlier this year. All of this means Nvidia, even after its enormous gains, still looks like a solid AI winner to buy and hold.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "When you think about artificial intelligence (AI), things such as self-driving cars and humanoid robots might come to mind. Counterintuitively, it's often a good idea to think about how products are actually brought to life whenever a new big trend emerges. Some of the most lucrative opportunities are also often the least obvious ones.\nFor AI to even work properly, companies have to invest large sums of capital expenditures (capex)\u00a0into data centers. Although data centers might seem like just a piece of real estate, they are far more sophisticated and important. They house critical IT infrastructure, such as chipsets known as graphics processing units (GPUs)\u00a0-- an important component of generative AI applications.\nToday, Nvidia is one of the biggest names in the data center realm. But what if I told you I see another opportunity as the superior choice among data center investments and that it's not even a technology company?\nIt's important to consider all options -- even the most tangential ones. Let's dig into a nuclear energy stock that I think may end up being the most important data center company in the long run and explore why this could be a lucrative opportunity for investors.\nA major selling point of AI is that the technology can bring a new wave of efficiency to a host of use cases. From breakthroughs in enterprise software to self-driving cars, AI is promising a new level of productivity and safety that's never been witnessed.\nAlthough that sounds great, as with all things, AI comes with some major trade-offs. Namely, building AI applications is a pricey ambition. GPU hardware and high-performance computing software are some of the more obvious expenses in AI development. One of the more subtle costs in an AI roadmap resides with data centers, particularly their energy consumption.\nGPUs are constantly running complex algorithms and performing sophisticated computing tasks. This makes IT architecture, such as server racks, consume a lot of energy and, in particular, give off a lot of heat. Data centers are equipped with a number of temperature control protocols, such as air conditioning units, fans, and generators.\nHowever, these solutions are both costly and can be inefficient compared to other sources of energy control.\u00a0An emerging trend at the crossroads of data centers and energy consumption is nuclear power, and some really notable companies and business leaders are getting involved.\nOne notable company involved with nuclear-powered data centers is Amazon. One of the biggest businesses in Amazon's ecosystem is its cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Earlier this year, AWS acquired a nuclear-powered data center from Talen Energy for a reported $650 million.\nAnother player emerging on the nuclear power scene is\u00a0Oklo. Oklo develops nuclear fission reactors that it aims to sell to data centers and utility companies.\nWhen it was still a private company, Oklo raised funding from Peter Thiel and OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman. A few months ago, Oklo went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).\nAccording to its investor presentation, the company has received interest for its reactors from major companies, including Diamondback Energy, Equinix, Siemens Energy, and even the U.S. Air Force.\nWhile this caliber of attention and Altman's support are impressive, I see Oklo as a risky bet at the moment. The company is still pre-revenue, and the potential deals referenced above are in early-stage negotiations.\nOklo will likely require hefty ongoing research and development (R&D) costs to build out its reactors, which will take a toll on the company's liquidity so long as there aren't material sales coming through the door.\nMy top choice among nuclear power suppliers for data centers is Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG). The company offers a host of energy services but is making sustainability and nuclear energy a specific focus.\nOne of the company's known nuclear power customers is \"Magnificent Seven\" member Microsoft. During the company's second-quarter earnings call in late August, CEO Joseph Dominguez referenced Comcast and Johns Hopkins as other notable customers of Constellation's carbon-free energy services.\nOther mega-cap tech companies will likely follow Amazon and Microsoft's moves. Constellation's diverse customer base signals that green energy is not just a use case for data centers or big tech hyperscalers.\nInvestors with a long-term horizon may want to consider a position in Constellation Energy right now. I think nuclear energy solutions will become more mainstream as the AI revolution continues to evolve. Given how early the AI narrative seems to be, I think an opportunity such as Constellation Energy is largely overlooked or underappreciated -- making it a tempting buy among other opportunities in AI, data centers, and energy consumption.\nBefore you buy stock in Constellation Energy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Constellation Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks To Invest In According to Billionaires.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other billionaire-approved stocks.\nBillionaires and top hedge fund managers typically dominate the stock market, focusing on leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. They usually don\u2019t waste time with underperformers\u2014they target the market's elite.\nBefore diving into the top stock picks among billionaires, reviewing how the market has performed so far this year is essential. On September 18, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, lowering it to 4.75%\u20135.00% from 5.25%\u20135.50%. This move fueled a market rally, pushing stocks to a new intraday record high, and marking the 39th all-time high of 2024\u2014the first since mid-July. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari acknowledged that while the rate cut was unusual historically, shifting the policy focus from controlling high inflation to addressing a weakening labor market was necessary. Here are some comments:\n\u201cRight now, we still have a strong, healthy labor market. But I want to keep it a strong, healthy labor market, and a lot of the recent inflation data is coming in looking very positive that we\u2019re on our way back to 2%. So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to find anybody at the Federal Reserve who declares mission accomplished, but we are paying attention to what risks are most likely to materialize in the near future.\u201d\nMarket expectations point to an equal probability of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cutting rates by either a quarter- or half-percentage point at its November meeting, with a higher chance of the larger reduction in December. Overall, markets are signaling the Fed\u2019s intent to bring rates to a \"neutral\" level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth.\nFor nearly two years, bulls have dominated Wall Street, driven by a resilient U.S. economy and growing enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI). This momentum has propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to multiple record highs in 2024. Despite the surge, not everyone seems hopeful about the market, with some of the most influential billionaire investors, including Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, signaling caution. Buffett, known for his long-term optimism, has been a net seller of stocks for seven straight quarters.\nOn the other hand, billionaire investor Ray Dalio recently raised concerns about the \"enormous amount of debt\" burdening the U.S. economy. He cautions that neither former President Donald Trump nor Vice President Kamala Harris is likely to focus on addressing debt sustainability in the upcoming presidential election, suggesting that the pressure from the $35.3 trillion national debt will persist, regardless of the election outcome.\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we analyzed Insider Monkey's exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world\u2019s leading hedge funds and companies.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The company provides advanced graphics computing and networking solutions, and strong demand for its GPUs, particularly in gaming and AI models, has driven NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to a trillion-dollar valuation.\nNVIDIA's impressive rally continues to heavily influence the S&P 500, raising concerns that a downturn in the chipmaker's fortunes could impact broader market performance. The stock's 140% increase in 2024 alone has contributed to about a quarter of the S&P 500's 17% gain this year.\nAt NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at $250 billion, which could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion over the next decade if investment trends persist.\nAccording to Insider Monkey, 29 billionaires held stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0at the end of Q2 2024, with notable investors including Rajiv Jain, Ken Fisher, Israel Englander, and Ken Griffin.\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the stocks to invest in according to billionaires.

        "Text": "Over the last two years, the hype around the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has led to incredible operating momentum for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the company that designs and manufactures most of the industry's chips. But while business is roaring, the company's stock price seems to have hit a roadblock. Let's discuss why this might be happening and determine whether Nvidia's shares can hit $200 before the end of the year.\nWith shares up by around 2,450% over the last five years, Nvidia has been a rewarding investment for its long-to-medium-term shareholders. However, the thesis is beginning to unravel, as strong operational results are no longer impressing the market as much as before.\nSecond-quarter revenue soared 122% year over year to $30 billion, driven by massive demand for Nvidia's data center graphics processing units (GPUs), which help run and train AI algorithms. The company's bottom line also remains buoyant, with operating income jumping 174% year over year to $18.6 million. Management expects the release of new AI hardware products based on the faster and more efficient Blackwell architecture to stimulate client demand in 2025 and beyond.\nNvidia's board also approved a whopping $50 billion worth of share repurchases in the quarter, which can boost investors' claim on future earnings by lowering the number of shares outstanding.\nHowever, while these are objectively good results, Nvidia's split-adjusted stock price has fallen around 10% since the release on Aug. 28, suggesting many market participants think the operational momentum is unsustainable.\nThere are several reasons why investors might take Nvidia's current results with a grain of salt. For starters, the consumer-facing software side of the generative AI industry is yet to prove its monetization potential. For instance, analysts at Goldman Sachs worry that today's AI systems simply aren't designed to solve problems complex enough to justify their costs.\nAnd while the technology behind large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT continues to improve, that doesn't necessarily mean they will become easier to monetize because of competition from free, open-source rivals like Meta Platforms' Llama or Elon Musk's Grok.\nThere is a growing risk that AI could follow the pattern of previous hype cycles like the internet or electric vehicles, where corporations overbuilt capacity in anticipation of consumer demand that didn't materialize quickly. If this happens with generative AI, the market for Nvidia's pricey data center hardware could plateau or decline in the near term -- even if the technology becomes widely adopted over the coming decades. \nAfter a 10-for-1 stock split in June, Nvidia's modest $115 stock price belies its true size. With a market cap of $2.84 trillion, the GPU chipmaker is already the third-largest company in the world -- behind Microsoft and Apple, which are worth $3.23 trillion and $3.3 trillion, respectively.\nA 73% rally to $200 should take Nvidia's market cap to roughly $4.9 billion, most likely putting it in the No. 1 spot. And with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 41, the stock certainly looks like it has more room to run, considering its triple-digit earnings growth.\nThat said, unlike the typical megacap company, which usually built its business over decades by servicing established, profitable sectors in the economy, Nvidia's business remains speculative and uncertain -- earning it a discounted valuation. The company looks unlikely to hit a share price of $200 in 2024 or any time soon until the software side of the AI industry starts to carry its own weight. And that is far from guaranteed.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The capital raise valued the Google (GOOG) and Yahoo rival at close to $1 billion.\nSocher said he met with Huang for nearly two hours around the time of the investment, discussing topics ranging from history to running a business.\n\u201cI don\u2019t generally get nervous with most people, but it was very impressive to hear him giving advice,\" Socher said.\nDuring his conversation, Socher said Huang shared that \u201che focused a lot on the speed of Nvidia\" during its early years.\nEventually, Nvidia opted to pivot a little to gain focus.\n\u201cAt some point, they realized that the best way is to focus on gaming first and really dominate that niche,\u201d Socher said, adding that Huang suggested staying focused on You.com's mission of being an artificial intelligence-powered alternative to Google.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Socher and Nvidia have crossed paths.\nIn the early 2010s, his research group at Stanford utilized Nvidia GPUs. At that time, Nvidia mostly sold GPU products to the graphics sector. \u201cNvidia was like, 'Who are you? Why are you trying to buy our GPUs?'\u201d said Socher, noting that GPUs now assist with the company's AI workloads.\n \nNvidia launched in 1993 \u2014 born from Huang's scribbling on a napkin at a Denny's \u2014 to develop 3D graphics for gaming and multimedia purposes. Back then, an increasing number of consumers were taking the computing plunge, leading to demand for higher-powered computers.\nSix years later, Nvidia introduced graphics processing units (GPU), and in 2012, it brought AI to the forefront by introducing the AlexNet neural network.\nThis summer, Nvidia introduced an initiative that would bring generative AI to a wider audience using its latest GPU technology. The company's AI chips are seen as having a wide performance lead over rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), leading to impressive financial results over the past two years.\nNvidia's second quarter sales and earnings rose 122% and 152%, respectively, from the prior year.\nAfter a summer pullback following mixed third quarter guidance, Nvidia is now the third most valuable company in the world. It sports a market cap of $2.98 trillion, while Microsoft sits at $3.18 trillion and Apple stands at $3.46 trillion, according to Yahoo Finance's comparison tool.\nYear to date, shares are up 145% compared to an 18% gain for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite.\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "Title": "Nvidia is suddenly in trouble",
        "Author": "  Analysis by David Goldman, CNN ",
        "Text": "Nvidia, the AI chipmaking titan that was briefly the world\u2019s most valuable company, has suddenly found itself in an unfamiliar position: a major rut.\nNvidia (NVDA) had the worst day in the history of the stock market Tuesday, as measured by loss in total market value. Its 9.5% share price decline shaved a stunning $279 billion off the company\u2019s value, far outpacing the previous record of $240 billion set by Meta in 2022.\nTo put that shocking decline into context, only 27 companies on the planet are worth as much as Nvidia lost in value Tuesday. That $279 billion evaporation is worth more than all the shares of some of America\u2019s biggest companies, including McDonald\u2019s, Chevron and Pepsi.\nCEO Jensen Huang, who is Nvidia\u2019s largest individual shareholder (and fifth-largest overall, counting institutional investors like BlackRock) personally lost $10 billion in wealth Tuesday from Nvidia\u2019s sharp tumble.\nThe company has been in decline since June 18, when it topped $3.3 trillion in value \u2014 the highest for any public company. As the US economy begins to show some signs of stress, investors have grown skeptical of Nvidia and other AI stocks\u2019 sky-high valuations. Stock traders are worried that potential weakness in the economy could make companies think twice before investing in the promising but still risky and unproven technology.\nDespite blockbuster earnings last week, Nvidia\u2019s somewhat more tepid outlook disappointed investors who were looking for more upside, and the stock fell.\nNvidia has tumbled more than 20% since its June 18 peak. Microsoft, which has made huge bets on AI technology, has fallen 12% from its most recent peak. And TSMC, Nvidia\u2019s chip manufacturer, has plunged 18% since mid-July.\nMeanwhile, Intel, once the world biggest chipmaker, has endured a 59% decline in its share price this year. That company faces its own unique challenges in its bid to remake itself and get into the AI game.\nBut Nvidia may face a different set of problems: The government is reportedly investigating it over potential antitrust violations.\nMuch of Tuesday\u2019s sharp decline was because the US Justice Department reportedly sent it a subpoena as part of an antitrust probe, according to Bloomberg. CNN could not independently verify the subpoena, and the Department of Justice declined to comment directly on a potential antitrust investigation.\nNvidia on Wednesday afternoon said it has not received a subpoena from the Justice Department.\n\u201cWe have inquired with the US Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed,\u201d an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cNonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.\u201d\nThe Biden administration has been going hard after tech titans, launching probes and lobbing charges against Apple, Google and Amazon, among others. It\u2019s unclear whether a Kamala Harris or Donald Trump administration would continue those cases, but both have criticized tech companies for various reasons during their campaigns.\nNvidia lost another 1.7% Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite, which tanked more than 3% Tuesday, fell 0.3% Wednesday.\nStill, AI bulls continue to believe in Nvidia. The stock remains up 118% this year and has a $2.7 trillion market valuation \u2014 a close third behind Apple and Microsoft. Huang said last week that demand for its latest \u201cBlackwell\u201d AI chips \u201cfar exceeds its supply.\u201d And even as competition grows, demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips is growing, too.\nAnd the investments are paying off \u2014 so far, at least \u2014 Huang claims.\n\u201cPeople who are investing in Nvidia infrastructure are getting returns on it right away,\u201d Huang said last week, noting that the company\u2019s new graphics processing units, the GPU chips that power AI, process data so efficiently that they end up saving clients money quickly.\nThat\u2019s why bulls like Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives believe Nvidia\u2019s stock decline presents a buying opportunity.\n\u201cNvidia has changed the tech and global landscape as its GPUs have become the new oil and gold in the IT landscape,\u201d Ives said Tuesday in a note to investors.\n\u2013 CNN\u2019s Ramishah Maruf contributed to this report\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Author": "  Rob Wile ",
        "Text": "It\u2019s been described as the most important company in the world at the moment.\nBut new concerns surrounding Nvidia, the chipmaker powering the artificial intelligence revolution \u2014 and which this summer became America\u2019s second-largest public company, behind Apple, when its valuation surpassed $3 trillion \u2014 have prompted a fresh global market sell-off.\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia shares dropped 9.5%, erasing $278.9 billion from the company\u2019s value \u2014 the biggest such single-day loss ever for a U.S. stock.\nA host of factors appear to have helped drive the sell-off, which also sparked losses in broader market indexes like the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average.\nNvidia\u2019s stock has become a bellwether for the global economy as a whole, as it has helped drive a boom in investment from large tech companies that have looked to AI to drive new innovation \u2014 and profit.\nOn Wednesday, its share price declined another 1.7%. Its overall market capitalization \u2014 the value of the company based on its shares \u2014 remains around $2.6 trillion.\n\u201cThe surge in NVIDIA\u2019s earnings comes from the massive investment in AI being done by the other big tech companies,\u201d Dario Perkins, managing director at TS Lombard financial group, wrote in a commentary this week.\n\u201cThis creates a circular dynamic that leaves NVIDIA (and now the US stock market in general) dependent on continued big AI investments.\u201d If the five-largest publicly traded companies, like Amazon and Microsoft, stop investing in Nvidia, Perkins said, \u201cwe could have a problem.\u201d\nNvidia was once known for making graphics cards for computer games. But in a somewhat fortuitous twist, these cards happen to be perfect for handling the computing load AI requires to perform its tasks.\nAs a result, Microsoft and Facebook-parent Meta both now spend more than 40% of their budgets for hardware on Nvidia gear.\nNvidia is now so closely followed that a group of market watchers held a meetup at a bar last month to watch the company report its quarterly earnings \u2014 though some later viewed the event itself as a sell signal.\n\u201cNvidia has changed the tech and global landscape as its [graphics processing units] have become the new oil and gold in the IT landscape, with its chips powering the AI revolution and being the only game in town for now,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a recent note.\nBut growing fears of a broader economic slowdown, as well as renewed skepticism about the timetable for a payoff from AI \u2014 basically, how soon all the current investment flowing into it will ultimately lead to well-defined use cases and greater profitability \u2014 have helped drag Nvidia\u2019s stock price down.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think AI will measure up to the internet in my opinion,\u201d Daron Acemoglu, an economist with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an interview with the Financial Times this week, calling the technology \u201ca few-trick pony.\u201d\n\u201cAI has some great capabilities, but it does not have the same breadth of impacting pretty much everything we do and creating lots of new things yet,\u201d Acemoglu said. \u201cIt might, but when it does, perhaps we\u2019ll call that a new technology, perhaps that will be another 10 years, and so on.\u201d\nThe skepticism has coincided with fresh economic warning signals. In the U.S., the labor market has begun to show unmistakable signs of weakness following the jobs boom that accompanied a broader economic recovery from the Covid pandemic. In China, problems in the housing sector have begun to weigh on consumption. Oil prices, which tend to track global economic activity, have fallen to their lowest levels in three years.\nMeanwhile, a pair of new reports this week cast fresh doubt about when AI investments will pay off.\n\u201cInvestors are debating whether future revenues for top tech and cloud computing firms could justify billions of dollars of capital spending being poured into artificial intelligence (AI),\u201d analysts with BlackRock Investment Institute wrote.\nA similar note of caution was sounded in commentary from JP Morgan Asset management, which said that companies would have to start to meaningfully shift emphasis from \u201ctraining\u201d to \u201cproduction\u201d for \u201cadequate returns on AI infrastructure to materialize.\u201d\nComplicating matters further was a report Tuesday from Bloomberg News that the Justice Department had begun looking into antitrust issues surrounding Nvidia, which is estimated to maintain at least 90% market share in AI chips for the next two years.\nAnother factor: Intel, once the dominant force in U.S. computer chips, has seen its share price decline 54% this year and, according to a Reuters report, is now in danger of being delisted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. While investors have punished Intel for failing to adequately take advantage of the AI boom, it is likely that broader concerns about its payoff added to its losses.\nSteve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers financial group, told NBC News in an email that, even as it has powered higher, Nvidia remains one of the most volatile stocks on the market, meaning its price is subject to large changes, both higher and lower.\n\u201cSo investors who believe in the company had better get used to the swings,\u201d Sosnick wrote. \u201cInvestors love volatility on the way up (aka 'socially acceptable volatility') but hate it on the way down. Unfortunately, one usually brings the other.\u201d\nTuesday\u2019s sell-off is far from a death-blow for Nvidia\u2019s stock price, which has more than doubled in 2024, to about $109. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index, too, remains 16% higher on the year, and since 2023 has climbed by nearly two-thirds.\nSosnick says much of the selling of Nvidia\u2019s stock, which trades as NVDA, may ultimately have to do with investment managers making sure they cement the outsized price increase the company\u2019s shares have already seen this year.\n\u201cI believe that while individual investors remain understandably enamored with NVDA \u2014 heck, many of them made a lot of money \u2014 I believe that institutional investors are taking a more sober view, focusing on locking in gains in the back half of the year, and that is pressuring the stock,\u201d Sosnick said. \u201cThey understand that no one ever went broke taking a profit.\u201d\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com\n"

        "Title": "Should Investors Load Up on Nvidia Before Its Blackwell Chip Launches?",
        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) H100 chips became the go-to building block for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers powering models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Technology's most prominent companies have bought hundreds of thousands of H100 chips, giving Nvidia the lion's share of the AI chip market.\nThe H100's success fueled rampant growth and propelled the stock to a multitrillion-dollar valuation. Now, Nvidia is about to launch its Blackwell platform, its next-generation architecture that it expects will take AI technology to the next level.\nShould you buy Nvidia stock before Blackwell arrives in the coming weeks? Here is what you need to know.\nAI completely changed Nvidia's trajectory, and it happened seemingly overnight. Revenue and the share price grew so fast that some investors might question whether this is sustainable or just a flash in the pan. Stated plainly, Nvidia must maintain strong chip demand and pricing power. If it does, the stock is arguably a bargain today.\nSales momentum still looks healthy. The company's data center segment grew sales 154% year over year in the second quarter of its fiscal 2025, a 16% increase over the first quarter. Management guided for $32.5 billion in third-quarter revenue, representing nearly 80% year-over-year growth and an 8% increase from the second quarter.\nGrowth is slowing, but it was bound to since the blistering rate last year creates increasingly challenging comparables to beat. But management said in its second-quarter earnings call that H100 demand is still growing. It also maintained that its gross margins will finish the fiscal year in the mid-70% range. Overwhelming AI demand has given Nivida pricing power that has boosted margins well beyond past levels:\nThe margin guidance implies that Nvidia still enjoys pricing leverage. Declining margins would be a red flag since that would indicate potential problems like slowing demand or competitive pressure. That would also slow earnings growth, a problem for anyone who buys the stock today with the expectations of strong growth in the future.\nShares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 41 times fiscal 2025 earnings and 29 times the following year's estimates, roughly six quarters out. Analysts believe the company will increase earnings by an average of 36% annually for the next three to five years, giving it a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of just over 1.1. It's a solid argument that Nvidia remains a table-pounding buy, assuming growth stays on track.\nWhether the company can meet these high expectations over the next several years will depend on its upcoming Blackwell chip architecture, the successor to the H100. So far, it seems that the new chip is poised to deliver. Management said during the second-quarter call that Blackwell will enter production in the fourth quarter, soon enough to generate revenue before the fiscal year ends.\nWhat's important is that there is more demand than available supply. This, of course, bodes well for continued sales performance and supports the pricing leverage needed to maintain profit margins. The company gets an estimated 40% of its revenue from Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon. Thus far, these power spenders haven't indicated plans to withdraw from the AI arms race. Nvidia's management expects Blackwell demand to outpace supply into the next fiscal year.\nThe underlying trend supporting all this growth is that more-advanced AI requires more code and data to build and train. As these models grow, they need increasing computing power to run them. Nvidia estimates that next-generation models will require 10 to 20 times more computing capacity. If so, old hardware could quickly fall behind.\nIt's fair to question the billions of dollars large tech companies spend on AI, but so much is at stake. For cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft, integrating AI is part of protecting and growing their cloud businesses. Alphabet's CEO has stated that the risk of underinvesting in AI and falling behind competitors outweighs the risk of overspending.\nPlus, the competition has struggled to break Nvidia's stranglehold on the AI chip market. Intel set out to reestablish itself in the chip industry but has struggled to the point that acquisition rumors are swirling. Right now, the path forward looks clear. Nvidia seems poised to deliver on admittedly high expectations over the next 18 months, which justifies buying the stock as Blackwell is prepared for launch.\nHowever, a word of caution: It's unclear whether the company can indefinitely sell this many chips at such high margins. It depends on these power spenders, and big tech companies could eventually tire of shelling out the cash to buy all these chips and instead seek alternatives. You should approach Nvidia as a higher-risk stock even if the fundamentals say it's a strong buy today.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

These will largely include the Hopper and Blackwell models, with CoWoS-S reaching a yield of over 99%.\nIn addition, CoWoS-L, another Nvidia process, is expected to produce between 3.8 and 4 million units, with a focus on supporting the high-demand GB200 server racks, allocating 80-90% of the output to this product line.\nMizuho\u2019s revised forecast comes as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Nvidia\u2019s key production partner, is doubling its annual wafer capacity.\n\u201cWe expect the tightness in CoWoS supply to continue into 2025 but project gradual improvement with an estimated annual wafer capacity of above 650,000 coming on line at TSMC next year (up 2x YoY),\u201d the note states.\n\u201cIn addition to increasing front-end (chip-on-wafer) capacity, some back-end (on-substrate) processes are expected to be outsourced to Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE), and the supply-demand situation is expected to gradually improve.\u201d\nAnalysts think that investors' concerns about potential delays in the Blackwell GPU rollout have been \u201cexaggerated,\u201d pointing out that both TSMC and SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) are on track for sales growth following the launch of the Blackwell GPU in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nOverall, Mizuho\u2019s Asia hardware and semis analysts do not expect delays on the semiconductor side, including AI GPUs and ASICs, to impact AI server production in 2025. They also noted that Taiwanese back-end equipment vendors, such as Allring Tech, are likely to benefit from TSMC's vendor localization efforts.\nRelated Articles\nNVIDIA 2025 GPU unit forecast raised at Mizuho\nLebanese arrive in Turkey shaken by war, hope for quick return\nWall St mixed ahead of data-loaded week; Powell's comments awaited\n"

        "Text": "Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, NVIDIA's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n45% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders\n Insiders have sold recently \nEvery investor in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 66% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NVIDIA.\n View our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\nNVIDIA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NVIDIA. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.5% and 4.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. In addition, we found that Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO has 3.5% of the shares allocated to their name.\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in NVIDIA Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$117b. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. \nWith a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NVIDIA. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NVIDIA better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for NVIDIA (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "Title": "Post-Fed Rate Cut: Buy, Hold, or Sell NVIDIA Stock?",
        "Author": "  Tirthankar Chakraborty ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has crushed bubble fears and has seen a meteoric rise in the past few years amid the advent of artificial intelligence (AI).\nCEO Jensen Huang, however, believes NVIDIA\u2019s growth story is just beginning, while the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent jumbo interest rate cuts should help the company access cheaper capital. So, is this the most opportune moment to place bets on the stock? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nIn Wednesday\u2019s concluded policy meeting, the Fed trimmed interest rates by half a point to support economic growth and stabilize the labor market. For the first time in four years, the Fed eased its monetary policy and kept the interest rates at 4.75% to 5%.\nThe Summary of Economic Projections further showed that most Fed officials expect another 50-basis point rate cut by the end of the year, followed by 100 and 50-basis point rate cuts in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\nA lower interest rate environment bodes well for NVIDIA since the semiconductor behemoth\u2019s cash flows essential for growth initiatives aren\u2019t affected. At the same time the company\u2019s cost of borrowings gets reduced, eventually boosting the profit margins vis-\u00e0-vis the share price (read more: NVIDIA & 2 Other AI Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates).\nNVIDIA stock has always performed well after interest rate cut announcements. As a result, the company\u2019s share price increased nearly 4% on Thursday.\nAccording to Dow Jones Market Data, the NVIDIA stock gained, on average, 6.9%, 16.6%, 16.7%, and 20.7% in the month, three months, six months and 12 months following a rate cut.\nOn the other hand, going back to the 1990s, the S&P 500 Index, on average, gained only 2.9% in the 12 months after a rate cut, indicating NVIDIA stock has more upside than most of the listed stocks in the broader index.\nIt\u2019s not just the long-awaited big Fed rate cut that pushed the NVIDIA stock higher yesterday. CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s encouraging comments on the AI movement at the Dreamforce technological gathering hosted by Salesforce, Inc. CRM also had investors pouring into NVDA stock.\nHuang said the AI industry is transforming from tools to an industry of skills, and there is a huge opportunity in the field of AI that NVIDIA can exploit. This has given investors all the more reason to believe that NVIDIA\u2019s stunning growth isn\u2019t over yet. Even though NVIDIA stock has fallen off its record highs, its shares have outpaced the Semiconductor - General industry this year (+138.1% vs +89%).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA\u2019s advanced chips are needed to train large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini and function AI interfaces. NVIDIA stock, thus, is expected to gain as the AI industry is projected to grow from around $184 billion this year to $826 billion by 2030, according to Statista.\nMoreover, AI is here to stay as its foundation is based on practical applications, unlike the dot com era when companies were involved in speculative businesses (read more: What AI Bubble? NVIDIA & 2 Other Chip Stocks With Strong Price Upside).\nEncouraging developments on Blackwell chip production, dominance in the graphic processing units (GPU) market and capability to generate profits consistently also act as tailwinds for the NVIDIA stock.\nHuang confirmed that NVIDIA has ramped up the production of cutting-edge Blackwell chips as demand has soared among the likes of Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, and Microsoft Corporation MSFT. After all, the Blackwell B200 chip has more AI throughput than the current Hopper H100 chip.\nMeanwhile, NVIDIA accounts for the bulk of the share in the GPU market as more developers depend on the CUDA software platform, unlike Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u2019s (AMD) not-so-efficient ROCm software platform. NVIDIA, thus, is well-poised to make the most of the rise in the GPU market, which is likely to expand to $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion this year, per Precedence Research.\nFundamentally, the NVIDIA stock is sound. This is because its return on equity (ROE) is around 120% compared with the industry\u2019s 73.2%. An ROE above 100% indicates that the company\u2019s net income is more than the equity or that it has given a strong performance.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGiven the positives, things are looking brighter for the NVIDIA stock. Prominent brokers have increased NVDA\u2019s average short-term price target by 31.3% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $113.37. The highest price target is $200, an upside of 76.4%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, the NVDA stock is still pricey. Per the price/earnings, the NVDA stock, presently, trades at 42.0X forward earnings. However, NVDA\u2019s rivals or the peer group\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 16.4X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTherefore, investors should wait for the right entry point to buy the stock so it doesn\u2019t burn a hole in your pocket. Those who have invested in NVIDIA should stick to it since the stock has a strong upside. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Title": "Five Reasons to Stay Bullish on Nvidia Stock (NVDA) After Recent Corrections",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) ultra-bullish trend in the first half of the year has paused, with the stock failing to reach new peaks over the past few months. Following the highly anticipated Q2 earnings report at the end of August, Nvidia stock experienced a pullback due to elevated investor expectations for hypergrowth, despite the strong results it posted. I believe this price correction offers a compelling opportunity. In this article, I will outline five reasons for my bullish view on Nvidia, focusing on strong revenue growth (despite tough comps), AI dominance, valuation, technical indicators, and Wall Street analyst consensus.\nLet\u2019s dive in.\nThe first point supporting a prolonged bullish thesis for Nvidia is the solid revenue growth demonstrated in its Q2 results, despite challenging comparisons.\nNvidia posted 122% year-over-year growth in the most recent quarter, reaching revenues of $30 billion\u2014a remarkable achievement given the company\u2019s already substantial revenue base. Although this growth rate is lower than the 200% surge from the previous quarter, the absolute triple-digit top-line growth remains impressive. This underscores Nvidia\u2019s ability to scale its revenue significantly even when set against it\u2019s prior performance.\nWhile the post-Q2 stock pullback can be attributed to expectations being set too high, it\u2019s crucial to note that Nvidia continues to deliver sequential quarterly revenue growth, signaling robust demand for its products, especially in AI and data centers. This level of sustained growth at such a large scale highlights Nvidia\u2019s capacity to capture market share and drive long-term revenue expansion. Nvidia\u2019s Q3 sales guidance of $32.5 billion further reflects the company\u2019s confidence in maintaining its growth trajectory.\nThe second bullish point is Nvidia\u2019s continued dominance in the data center GPU space, where it holds a 98% market share in this rapidly growing sector, according to HPCwire.\nDemand for AI-driven solutions is booming across industries, with Nvidia\u2019s H100 Hopper GPU becoming crucial for enterprise cloud applications that require massive computing power. Beyond hardware, Nvidia dominates AI through its software ecosystem, including CUDA and cuDNN, offering a comprehensive AI solution. As highlighted in Nvidia\u2019s earnings call, the company aims to transform the $1 trillion data center market by shifting from traditional to accelerated computing using advanced data processing libraries.\nLooking ahead, Nvidia plans to launch its Blackwell architecture in Q4 of Fiscal 2025, offering greater power and efficiency than Hopper. Designed to meet the demands of hyperscalers and AI developers, Blackwell will provide comprehensive solutions, including chips, systems, networking, and software. This release is a key catalyst that will further solidify Nvidia\u2019s leadership in AI.\nThe third point concerns Nvidia\u2019s valuations. At first glance, its P/E ratio of 54.7x and forward P/E of 42.5x may seem high, especially compared to the semiconductor industry average of 23.7x. However, my bullish stance is strengthened by Nvidia\u2019s growth prospects, with the company expected to achieve 106% revenue growth and 119% EPS growth this year.\nFurthermore, analysts expect Nvidia\u2019s EPS to grow at a CAGR of 36.6% over the next three to five years. This impressive growth rate, combined with the current forward P/E, results in a reasonable forward price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.16.\nTraditionally, undervalued stocks have a PEG ratio below one, yet NVIDIA\u2019s PEG ratio is more favorable than those of all other Magnificent 7 stocks. Among this group, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta (META) have the next lowest PEG ratios at 1.28 and 1.48, respectively. While this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean NVIDIA is undervalued compared to its Big Tech peers, it does suggest that, according to this metric, the stock doesn\u2019t appear overly expensive.\nThe fourth point reinforcing the bullish thesis is closely tied to the sentiment surrounding Nvidia\u2019s stock performance. Despite recent fluctuations, the company\u2019s triple-digit revenue growth indicates that it is still in a hypergrowth phase. However, with a staggering 2,700% stock price surge over the past five years, concerns about a potential bubble remain.\nIn this context, I believe that focusing on long-term moving averages is essential for gauging momentum. This provides a clearer view of Nvidia\u2019s trend amid daily volatility, especially given the stock\u2019s 48% annualized volatility. NVDA stock\u2019s upward trend is supported by a current trading price above its 200-day moving average of $92.80.\nFinally, the fifth point contributing to my favorable outlook for Nvidia is the overwhelmingly bullish consensus among Wall Street analysts. Of the 42 analysts covering the stock, 39 have issued Buy recommendations, while the remaining three have a Hold rating. Moreover, the average price target among these analysts is $152.44, indicating potential upside of nearly 25%.\nA standout is Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann, who has the highest price target on Wall Street for Nvidia at $200 per share. His optimism persisted after the Q2 results, which he deemed strong, driven by growth in Hopper AI and networking. Although gross margins dipped slightly due to updates on Blackwell chips aimed at improving yields, Mosesmann remains confident. He highlights that despite potential short-term weakness in the share price, the bullish sentiment is supported by a 44x P/E multiple based on Fiscal 2027 EPS.\nIn this article, I\u2019ve outlined five key points supporting my Buy stance on Nvidia. I believe that the stock\u2019s recent weakness presents an attractive buying opportunity for investors eager to capitalize on its strong growth trajectory.\nWhile some short-term hiccups may persist, Nvidia\u2019s Q2 results suggest that its growth story is set to continue robustly as the company consolidates its market dominance and prepares for the upcoming release of the Blackwell architecture. Given the potential for further growth in the coming years, the current rich valuation can be justified, and Wall Street believes the same.\nDisclosure\nDisclaimer\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.\u00a0Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nInvestors are still digesting the Fed\u2019s aggressive rate cut and charting the path forward. Roger Altman, Evercore founder and senior chairman, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the Fed was not \u201cbehind the curve\u201d but it went with a higher-than-expected rate cut amid labor market concerns.\nAsked if he thinks we are headed toward a soft landing scenario, Altman said yes, as he believes growth is \u201cresilient\u201d and corporate profit outlook is good. Altman said equity markets are headed to have their best year since 1960.\n\u201cIf the landing is finished and the Fed hits its target, Powell will deserve an A and it would be a pretty miraculous achievement,\u201d Altman said.\nWhile the analyst believes currently it\u2019s a \u201cnear perfect\u201d overall environment for the market, he did point to \u201cstorm clouds\u201d gathering over the international stage including the expanding crisis in the Middle East, Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and America\u2019s overall fiscal situation.\nFor this article we chose 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nBarclays Tom O\u2019Malley recently said in a note that spending on AI chips must rise to meet even modest expectations from large language model (LLM) developers. The analyst noted that the recent sell-off in AI chip stocks, especially after NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings, has raised concerns about whether the market is nearing a peak. However, O\u2019Malley emphasized that these fears overlook the significant compute needs required to power future AI models.\nBarclays identified three key takeaways for the semiconductor sector:\nFirst, the need for compute resources is expected to surge. For instance, by 2027, just three frontier models with 50 trillion parameters each could require around 20 million chips for training alone. The demand for compute is anticipated to outpace improvements in chip performance.\nSecond, a dual approach to AI accelerators is emerging. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD, and startups are expected to dominate in training and inference for frontier models, while hyperscale companies will rely on custom silicon for specialized tasks.\nThird, inference, where AI models apply learned knowledge, will play a significant role in monetizing frontier models. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) claims that 40% of its chips are already used for inference, with more providers focusing on this market to drive down costs and improve return on investment.\nO\u2019Malley concluded that the AI chip industry is still in its early stages, and higher investments in compute resources are critical to meet future demands.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put, Nvidia\u2019s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported better-than-expected fiscal first quarter results driven by strong demand from data centers. Additionally, management noted that large cloud service providers, contributing approximately 45% of data center sales, recognize the high return on investment offered by Nvidia\u2019s computing solutions, which are driving AI spending. The company also introduced its next-generation H200 chip, which nearly doubles the inference performance compared to the H100 chip, enhancing how trained AI models process new data. Lastly, management raised their fiscal second quarter guidance, noting that demand for their current H100 chips remains strong, and that demand for their next generation products is estimated to outstrip supply over the next year. We continue to believe the company is well positioned to potentially benefit from the growing AI data center workloads, which are driving demand for the increased interconnections and fully accelerated software stacks, thereby enabling leading application performance and fast result times.\u201d\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Why This Stock Could Be the Nvidia of Healthcare",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Over the last couple of years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as the world's next megatrend. Thus far, breakthroughs in generative AI have mostly revolved around the technology industry.\nIn particular, semiconductor specialist Nvidia is viewed as the engine powering the AI vehicle right now. Demand for its most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) has been off the charts, and investors have cheered on the stock accordingly. That said, many use cases for AI remain largely overlooked by investors.\nOne of them is how AI is creating exciting new opportunities in the healthcare space. Among the companies leading the charge for AI in the medical world are giant Novo Nordisk and a relatively tiny Hippocratic AI, but I see Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) as the top opportunity. Here's why.\nAI can impact several areas along the healthcare spectrum, including service-oriented jobs such as nursing, software platforms, and hardware devices.\nAccording to Precedence Research, the global total addressable market (TAM) for healthcare AI sits at around $26.7 billion today. This market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 37% from 2024 to 2034 -- reaching $614 billion. The U.S. healthcare AI market alone is forecast to be worth $195 billion by 2034.\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the healthcare industry right now is staffing. According to a report published by multinational conglomerate Philips, staffing shortages in hospital settings are spurring demand for more digital infrastructure in the form of automation solutions.\nA start-up called Hippocratic AI is tackling that worker shortage head-on by developing healthcare agents powered by large language models (LLM). The company is essentially seeking to bring artificial general intelligence to the healthcare world and is leveraging Nvidia's Avatar Cloud Engine to do it.\nAnother influential company that is helping bridge the gap between healthcare and AI is Danish pharmaceutical powerhouse Novo Nordisk, the developer of diabetes and obesity care treatments Ozempic and Wegovy.\nNovo Nordisk is teaming up with French IT company Atos to develop a supercomputer that is meant to spearhead research in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. It will be powered by GPUs from both Nvidia and Intel, and will be stored within one of Digital Realty's data centers in Denmark.\nWhile the projects from Novo Nordisk and Hippocratic AI are exciting, I think there are some risks surrounding their ambitions. For starters, Hippocratic AI is still a start-up. It could take quite a long time before the company makes significant inroads in treating patients (assuming it does at all). Furthermore, I see Novo Nordisk's supercomputing project as quite broad -- making the investment prospects a little unattractive.\nBy contrast, Eli Lilly has identified a specific opportunity to pursue and is leveraging AI to find solutions. Namely, it has teamed up with ChatGPT developer OpenAI to assist with research for treating drug-resistant pathogens.\nAccording to a report from MarketsandMarkets, the global market size for antimicrobial resistance will reach $7.7 billion by 2028. In addition, the World Bank is forecasting that the negative economic impacts of antimicrobial resistance could top $1 trillion annually by 2030.\nEli Lilly is already celebrated as one of the world's leading drug companies. Its portfolio includes many blockbusters, including Verzenio, Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, Mounjaro, and Zepbound. Moreover, the company is about to make a splash in the $31 billion Alzheimer's disease market.\nNot only is Eli Lilly focusing on a large and underserved area of the healthcare realm, but it's teaming up with one of the biggest names in AI to tackle that challenge. I suspect it will take years before Lilly has a breakthrough in developing an effective new antimicrobial drug that works against bacteria that have become resistant to currently available treatments. Or, its efforts could ultimately fail.\nHowever, if I had to choose one company that I see as most likely to find success at the intersection of AI and healthcare, I would choose Eli Lilly. Given its long track record in drug development and its commitment to innovation, I see some parallels between Nvidia's signature on the tech sector and Eli Lilly's influence in healthcare.\nI think it's laying the groundwork for long-term success and will achieve a new level of innovation beyond its medical laboratories. If investors are looking for a high-growth opportunity in healthcare AI, I see Eli Lilly as the best choice.\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Ian King and Leah Nylen ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- The US Justice Department sent subpoenas to Nvidia Corp. and other companies as it seeks evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws, an escalation of its investigation into the dominant provider of AI processors.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWorld's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It\nThe Plan for the World\u2019s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation\nMadrid to Ban E-Scooter Rentals, Following Lead Set in Paris\nThe Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office\nThe DOJ, which had previously delivered questionnaires to companies, is now sending legally binding requests that oblige recipients to provide information, according to people familiar with the investigation. That takes the government a step closer to launching a formal complaint.\nAntitrust officials are concerned that Nvidia is making it harder to switch to other suppliers and penalizes buyers that don\u2019t exclusively use its artificial intelligence chips, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.\nSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\nNvidia shares, which suffered a record-setting $279 billion rout on Tuesday, fell further in late trading after Bloomberg reported on the subpoenas. Still, the stock has more than doubled this year \u2014 fueled by explosive sales growth at the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker.\nAs part of the probe, which Bloomberg previously reported in June, investigators have been contacting other technology companies to gather information. The DOJ\u2019s San Francisco office is taking the lead running the inquiry, the people said. A representative for the DOJ declined to comment.\nIn response to questions about the probe, Nvidia said that its market dominance stems from the quality of its products, which deliver faster performance.\n\u201cNvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, who can choose whatever solution is best for them,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.\nNvidia has drawn regulatory scrutiny since becoming the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker and a key beneficiary of the AI spending boom. Sales have been more than doubling each quarter, and it\u2019s eclipsed onetime chip leaders such as Intel Corp.\nIn the DOJ probe, regulators have been investigating Nvidia\u2019s acquisition of RunAI, a deal announced in April. That company makes software for managing AI computing, and there are concerns that the tie-up will make it more difficult for customers to switch away from Nvidia chips. Regulators also are inquiring whether Nvidia gives preferential supply and pricing to customers who use its technology exclusively or buy its complete systems, according to the people.\nNvidia, founded in 1993, made its name by selling graphics cards to computer gamers. But its approach to chipmaking ultimately proved useful for building AI models, a process that involves bombarding the software with data. The company also has rapidly expanded its lineup with a range of software, servers, networking and services \u2014 all aimed, Nvidia argues, at speeding up the deployment of AI.\nNvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he prioritizes customers who can make use of his products in ready-to-go data centers as soon as he provides them, a policy designed to prevent stockpiling and speed up the broader adoption of AI.\nThe success of its products \u2014 along with struggles by rivals to field alternative chips \u2014 has made Nvidia a crucial part of the supply chain for some of the biggest companies in the world. Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc., for example, spend more than 40% of their budget for hardware on the chipmaker\u2019s gear. During the peak of shortages of Nvidia\u2019s H100 accelerator, individual components were retailing for as much as $90,000 each.\nWATCH: How Nvidia Changed the Game\nAnalysts project that Nvidia will chalk up $120.8 billion of revenue in calendar 2024, up from $16 billion in 2020, with most of that money coming from its data center unit. In fact, Nvidia is set to bring in more profit this year than the total sales of its nearest rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc.\nThere also are broader regulatory questions about Nvidia\u2019s practices. Access to AI capabilities has become a key focus for governments around the world, with the technology becoming increasingly vital to economic strength and national security.\n(Updates with Nvidia response starting in sixth paragraph.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have taken a beating over the past few days, merely weeks after a broader market selloff in the technology sector that shook the entire finance industry.\u00a0 Shares of several prominent AI companies like have all witnessed high single digit drops in the space of just 24 hours. The NVIDIA selloff has wiped nearly $300 billion off the market value of the company. The growth-heavy NASDAQ Composite has registered a more than 3% drop in a single day of trading. AI valuations are bloated, no doubt, and the recent bear market has erased nearly $1 trillion in value from AI firms in just a few hours.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThe concerns around top AI chipmaker stem from recent reports that authorities in the US are growing uneasy about the near monopoly of the firm in terms of GPU provision. The stock's outperformance in this regard has delighted investors - the chipmaker is doing business with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta - but it has invited the ire of the Justice Department. The department is speculated to be in the process of sending a subpoena to the company, binding the business to provide certain information, in relation to an antitrust case. The purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli firm specializing in GPU orchestration software, back in April is believed to be one of the bones of contention between the AI chipmaker and the government.\nMacro developments are also weighing on the AI stocks in the near term. Commodity markets around the world are absorbing less than impressive growth numbers from China, impacting prices of copper and rare earths. Copper and rare earth metals are extensively used in AI devices, from chips to batteries. Lates US manufacturing data also paints a not so good picture for factories. According to authorities, US manufacturing witnessed a further decline in new orders and rise in inventory during August, even as manufacturing overall contracted at a modest pace. In addition to these factors, new investment notes on AI from JPMorgan and BlackRock, questioning the ROI on ballooning AI capex, have also grabbed media headlines.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings.

Earlier this week, Tesla chief Elon Musk announced that Colossal, an AI training system, had been brought online by his AI startup, xAI. xAI is valued at around $24 billion. The system is powered by 100,000 H100 graphic processing units (GPUs) made by NVIDIA. This AI model is the most powerful ever built. For context, the AI model of Google uses a cluster of 90,000 GPUs while the one at Meta uses 70,000. The H100 GPUs are slowly being replaced by H200, and the rumored Blackwell-based GPUs. Musk has already announced that Colossal would double in size by shifting to H200 GPUs in the coming months.\nAmid uncertainty around the production ramp for Blackwell, the H200 GPUs marketed by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are becoming increasingly popular. The H200 comes with 141 gigabytes of HBM3E memory and 4.8 terabytes per second of bandwidth. Musk claims only 50,000 H200 GPUs would double the size of Colossal if the H100 GPUs were replaced. In comparison, the latest Blackwell chips are even faster and more efficient. The top-end capacity of Blackwell GPUs would be 36% higher than the H200 and 66% higher in total bandwidth.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. is teaming up with Abu Dhabi-based G42 to create a climate technology lab, marking its first partnership with the United Arab Emirates\u2019 top artificial intelligence firm.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nEric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes\nWaiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development\nExclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million\nUnlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad\nNY\u2019s MTA Warns Against Borrowing More Than $13 Billion\nThe two companies will work on developing AI that can improve the accuracy of weather forecasting, according to a statement Friday. They will rely on Nvidia\u2019s Earth-2, an open platform that can make climate and weather predictions.\nThe climate tech lab, located in Abu Dhabi, \u201cwill serve as a hub for research and development, driving forward both companies\u2019 commitment to environmental sustainability,\u201d according to the statement. It will also \u201cmobilize the creation of tailored climate and weather solutions that leverage over 100 petabytes of geophysical data assets.\u201d\nNvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of an artificial intelligence spending boom, has been speeding up development of new products and expanding its footprint.

        "Text": "Nvidia Corp. dominates coverage of the semiconductor manufacturing space, and rightly so. But many other chip makers are expected to put up impressive numbers over the next two years.\nNvidia NVDA has commanded the market for graphics processing units being deployed by data centers to support their corporate clients\u2019 development of artificial-intelligence technology. The company has been showing dramatic increases in revenue for the past five reported fiscal quarters. Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization has increased to $2.61 trillion from $358 billion two years ago. The company\u2019s stock now makes up 5.7% of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the oldest and largest exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500 SPX. Only Apple Inc. AAPL and Microsoft Corp. MSFT are weighted more heavily in the index.\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to be unfair\u2019: My mother gave me $150,000 to buy a house. One sibling wants 15% ownership. What now?\n\u2018He won\u2019t evict him\u2019: My husband told me to pay for his tenant\u2019s rental expenses. He said, \u2018You offered to help.\u2019 How do I tell him to take care of his own affairs?\nThe stock market was briefly unsettled by CPI report. Here\u2019s why.\n\u2018I don\u2019t want anyone telling me what to do\u2019: My second husband wants to put our $750,000 home in a trust for his children. Does he have the right?\nFed rate cuts aren\u2019t even here yet. Wall Street\u2019s booming commercial real-estate business isn\u2019t waiting.\nNvidia more than doubled sales last calendar year, and it\u2019s expected to do the same this year. The company likely won\u2019t be able to keep up that rapid rate of growth going forward, but it\u2019s still expected to be a relatively fast grower within its sector.\nAnalysts on average model a nearly 33% compound annual growth rate for Nvidia\u2019s revenue through calendar 2026. That\u2019s notable as some investors have started to get worried about Nvidia\u2019s growth potential for calendar 2026, especially in light of a less dramatic revenue beat in the latest quarter and swirling questions about the return on investment for AI spending. If big cloud customers and others don\u2019t see enough AI revenue to justify their investments, they may be less inclined to pour more money into AI hardware.\nWhen a company essentially creates a large and lucrative new market, the competition can be expected to up its game and take a share eventually. Or maybe in the case of Nvidia, there will be a breather for GPU implementation as companies investing so much in new hardware feel pressure to derive profits from AI-related related products and services.\nSo this is a good time to look ahead. We can do this by calculating expected compound growth rates for semiconductor-industry players\u2019 revenue over the next two years.\nFor this screen we started with the 30 components of the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, which tracks the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX. Then we added the 31 additional companies in the S&P 1500 Composite Index XX:SP1500 that are in the semiconductor industry, as determined by FactSet, or in the Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment Global Industry Classification Standard group, as per companies\u2019 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The S&P Composite 1500 Index is made up of the S&P 500 SPX, the S&P MidCap 400 Index MID and the S&P Small Cap 600 Index SML.\nThen we looked at calendar-year revenue estimates through 2026 among analysts polled by FactSet to see which companies are expected to show the highest two-year sales CAGR. We used estimates for calendar years, as adjusted by FactSet, because many companies confuse investors with fiscal years that don\u2019t match the calendar. For example, on Aug. 28, Nvidia announced results for the second quarter of its fiscal 2025.\nAmong the 61 companies in our initial group of manufacturers and designers of semiconductors and related equipment, consensus sales estimates were available through calendar 2026 for 53 companies.\nAmong the 53 remaining companies, there are the 17 for which sales are expected to increase at an annualized pace of more than 20% from calendar 2024 through calendar 2026. Calendar-year sales estimates are in millions.\nCompany\nTicker\nExpected two-year sales CAGR through 2026\nEst. 2024 sales\nEst. 2025 sales\nEst. 2026 sales\nSolarEdge Technologies Inc.\nSEDG\n45.1%\n$1,089\n$1,905\n$2,294\nWolfspeed Inc.\nWOLF\n39.8%\n$868\n$1,150\n$1,696\nSilicon Laboratories Inc.\nSLAB\n33.2%\n$603\n$903\n$1,070\nNvidia Corp.\nNVDA\n32.9%\n$120,095\n$174,920\n$212,166\nEnphase Energy Inc.\nENPH\n30.1%\n$1,400\n$2,026\n$2,369\nCohu Inc.\nCOHU\n28.4%\n$406\n$531\n$670\nSiTime Corp.\nSITM\n26.5%\n$191\n$245\n$305\nMarvell Technology Inc.\nMRVL\n26.5%\n$5,531\n$7,289\n$8,850\nMaxLinear Inc.\nMXL\n24.8%\n$357\n$446\n$556\nMicron Technology Inc.\nMU\n24.4%\n$29,600\n$40,738\n$45,781\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc.\nAMD\n24.1%\n$25,599\n$32,819\n$39,448\nFirst Solar Inc.\nFSLR\n22.4%\n$4,489\n$5,670\n$6,723\nTeradyne Inc.\nTER\n22.4%\n$2,786\n$3,424\n$4,171\nASML Holding NV ADR\nASML\n20.8%\n$30,358\n$40,016\n$44,314\nOnto Innovation Inc.\nONTO\n20.7%\n$980\n$1,157\n$1,429\nUniversal Display Corp.\nOLED\n20.3%\n$663\n$757\n$960\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ADR\nTSM\n20.1%\n$86,576\n$106,839\n$124,840\nSource: FactSet\nTo put these expected revenue growth rates into perspective, the two-year estimated sales CAGR through 2026 for the PHLX Semiconductor Index is 17.1%. This index has a modified market-cap weighting with an 8% maximum when the underlying index is rebalanced quarterly.\nShares of SolarEdge Technologies Inc. SEDG, which leads the list, have had a brutal year, falling more than 80% over the course of 2024 to date. The company makes technology for solar-power generation, and it\u2019s been hurt by a weak solar market and general sector pressure.\nDespite analysts\u2019 projections for fast sales growth going forward, the company faces financial challenges elsewhere. In launching coverage of SolarEdge shares with a hold rating earlier this month, Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith said that \u201dthe path forward is opaque with continued negative [free cash flow].\u201d SolarEdge has also become a popular short play, with short interest amounting to more than 30% of the float, according to FactSet data.\nOther solar plays, including Enphase Energy Inc. ENPH, place among the top projected sales growers as well. \u201cWe recognize the re-acceleration in growth ahead but ultimately see the recovery and upside from domestic content priced-in with execution risk ahead,\u201d Dumoulin-Smith wrote in taking up coverage of Enphase shares, also with a hold rating.\nWolfspeed Inc. WOLF ranks second on the list for expected sales CAGR through 2026. The company specializes in making electronic components using silicon carbide for electric vehicles. It also provides components for charging and power storage equipment. The company isn\u2019t expected to show a quarterly profit for at least two more years, according to FactSet\u2019s consensus estimates. Most analysts have neutral ratings for Wolfspeed\u2019s stock. In a note to clients on Aug. 22, following the company\u2019s most recent quarterly report, Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch wrote that some of investors\u2019 concerns about the company\u2019s financial health were being addressed by a cut in planned capital expenditures and the expectations of federal funding through the CHIPS Act.\nNext up is Silicon Laboratories Inc. SLAB, an analog and mixed-signal chip company that is expected to post its second calendar year in a row of declining sales in 2024 before rebounding big through 2026.\nThat hits on a general trend in the semiconductor sector. If you focus just on the AI craze, you might think the chip sector is universally hot, but many areas of the market including automotive and industrial semiconductors have faced recent pressure. That sets companies up for big potential revenue recoveries if their end markets turn around.\nThe issue of Nvidia\u2019s forecast moving through calendar 2026 is especially topical as investors think about AI returns. Mizuho desk-based analyst Jordan Klein wrote ahead of Nvidia\u2019s late-August earnings report that the top question on the buy side concerns the growth outlook for cloud capital spending in calendar 2026 versus calendar 2025.\n\u201cNobody really knows,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInvestors feel good about this year and 2025 for sure, but in 6-8 months,\u00a0[Nvidia\u2019s stock]\u00a0will trade off\u00a0[calendar-year 2026 estimates] and those will rely heavily on biggest GPU and AI compute buyers, or the cloud hyperscalers (vs sovereigns, enterprise, edge devices).\u201d\nMeanwhile, rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD sits just outside the top 10 in terms of expected CAGR through 2026. The company seeks to claw into Nvidia\u2019s dominant market share in AI GPUs, and it also could benefit if some of its non-AI businesses recover. For instance, AMD\u2019s gaming business saw a 61% revenue decline in the latest quarter and is expected to post sharp declines in the next two as well, before getting back into positive growth territory.\nOn AI, there\u2019s plenty of market opportunity for AMD in the near term, but its rival certainly isn\u2019t sitting still. Nvidia is targeting a one-year product cadence for new offerings, which should keep AMD on its heels.\nLeaving the group in the same order, here is a summary of opinion for these stocks among analysts working for brokerage firms polled by FactSet:\nCompany\nTicker\nShare buy ratings\nShare neutral ratings\nShare sell ratings\nSept. 9 price\nConsensus price target\nImplied 12-month upside potential\nSolarEdge Technologies Inc.\nSEDG\n17%\n74%\n9%\n$17.94\n$30.88\n72%\nWolfspeed Inc.\nWOLF\n32%\n57%\n11%\n$7.59\n$18.71\n147%\nSilicon Laboratories Inc.\nSLAB\n42%\n50%\n8%\n$105.54\n$139.75\n32%\nNvidia Corp.\nNVDA\n94%\n6%\n0%\n$106.47\n$149.12\n40%\nEnphase Energy Inc.\nENPH\n55%\n38%\n7%\n$103.04\n$127.57\n24%\nCohu Inc.\nCOHU\n57%\n29%\n14%\n$23.35\n$32.71\n40%\nSiTime Corp.\nSITM\n86%\n0%\n14%\n$133.53\n$138.33\n4%\nMarvell Technology Inc.\nMRVL\n94%\n6%\n0%\n$68.93\n$93.25\n35%\nMaxLinear Inc.\nMXL\n45%\n55%\n0%\n$13.33\n$21.33\n60%\nMicron Technology Inc.\nMU\n93%\n5%\n2%\n$86.27\n$171.13\n98%\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc.\nAMD\n81%\n19%\n0%\n$138.15\n$186.67\n35%\nFirst Solar Inc.\nFSLR\n78%\n22%\n0%\n$205.36\n$291.94\n42%\nTeradyne Inc.\nTER\n53%\n42%\n5%\n$124.20\n$145.47\n17%\nASML Holding NV ADR\nASML\n77%\n20%\n3%\n$749.82\n$1,124.12\n50%\nOnto Innovation Inc.\nONTO\n100%\n0%\n0%\n$180.63\n$261.21\n45%\nUniversal Display Corp.\nOLED\n75%\n25%\n0%\n$190.24\n$228.89\n20%\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Since the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) early last year, the star of the show has been Nvidia. The company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that have become the gold standard for AI training and inference applications. This, in turn, has resulted in a blistering run for the stock, which has gained 639% (as of this writing) since early last year. As a result, Nvidia's market cap has grown by leaps and bounds, currently valued at $2.6 trillion.\nYet concerns about the growing threat of competition and Nvidia's premium valuation have some investors looking for other ways to profit from AI -- and they don't have to look far. One company is about to get swept up by the tailwinds of AI, driving its market cap to more than $4 trillion over the coming year or so -- iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\nThe stock's pedigree is undeniable. Since its IPO in 1980, Apple has delivered gains of 225,071%. That stratospheric rise isn't limited to the distant past, either. Apple soared 792% over the past 10 years (as of this writing), more than four and a half times the return of the S&P 500.\nYet Apple stock could soar even higher on the secular tailwinds of AI. Let's review the factors that could push the iPhone maker above $4 trillion.\nInvestors might not be thinking of Apple as a supercharged growth stock, but its record is undeniable. Over the past decade, the company's revenue has grown 104%, while its net income has climbed 153%, which has fueled its soaring stock price.\nApple's growth has come as the company has captured an ever-increasing share of the smartphone market. In the list of top 10 smartphones of 2023, Apple devices took the top seven spots, according to data supplied by Counterpoint Research. What makes that achievement all the more remarkable is that it occurred during one of the worst economic downturns in decades.\nNow that the specter of inflation is fading, consumers will be more likely to upgrade their devices. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives estimates there are roughly 300 million active iPhones that haven't been upgraded in more than four years. Improving economic conditions will leave people with more discretionary income, increasing the likelihood they will opt for a new iPhone when Apple's new models are unveiled next week. Ives estimates the company could sell as many as 240 million iPhones in fiscal 2025, kicking off an AI-driven upgrade \"super cycle.\"\nWhile some users snap up the newest iPhone as soon as it becomes available, many tend to wait for a major upgrade before laying out their hard-earned cash for a new device. The upcoming model is expected to be a doozy. While Apple is playing its cards close to the vest, the company is expected to unveil the first iPhone featuring generative AI capabilities, marking a new chapter for Apple.\nAt the company's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June, Apple provided the first look at Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-powered features that will be included in an upcoming iOS update. These include:\nAI-powered summaries in Mail and Messages\nVoicemail transcriptions\nImproved photo searches\nLong-awaited improvements to Siri\nTroubleshooting help for Apple devices\nImage and text generation\nIntegration of OpenAI's ChatGPT\nWall Street and Main Street alike have been captivated by the potential of generative AI, and many iPhone users will be interested to see what Apple brings to the table.\nMake no mistake: Apple's results have always been tied to sales of its flagship iPhone, and that's unlikely to change anytime soon. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (which will end in September), the iPhone was responsible for 52% of Apple's total sales, so the path to $4 trillion goes through the iPhone.\nAccording to Wall Street, Apple is poised to generate revenue of $390 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 8.6. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Apple would have to grow its revenue to roughly $465 billion annually to support a $4 trillion market cap. The company could conservatively surpass this threshold by early 2027.\nIves is more bullish. He believes that if Apple introduces compelling AI technology with its up-and-coming iPhone -- and I believe it will -- this will act as the linchpin for the next phase of the company's growth. Not only will Apple likely sell the aforementioned 240 million iPhones in fiscal 2025, but the accompanying sales of hardware and software will combine to add $30 to $40 to Apple's share price, pushing its market cap above $4 trillion over the coming 12 to 18 months.\nIt's important to remember this is fun with math, but the underlying thesis is sound. Earlier this year, Apple revealed there were 2.2 billion active devices in the world, including an estimated 1.4 billion active iPhones, according to online data company Statista. A compelling new AI-powered iPhone could be the catalyst for a significant upgrade cycle.\nApple is currently selling for a premium at roughly 33 times earnings, but given its track record of growth, I'd argue it's deserved. Furthermore, when the aforementioned \"super cycle\" plays out -- and I have no doubt it will -- this price could end up being a bargain.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other buzzing AI stocks.\nThe Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 2024, held earlier this month, brought several significant updates on the technology sector for investors, particularly focusing on innovation and financial growth across growth industries. Key discussions revolved around energy-efficient computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and advanced semiconductor technologies, signaling critical transformations in tech and telecommunications. At the conference, companies working in the tech universe outlined their strategic outlooks, emphasizing the role of energy-efficient computing in driving semiconductor growth, with industries like AI, IoT, robotics, and autonomous vehicles fueling multi-trillion-dollar shifts.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOne of the highlights of the conference was the appearance of NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, who appeared alongside Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon to discuss the AI industry in great detail. Quizzed about the recent US export controls on chips to China and the rise in geopolitical tensions potentially harming supplies, Huang outlined that his company was confident that if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the Taiwan-based leading supplier of advanced AI chips to NVIDIA, was compromised, the chip supply would continue, even though it would not be as good. Huang stressed that NVIDIA possessed enough intellectual property to transfer chip production from one plant to another, if need be.\nNVIDIA has lost more than 15% of market capitalization since it issued third quarter guidance numbers that raised worries about slowing earnings growth. In particular, there were concerns about the concentration of hyperscalers in the NVIDIA business model, with four large customers representing nearly half of the revenue of the firm in relation to the AI boom. Following the appearance of Huang at the conference, Goldman Sachs semiconductor analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, backing the company to pick up sales in the coming months as demand for accelerated computing continued to be really strong and broadened into enterprise and sovereign states.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through the proceedings of the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The CEO of the firm, Jensen Huang, spoke at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference earlier this month, highlighting the importance of NVIDIA to the AI revolution and asserting that the hardware the company made was translating into fantastic returns for companies that were using it. Huang said that the infrastructure players like his firm and all the cloud service providers put the AI infrastructure in the cloud so that developers could use the machines to train and fine-tune their AI models. He noted that for every dollar a cloud service provider spent with NVIDIA, it translated to $5 worth of rentals.\nHuang also stressed that the days of every line of code being written by software engineers were completely over. He instead forecast a future where every NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) employee - the firm presently has around 32,000 employees - would be supplemented by 100x more digital engineers. He claimed that the first trillion dollars of data centers was going to get accelerated and invent this new type of software called generative AI, which was not just a tool but a skill.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0among the buzzing AI stocks to buy according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Is Nvidia Still a Millionaire-Maker Stock?",
        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The stock market is ideal for slowly building wealth over decades. However, some investors have sped things up by betting on the right companies at the right times.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a great example. If you had bought $5,000 worth of its stock 10 years ago, you would have around $1.25 million today -- a return of 25,000%. Does the legendary chipmaker still have millionaire-maker potential? Let's dig deeper to find out. \nIn 1993, Nvidia was founded to pioneer a niche computer chip called the graphics processing unit (GPU). These chips excel at processing multiple tasks simultaneously, making them ideal for rendering complex visuals. Most of Nvidia's early growth came from serving the video game industry, where its chips were used in custom PCs and consoles.\nHowever, the 2009 launch of Bitcoin (and the subsequent rise of cryptocurrencies) was the company's first big break. At the time, most blockchain networks ran on a system called proof-of-work (PoW), which required participants called miners to solve complex computations to validate transactions and create new coins.\nGPUs were perfect for this task. And Nvidia's revenue and profits soared in response to this new market. As mining demand faded after the pandemic, ChatGPT's launch in 2022 kicked off another boom cycle for the company and its quintessential hardware products. \nWhile past performance doesn't guarantee future results, Nvidia's history demonstrates a distinct boom-and-bust pattern. The chipmaker has produced many millionaires over the long term, but investors who bought shares at the peaks of previous hype cycles faced substantial losses as they waited for the company to discover new opportunities. \nUnfortunately, the AI hype cycle is getting long in the tooth. And Wall Street is getting nervous. According to projections from the nonprofit RAND Corporation, more than 80% of AI projects could eventually fail -- double the rate for non-AI-related tech start-ups.\nThere are many reasons for the high failure rate, but the most obvious is that AI technology simply isn't easy to monetize. Mainstream large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Gemini are fun to play around with, but they can be unreliable and expensive to run because of the high costs of hardware and energy.\n These platforms also face stiff competition from free, open-source alternatives like Meta Platform's Llama or Elon Musk's Grok. If the consumer-facing software side of the market doesn't start carrying its weight, demand growth for Nvidia's hardware could eventually slow or even reverse. \nIf Nvidia's business is on the verge of a spectacular crash, there have been no signs of it yet. Second-quarter earnings were another slam dunk, with revenue increasing 122% year over year to $30 billion while operating income jumped 156% to $19.9 billion. \nAnd management believes the launch of GPUs based on the new Blackwell architecture will help maintain its spectacular momentum over the coming years.\nThe stock's valuation is also extremely attractive. With a forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 41, shares are more expensive than the Nasdaq 100 estimate of 29. But this is actually surprisingly cheap for a company growing its top and bottom lines at triple-digit rates. \nThe market seems to be discounting Nvidia's shares on fears that the AI industry might not meet expectations. The stock still has millionaire-maker potential, but long-term investors might want to wait for the current hype cycle to fade before betting on the chipmaker's next big break.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Stefon Walters, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There isn't a stock on the market that has been talked about more in the past two years than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has made Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) one of the most sought-after products because of their role in training AI.\nIt has also made Nvidia one of the hottest stocks on the market. From September 2022 to the start of September 2024, its stock rose over 750% -- 18 times more than the S&P 500's gains over that span. That's not an easy feat for a company whose market cap was around $300 million at the time.\nNvidia has also posted financial results to back this hype, increasing revenue and operating income by 122% and 174%, respectively. The praise is well deserved. That said, there are two companies that I'd be more likely to invest in at this point because there seems to be more long-term certainty around their businesses.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) (TSMC) is one of the world's most-important tech companies despite not being a household name like some other big tech companies. It operates the world's largest semiconductor (chip) foundry, manufacturing chips for companies' specific needs.\nCompanies come to TSMC with a chip design, and it produces the chip according to the company's request. It may seem simple enough, but manufacturing chips with that level of precision and at that scale requires complex processes (putting it lightly) and advanced technology that no other company has been able to match.\nOne company that relies heavily on TSMC is Nvidia. TSMC manufactures Nvidia's chips for its GPUs, data-center processors, and other AI-related chips. Without TSMC's manufacturing capabilities, there's a strong case that Nvidia's products would take a quality hit. That's largely why Nvidia hasn't embraced other chip manufacturers and is comfortable relying on TSMC.\nNvidia's dependence on TSMC is why I prefer it at this stage. Much of Nvidia's high valuation is built on expectations of what it should become, and its ability to deliver on that will depend on TSMC's production capacity. The ceiling may not be nearly as high for TSMC, but its trajectory is seemingly more reliable.\nTSMC also has an attractive dividend that reduces some of the investing risk. Its dividend yield is currently above the S&P 500's average, making it easier for investors to remain patient during rocky times and trust its long-term potential.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) didn't reach the point of being the world's most valuable public company by mistake; it has taken decades of non-complacency and disciplined execution. With Apple's track record of discipline, it was puzzling why so many Wall Street investors were seemingly shocked as Apple remained relatively quiet during recent AI mania.\nApple has a history of letting other companies create something and then venturing into that area with a much better design and making it more user friendly. We've seen it with smartphones (iPhone), tablets (iPad), smartwatches (Apple Watch), virtual reality (Apple Vision Pro), and handfuls of other tech hardware.\nOf course, Apple isn't just going around copying others; rather, the tech giant does a great job of letting others be the guinea pigs and then learning perhaps from their missteps before releasing its own products and services to the market. That seems to be the same approach it's taking with AI, too.\nApple hasn't rushed into AI like most other big tech companies. In fact, it doesn't even refer to its coming AI capabilities as \"artificial intelligence\"; it's \"Apple Intelligence.\" (It's just clever enough to work.) Nvidia is in a volatile position; just as fast as it rose, it can fall if it fails to meet expectations. Apple doesn't quite have that same risk, though it's not exempt from volatility.\nIdeally, Apple Intelligence will give Apple an immediate financial boost, with consumers rushing to buy its next-gen products since it'll only be accessible on newer hardware models. After a slump in Apple's smartphone market over the past few years, I'm sure the company wouldn't mind an extra lift from somewhere.\nShort-term boost aside, there aren't too many companies I trust more long term than Apple. The upside always seems to outweigh the potential downside.\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 stands against the other AI news you probably missed.\nThe AI industry continues to demonstrate remarkable growth, underpinned by advancements in generative AI, machine learning, and data analytics. Analysts across major research firms and financial institutions remain optimistic about the growth trajectory of AI, predicting sustained expansion through 2025 and beyond. For example, according to Gartner, the AI software market is expected to reach $135 billion by the end of 2025, reflecting a 21% year-over-year growth. This surge is driven largely by the adoption of AI in various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and retail. Research by McKinsey similarly indicates that AI could add as much as $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, making it a critical driver of economic growth.\nA Bloomberg report also echoes these projections, highlighting that venture capital investment in AI startups has continued at a rapid pace, even amid broader economic downturns in technology. In the first half of 2024, over $40 billion in venture capital was funneled into AI-focused firms. Much of this funding targets generative AI, a subfield of AI that has gained attention for its ability to produce human-like text, images, and designs. According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, generative AI could boost global productivity by 7% over the next decade, contributing an additional $4.4 trillion to the global economy.

        "Text": "We came across a\u00a0bullish thesis\u00a0on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) on Multibagger Nuggets\u2019s Substack by Kris. In this article we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on NVDA. NVDA Technologies, Inc. share was trading at $119.10 as of Sept 13th.\nNvidia\u2019s revenue growth has slowed but remains at impressive triple-digit percentages, which was anticipated. The company is expected to see additional revenue from its acquisition of Blackwell in Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. Evaluating Nvidia\u2019s Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) over a normalized five-year period, including the pandemic, shows a solid performance. Its five-year ROIC stands at 54.77%, an increase of nearly 3%, demonstrating strong capital efficiency.\nDespite Nvidia currently trading at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 55.97, which may seem high, its forward PE ratio, after a recent price drop, is around 31.5. While this isn\u2019t particularly cheap, it is justified given Nvidia's high-quality business. Nvidia\u2019s forward PEG ratio, currently at 31.46, is significantly undervalued when considering its projected earnings growth of 120% this year, giving a PEG of just 0.26 for 2024. A PEG under 1 is considered cheap, making this valuation extremely attractive.\nLooking ahead to 2025, Nvidia\u2019s earnings are expected to grow by 40%, with a forward PE of 26.7, resulting in a 2025 PEG of 0.67. Even further out, in 2026, earnings are expected to grow by 18.3%, with a forward PE of 22.55, giving a PEG of 1.23, still considered reasonable. While these figures for 2026 are more speculative, Nvidia's historical performance suggests it can meet or exceed these expectations.\nSome critics suggest that Nvidia is in a bubble due to its dramatic stock price rise\u2014up 109% this year. However, this perception often focuses solely on price rather than valuation. Given that earnings are set to rise by 119%, Nvidia\u2019s valuation has actually become more attractive, not less. The company's ability to consistently beat expectations further supports its long-term growth potential.\nEven renowned valuation expert Aswath Damodaran\u2019s recent valuation of Nvidia at $87\u201417% below the current price\u2014appears overly conservative. His previous valuations similarly underestimated Nvidia, and the company surpassed those projections.

        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 8.3% in the morning session after the major indices declined (Nasdaq -2.6%, S&P 500 -1.6%). Markets are likely bracing for increased volatility ahead of the Fed's policy decision in September (2024). The consensus expectation is for the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points to 5.00% - 5.25% during the September 2024 meeting. This will be the first rate cut since the committee began raising rates to tackle inflation. Historically, September has been a challenging month for most assets. Notably, since the post-World War II era, major stock indices have consistently recorded significant losses in the month of September relative to other months.\nAdditional data to consider amidst the volatility include the labor market report to be released in the first week of September, and the CPI report the following week. Given the historical trends and upcoming Fed policy decision, investors may need to prepare for continued market uncertainty and potential downside risk in the weeks ahead.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nNvidia\u2019s shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 22 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today\u2019s move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 21 days ago, when the company gained 5.3% after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US producer price index (PPI - prices that businesses charge for their goods and services) in July 2024 increased 2.2% year on year, falling compared to the 2.7% y/y growth recorded in the previous month. The report also revealed a month-on-month growth of 0.1%, below analysts' estimates of 0.2%.\nIn addition, Core PPI (prices excluding food and energy) were flat month on month. PPI is often considered a leading indicator of CPI since what businesses pay tends to be passed through to consumers.\nOverall, the data confirmed that inflation is cooling off. This is a favorable data point supporting an interest rate cut by the Fed. Notably, markets expect the first rate cut to be announced during the September 2024 policy meeting.\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\nNvidia is up 129% since the beginning of the year, but at $110.09 per share it is still trading 18.8% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $26,823.\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in September.\u00a0Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nSam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that since 1990, the market on average gains about 18% between the last rate hike and the first rate cut. However, during the 30 days after the first rate cut, the market historically \u201ctread water,\u201d gaining less than \u201cone half of one percent.\u201d\n\u201cMost of the action is below surface however, in the sectors, areas where a lot of the leaders be in the defensive areas but I have to add technology in there because investors don\u2019t want to be giving up on the growth,\u201d Stovall said.\nStovall pointed to another important historical data point regarding election years. He said that usually August and September are slow months in the stock market, but during election years the trend shifts to September and October, with markets historically rebounding in November and December once the uncertainty around the election subsides. The analyst recommended investors to position for a post-election rally which he believes buoys growth stocks.\nFor this article, we chose the top 10 AI stocks currently on investors\u2019 radar following important news, earnings and analyst ratings. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nNew Street Research recently said in a note that AI infrastructure demand has no slowdown in sight and gave bullish comments about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm believes Nvidia\u2019s key advantage over its competitors like AMD is the full-stack and system-scale integration abilities of its GPUs. These allow for greater chip-to-chip bandwidth interconnect across a larger domain.\nComparing NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) with AMD, New Street Research analyst\u00a0 Pierre Ferragu said:\n\u201cIt nevertheless doesn\u2019t disqualify AMD, whose architecture is less versatile, less scalable, but can still be competitive, but on a much more limited set of use-cases, and at the cost of dedicated optimization efforts.\u201d\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports that were confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\nAt the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\nOf course, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in September. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the best future stocks for the long term.\nThe Fed plans to initiate rate cuts for the first time in over four years and investors do not know what to expect of the financial markets moving forward. On September 17, Stephen Juneau, Bank of America US economist, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss the impact of an unexpected growth in consumer spending on the economy.\nJuneau reiterated that economic data is highly volatile and that the retail data released this morning will not impact the Fed\u2019s rate cut decision tomorrow, and he expects the Fed to stick to a 25-basis point cut. As for consumer behavior, the economy is finally moving toward normalization and the consumer\u2019s basket of goods reflects that. These indications, the increasing labor demand, and a stable investment outlook hint that a hard landing is highly unlikely.\nOn September 17, Eric Freedman, US Bank Asset Management Group CIO, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss the rate cut and how investors view investing. Freedman said that the rate cut depends on the Fed\u2019s path, therefore an accurate prediction may not be possible at the moment.\nFreedman talks about investment from an individual perspective, suggesting investors must move out of the front end of the yield curve. He then pointed to sectors that are currently providing value to investors, including the consumer discretionary sector, some parts of the energy sector, and tech, especially because investments in the sector are predicted to grow rapidly, well into 2025.\nHe then discussed what companies need to do to attract investors. Freedman emphasized the need for strong financials and suggested that companies should engage in buybacks or consider increasing dividends. The perfect combination of stocks, according to Freedman, includes companies that are returning cash and seeing strong organic growth.\nThe future of the economy and the financial market is quite unpredictable. However, some stocks can influence the market not just now, but also in the future. With that, let\u2019s take a look at the best future stocks for the long term.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nTo come up with the 10 best future stocks for the long term we looked up growth stocks in the AI, Cloud, Cybersecurity, Biotechnology, Electric Vehicle, and Renewable Energy industries. We then ranked the stocks with the highest number of hedge funds as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most popular stocks at the moment, also referred to as the AI star. The GPU maker is known for its cloud solutions, chip systems, and growing role in producing artificial intelligence solutions.\nThe company logged $26.3 billion in data center revenue, up 16% from the previous quarter and 154% year-over-year. The revenue growth was driven by strong demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPU Computing platform. Compute revenue grew by 2.5x and networking revenue expanded by 2x compared to the previous year. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) logged $30 billion in revenue during the FQ2 of 2025, up by 122% year-over-year, well above its outlook of only $28 billion.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the best future stocks for the long term. Such can be attributed to its rapid advancements in technology and strategic partnerships. The company\u2019s networking platform for AI, Spectrum X, is projected to become a multi-billion dollar entity in a year. Moreover, the company just closed a deal with Salesforce allowing organizations to benefit from advanced AI and data capabilities. Nvidia\u2019s position in the market is solid and explains why it is referred to as the AI star.\nAnalysts are bullish on NVDA and their 12-month median price target of $150 points to a 30% upside from current levels. At the close of Q2 2024, 179 investors were bullish on NVDA, with total stakes amounting to $53.7 billion. Of those, Ken Griffin\u2019s\u00a0Citadel Investment Group\u00a0was the highest stakeholder with a position of $18.35 billion.\nIthaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs).

He then pointed to sectors that are currently providing value to investors, including the consumer discretionary sector, some parts of the energy sector, and tech, especially because investments in the sector are predicted to grow rapidly, well into 2025.\nHe then discussed what companies need to do to attract investors. Freedman emphasized the need for strong financials and suggested that companies should engage in buybacks or consider increasing dividends. The perfect combination of stocks, according to Freedman, includes companies that are returning cash and seeing strong organic growth.\nThe future of the economy and the financial market is quite unpredictable. However, some stocks can influence the market not just now, but also in the future. With that, let\u2019s take a look at the best future stocks for the long term.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nTo come up with the 10 best future stocks for the long term we looked up growth stocks in the AI, Cloud, Cybersecurity, Biotechnology, Electric Vehicle, and Renewable Energy industries. We then ranked the stocks with the highest number of hedge funds as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most popular stocks at the moment, also referred to as the AI star. The GPU maker is known for its cloud solutions, chip systems, and growing role in producing artificial intelligence solutions.\nThe company logged $26.3 billion in data center revenue, up 16% from the previous quarter and 154% year-over-year. The revenue growth was driven by strong demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPU Computing platform. Compute revenue grew by 2.5x and networking revenue expanded by 2x compared to the previous year. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) logged $30 billion in revenue during the FQ2 of 2025, up by 122% year-over-year, well above its outlook of only $28 billion.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the best future stocks for the long term. Such can be attributed to its rapid advancements in technology and strategic partnerships. The company\u2019s networking platform for AI, Spectrum X, is projected to become a multi-billion dollar entity in a year. Moreover, the company just closed a deal with Salesforce allowing organizations to benefit from advanced AI and data capabilities. Nvidia\u2019s position in the market is solid and explains why it is referred to as the AI star.\nAnalysts are bullish on NVDA and their 12-month median price target of $150 points to a 30% upside from current levels. At the close of Q2 2024, 179 investors were bullish on NVDA, with total stakes amounting to $53.7 billion. Of those, Ken Griffin\u2019s\u00a0Citadel Investment Group\u00a0was the highest stakeholder with a position of $18.35 billion.\nIthaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d\nOverall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best future stocks for the long-term. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Christiaan Hetzner ",
        "Text": "The brutal selloff in AI-chip stock Nvidia offers investors an attractive entry point, Goldman Sachs argued on Monday.\nFounder and CEO Jensen Huang has seen his company lose 17% of its market cap since issuing muted third-quarter guidance that sparked concerns its rapid earnings growth may not be sustainable. Only a handful of companies are currently fueling its booming AI chip business, with just four customers constituting nearly half of all Nvidia\u2019s revenue.\nSpeaking with Yahoo Finance on the sidelines of a tech conference hosted by his bank, Goldman Sachs semiconductor analyst Toshiya Hari remained confident sales will pick up as customers outside of the three cloud hyperscalers\u2014Amazon, Microsoft, and Google\u2014start to invest in their own AI compute clusters.\n\u201cDemand for accelerated computing continues to be really strong,\u201d he said on Monday, reaffirming his \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation on the stock and arguing the stock was oversold. \u201cYou are seeing a broadening in the demand portfolio into enterprise, even into sovereign states.\u201d\nBased on Hari\u2019s estimates for Nvidia\u2019s 2025 profits, Nvidia\u2019s price-to-earnings multiple is in the low 20s thanks to the sharp pullback over the past couple of weeks. By comparison, Tesla trades at 77 times next year\u2019s consensus earnings estimates, according to Yahoo Finance.\nNvidia has driven this year\u2019s gains in the S&P 500 index, but lately it has become a victim of its own success.\nA combination of\u00a0production bottlenecks\u00a0and a\u00a0lack of meaningful competition\u00a0means customers are waiting to be allocated supply of Nvidia\u2019s Hopper AI training chips. Those that are able to actually get their hands on this prized resource are paying through the nose, causing profit margins at Nvidia to balloon.\nUnhappy with the lack of choice, tech companies\u2014including Amazon and Tesla\u2014are developing their own custom silicon rather than depending entirely on Nvidia. These proprietary chips can be fabricated at specialized foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), bypassing Nvidia entirely.\nHari acknowledged barriers are dropping when it comes to the make-or-buy question, but argued the threat is overblown.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn0BQoiRjf0\nFor one, Nvidia H100s command a 90% share of the AI chip market versus rivals like AMD\u2019s MI300 series, so no one comes close to its technology. Those customers that are in the process of developing custom silicon are primarily interested in solving compute tasks unique to their businesses, Hari explained.\nWhile these would represent lost sales that would have otherwise gone to Nvidia, the proprietary chips would not be suited for competing with Nvidia directly on the open market.\nHari cited Google as an example, saying the company is working on its own AI chips to help improve Google Search. By comparison, the group\u2019s hyperscaler, Google Cloud Platform, showed no signs of a diminished appetite for Huang\u2019s chips.\n\u201cThey\u2019re still buying a boatload of Nvidia GPUs, and you can make the same case for Amazon,\u201d the Goldman Sachs analyst said. \u201cWithin merchant silicon, Nvidia is the go-to. And even versus custom silicon, they\u2019ve got the edge in terms of pace of innovation.\u201d\nAt the same time, Hari remained bearish on Intel, arguing CEO Pat Gelsinger has an uphill battle.\nNot only is Intel is\u00a0losing the race\u00a0with Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm on the product side, but its foundry business has no clear path to surpassing TSMC in terms of production technology.\nCompanies looking to outsource fabrication of their chips would not risk swapping out the Taiwanese giant for the inferior technology of Intel, argued Hari.\nHe rates Intel a \u201csell,\u201d but offered some advice to Gelsinger on how to at least put a floor under the stock in the near term:\n\u201cFor starters it would help for the company to start hitting what they guide to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve disappointed the market quite frequently, and that\u2019s never good for a stock price.\u201d\nNeither Nvidia nor Intel could immediately be reached by\u00a0Fortune\u00a0for comment.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic According to Financial Media.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks.\nOne of the primary growth drivers in the AI industry over the past few years has been the exponential increase in data generation. The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), social media, e-commerce, and various digital platforms has led to an unprecedented surge in data production. This vast amount of data serves as the fuel for AI systems, particularly in the development of machine learning models. Clive Humby, a venture capitalist, emphasized the critical role of data in AI development by famously proclaiming that data is the new oil. The ability to collect, process, and analyze large datasets allows AI algorithms to improve accuracy and deliver more sophisticated outputs.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nTo understand the AI revolution, it is also important to understand advancements in computing power. Moore\u2019s Law, which predicts the doubling of transistors on a microchip approximately every two years, has played a crucial role in enhancing the processing power available for AI applications - consider companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and their advanced node processing. The advent of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) - like the ones made popular by NVIDIA - has further accelerated AI development by enabling faster computation and more complex model training. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest hedge funds globally, says that these improvements in hardware have been a game-changer for AI.\nThe availability of massive investments in AI research and startups is also a key growth driver. According to a report by PwC, global investments in AI are expected to reach $15.7 trillion by 2030, with the technology contributing $6.6 trillion to GDP from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion from consumption effects. This influx of capital is spurring innovation and the commercialization of AI technologies across various sectors, from healthcare to finance. Prominent hedge fund managers are also taking note. Ken Griffin, the chief of Citadel Investment Group, says that AI is the most transformative technology of our time, and not just another bubble, but a structural shift in the economy.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have explosive growth potential according to financial news outlets.

Even though the company beat market expectations on earnings per share and revenue for the second fiscal quarter, the shares fell following the report. This was because there were concerns around the production ramp for the latest AI chips called Blackwell and a slowdown in data center growth during the second quarter, raising concerns about valuation and future volatility. This selloff happened despite the fact that the firm outlined $50 billion in share buybacks. However, market experts are forecasting a shift to robotics that could be a future growth driver for the tech giant as the AI boom fades away.\nWall Street analysts expect NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to register parabolic growth in the coming months. Truist recently raised the price target on the stock to $148 from $145 and kept a Buy rating, noting that investors should look through the Blackwell fog and recognize that the company beat revenue and EPS expectations for the quarter and in the outlook, while the results and commentary reinforced leadership in AI as strong and persistent.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks that could go parabolic according to financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: Nvidia vs. Intel",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Chip companies have been the primary beneficiaries of a recent artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The industry has exploded since November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an advanced chatbot made possible by high-performance chips like graphics processing units (GPUs).\nAs a leader in GPUs, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has massively profited from increased demand for the chips. As I write this, its stock has climbed 642% since the start of last year, alongside soaring earnings as it achieved a majority market share in AI GPUs. Nvidia could have a lot more to offer investors as the industry develops.\nHowever, there is also an argument to be made for investing in a less established AI chip stock like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which could have room to run. The company has had a challenging few years, with its share price down 60% since 2021. However, Intel is making moves that could secure a powerful role in AI over the long term.\nLet's examine these tech giants and determine whether Nvidia or Intel is the better stock to invest in the AI market.\nAt the start of 2023, Nvidia's market cap was $359 billion and it is now at just under $3 trillion. The company has enjoyed significant gains as its GPUs have become the go-to for AI developers worldwide.\nNvidia released its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings last week, with revenue increasing by 122% year over year. The period beat analysts' sales expectations by over $1 billion, while earnings per share outperformed by $0.04. Overall, it was an immensely positive quarter for Nvidia, which saw double- or triple-digit growth in each of its five segments. Its data center division, on its own, delivered revenue growth of 154% thanks to increased AI GPU sales.\nYet glowing quarterly results haven't done much to rally investors. Nvidia's stock has dropped since the earnings release on Aug. 28. Geopolitical concerns, economic uncertainty, doubts about Nvidia's valuation, and worry about delays in the launch of Nvidia's Blackwell processors have played a part in causing investors to withdraw. However, the company's nearly unrivaled dominance in AI and consistent earnings growth will likely make this dip temporary. Meanwhile, now could be an excellent opportunity to buy the stock at one of its best-valued positions in months.\nNvidia's free cash flow is up 167% over the last 12 months to $47 billion, massively outperforming its competitors. Nvidia has the brand power and financial resources to retain its dominance in AI and keep pushing its technology forward, making it one of the most reliable ways to invest in the industry.\nAfter years of declining earnings and market share in the chip industry, Intel is a little worse for wear. The company's quarterly revenue and operating income are down 33% and 119% over the past three years, with free cash flow tumbling 162%. As a result, Intel is planting seeds throughout tech in an effort to reinvent itself.\nIn AI, the chipmaker has revealed multiple new AI-enabled chips to better compete with Nvidia and AMD. Meanwhile, Intel has made a considerable push into manufacturing, hoping to eventually become the world's biggest AI chip fabricator. However, these ventures haven't come cheap, hurting Intel's financial position and profitability.\nIntel's stock popped 9% on Aug. 30 when a Bloomberg report said the company was in early discussions to potentially split its chip design and manufacturing divisions. The move could give both sides a better opportunity to thrive, with Intel's recent earnings indicating it may have bitten off more than it could chew.\nIntel was once a king in the chip market, with leading market shares in processors and manufacturing. However, it has struggled to keep up with competitors over the last decade. Recently announced chips have shown promising progress, and coming Ohio factories could lead to a lucrative role in AI chip production. However, it could take decades for Intel to deliver significant stock growth.\nNvidia and Intel are at wildly different stages of their journeys into AI. Nvidia has secured a spot at the top, with an estimated market share in AI GPUs of maybe up to 95%. Meanwhile, Intel has yet to see significant returns on its hefty investment in the industry. Intel may come back strong over the long term, but its future is too uncertain for me to recommend its stock.\nAlternatively, Nvidia has one of the most established positions in AI\u00a0 and the cash to continue thriving in the industry.\nMoreover, the chart below shows that despite Intel's plunging stock price in recent years, it still doesn't offer much value. Nvidia's lower forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) indicates its stock is trading at a better value than Intel's. Meanwhile, Nvidia's far higher free cash flow highlights the reliability of its business, making its stock a no-brainer way to invest in AI right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  George Budwell, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been on a tear. The company's shares have surged 145% year to date, dwarfing the S&P 500's gains. This otherworldly performance for a megacap stock extends beyond the short term. Nvidia's shares have skyrocketed 487% over the past three years and an astounding 2,740% over the past five years.\nDespite this astronomical rise, Nvidia's long-term valuation remains attractive. The stock trades at 28.5 times fiscal 2027 projected earnings, which isn't outlandish for a top-tier tech company. Still, investors have openly wondered whether Nvidia's outperformance can continue. Here are three compelling reasons the chipmaker's shares remain a top buy-and-hold candidate.\nNvidia has demonstrated a strong commitment to returning capital to shareholders. The company repurchased 62.8 million shares for $7 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 alone, according to its latest 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNvidia's board recently approved an additional $50 billion for share repurchases, bringing the total available to $53.9 billion as of Aug. 26. This substantial buyback authorization underscores management's confidence in Nvidia's long-term prospects.\nWhile its dividend program is usually an afterthought for most shareholders because of its 0.03% minuscule yield, the company did boost its quarterly cash dividend to $0.01 per share on a post-stock-split basis earlier this year. This increase, though small, underscores management's commitment to rewarding loyal shareholders.\nThese capital return initiatives demonstrate Nvidia's commitment to creating shareholder value. The combination of aggressive share repurchases and consistent dividend growth provides investors with multiple avenues for returns, setting Nvidia apart from many high-growth tech companies that forgo dividends entirely in favor of reinvesting in the business.\nNvidia is perfectly positioned to capitalize on the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for AI and machine learning applications. This dominance is reflected in Nvidia's data center revenue, which is experiencing explosive growth.\nIndustry experts predict that AI will have a transformative impact on the global economy. Consulting firm Accenture forecasts that AI could double annual global economic growth rates by 2035. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that global GDP may increase by up to 14%, or $15.7 trillion, by 2030 thanks to AI adoption.\nNvidia's technological leadership in AI hardware puts it at the forefront of this revolution. The company's GPUs are essential for training large language models and powering AI-driven applications across industries. As AI adoption accelerates, Nvidia stands to benefit from increased demand for its specialized hardware.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang envisions a future where \"millions of GPU data centers\" power AI interactions across the internet. This vision is rapidly becoming a reality. Major tech companies are dramatically increasing their GPU purchases, with Microsoft planning to triple its GPU supply to 1.8 million units this year.\nOther tech giants are following suit. Meta Platforms has announced orders for 150,000 H100 GPUs last year and 350,000 H100s or equivalents this year. Elon Musk's Tesla and X are also investing heavily in AI infrastructure, further ramping up demand.\nIndustry analysts project even more dramatic growth. Broadcom expects million-GPU clusters by 2027, compared with clusters with tens of thousands of GPUs today. Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su predicts the AI accelerator market will reach $400 billion by 2027.\nWith Nvidia's dominant market share, this could translate to a data center segment worth $320 billion for the company by 2027. To put this into context, Nvidia is on track to generate between $106 billion to $121 billion (a rough estimate) in data center revenue in fiscal 2025.\nNvidia's stock performance has been nothing short of extraordinary. The company's commitment to shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends demonstrates confidence in its long-term prospects. Most importantly, Nvidia's central role in the AI revolution positions it for continued growth.\nWhile past performance doesn't guarantee future results, Nvidia's technological leadership and strategic positioning make it a compelling choice for investors looking to capitalize on the AI megatrend. The company's ability to innovate and adapt to rapidly changing market demands will be crucial as it navigates the exciting but competitive landscape of AI.\nAs AI applications become more prevalent across industries, Nvidia's hardware is likely to play an increasingly vital role in powering these technologies. The company's strong financial position and focused strategy provide a solid foundation for future growth.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Oracle, which has an ongoing partnership with Nvidia, bumped up its revenue forecasts after beating earnings for the first quarter. The software firm also doubled its planned capital expenditures for the fiscal year \u2014 which are all bullish signs for Nvidia.\n\"All of these are great data points that, at least for the next 12 to 18 months, things look great,\" Chang said of the Jensen Huang-led firm.\nStill, he acknowledged some concerns investors have been airing. Some have floated worries that Nvidia's growth is unsustainable, given the stock's monster 2,514% gain over the last five years.\nSome analysts have warned demand for Nvidia's chips may not hold strong in the coming years, as the firm's largest customers could eventually turn into competitors. Apple and Microsoft, two huge customers of Nvidia's GPUs, are reportedly working on their own AI chips.\n\"Ultimately, if Oracle, if Microsoft, if Amazon don't see the ROI that they expect, they're going to cut orders. So hyperscale, demand volatility is something that really concerns us,\" Chang said. \"But, you know, these data center players have been known to order a bunch and then pause for several quarters. That's what we're looking out for.\"\nInvestors will also need to be on the lookout for tighter regulation of AI. Nvidia was recently targeted by the Department of Justice in a fresh antitrust probe, Bloomberg reported, and it's just a \"matter of time\" before other countries follow suit and try to regulate the technology, Chang said.\nNvidia stock sold off in the weeks following its earnings report at the end of August, but the stock staged a fresh rally this week alongside other tech stalwarts including Oracle and Super Micro Computer.\nWall Street remains generally bullish on Nvidia. According to Nasdaq data, analysts have issued an average price target of $153 a share, implying a 29% upside from current levels.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Right Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks.\nThis year has been a healthy year for the American stock market, fueled by a strong performance from technology stocks. Several indices capped their best week of the year in early September as stocks rose ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting where the central bank was expected to cut interest rates. NASDAQ has led the charge and registered a 20% growth during the first half.\nWhile the index lists over 3,100 companies from various sectors, the rally has been led by its top seven holdings which account for 52% of the index. All of them being tech stocks. There is a mix of optimism and skepticism among investors on whether NASDAQ will be able to continue its good run over the second half of the year. Historical data over the past decade shows that in most instances, NASDAQ has finished stronger during the back half of the year. There have only been two years between 2014 and 2023 during which NASDAQ\u2019s year-end returns were lower than first-half returns.\nHowever, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, told CNBC earlier this month that investors need to be cautious, as stocks could fall 10% during the next eight weeks amid interest rate cuts and the nervousness around the upcoming presidential elections. The co-founder of the research firm also suggested that if the dip is too strong, it should be viewed as a buying opportunity for investors. Lee has largely been on the money and nailed most stock calls this year.\nOther analysts also anticipate market volatility ahead of the presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider noted that stock activity lags between June and August while traders are on vacation. This results in strong market performance aided by thinner trade volumes. The activity jumps up significantly in September when they return to their desks, which often leads to stock price volatility. According to her, a two percent shift in share price in either direction has become the norm in September. However, during election years, the volatility is at its peak in mid-October instead of September, and the market returns to normalcy after the results are announced.\nLPL Financial's Adam Turnquist also expects seasonal shakiness in the months ahead, but pointed out, like Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes.\nBuying the September or October lows has been a very good trade. October, things start to improve, and then you have this November, December, year-end rally, typically very high average returns and high positivity rates for those months.\nBoth Turnquist and Young Thomas agreed that existing portfolios should not be readjusted because of seasonal volatility because it is short-term and hard to forecast.\nWith that said, let\u2019s head over to see some of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy right now, given the current trends and future projections.\nWe scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 to look for stocks listed on NASDAQ and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a software and fabless company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, that provides graphics computing and networking solutions. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now, with its share price having grown by over 2000% in the last five years, driven by strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPU) and AI models.\nIt remains the go-to company for cloud computing firms \u2013 including tech giants \u2013 looking to procure graphics processing units (GPUs) and semiconductors as they increase investments in artificial intelligence. This has been the catalyst behind NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s financial growth in the last few years.\nThe results continue to be strong. During Q2 FY25, the company generated a revenue of $30 billion, increasing 122% year-over-year, and 15% sequentially, fueled by surging demand for data center chips. It was well above the outlook of $28 billion. Net income for the quarter totaled $16.6 billion, resulting in EPS of $0.68, beating expectations of $0.645. For Q3, the company expects total revenue to be $32.5 billion, with gross margins between 74.4% to 75%. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also anticipates continued growth for Hopper Architecture and Blackwell products during the second half of the year.\nThere is consensus among Street analysts on the stock\u2019s Strong Buy rating, with its share price projected for a further 24% growth in the coming months. Investors also remain bullish on the stock. Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefited from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\nAccording to Insider Monkey, 179 hedge funds had a stake in the company as of Q2 2024.\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Nvidia: Buy, Sell, or Hold?",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced fiscal 2025 second-quarter results (for the three months ended July 28) on Aug. 28, and the stock has shed 18% of its value since then, despite delivering better-than-expected results along with guidance that exceeded consensus expectations.\nInvestors are probably worried about the fact that Nvidia forecast year-over-year revenue growth of 80% in the current quarter to $32.5 billion. While that's impressive, it is lower than the 122% growth it recorded in the previous quarter. Additionally, the growing concerns about the sustainability of massive investments in artificial intelligence (AI) technology seem to be giving Nvidia investors another reason to be skeptical about the stock's future.\nWith the stock having more than doubled in 2024, is now the time for Nvidia investors to start booking profits? Or should they continue holding the stock to wait for the bearish sentiment to get over? Or will it be a good idea to use the dip in Nvidia stock to buy more shares?\nNvidia has a solid moat in the markets it serves. For example, the company enjoys a healthy share of more than 80% in the AI chip market, and this has been central to its stunning growth in recent quarters. Nvidia's dominant position in AI chips is the reason why its data center revenue increased an impressive 154% year over year last quarter to a record $26.3 billion.\nThat number is way higher than the next prominent player in the market for AI accelerators -- Advanced Micro Devices -- which recorded $2.8 billion in data center revenue last quarter (including sales of server central processing units). AMD expects to end the year with more than $4.5 billion in revenue from sales of AI GPUs, which means Nvidia is leagues ahead of its closest rival in this market.\nThis moat explains why the pull of Nvidia's AI chips is so strong. Customers are still willing to purchase GPUs manufactured on the Hopper architecture, which was announced two and a half years ago, even though its next-generation Blackwell chips are set to enter production next quarter.\nNvidia has generated almost $49 billion in data center revenue in the first half of the current fiscal year, indicating that it could finish the year with almost $100 billion in revenue from this segment. John Vinh of KeyBanc estimates that Nvidia's data center revenue could jump to $200 billion next year thanks to the arrival of its Blackwell chips.\nWhile that looks like an ambitious forecast, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia indeed hitting that mark. The company's data center business is more than doubling each quarter, and it points out that the demand for its Blackwell chips will outpace supply, a trend that the chipmaker expects to continue in the next fiscal year as well.\nThrow in the fact that Nvidia's foundry partner is boosting capital expenditures and increasing its manufacturing capacity, and there is a good chance that the company could indeed enjoy a big data center boost in 2026 as well.\nConsensus estimates are projecting Nvidia's revenue to increase to $161 billion in fiscal 2026, but it could significantly exceed that mark if its data center business doubles once again. So there is a good chance that Nvidia's results in the upcoming quarters could be better than expectations. That could help the stock regain its mojo, which is why it would be a good idea to buy it while it is down.\nThe biggest factor that could keep investors from adding more Nvidia stock to their portfolios even after its pullback is its valuation. It is trading at an expensive 28 times sales, which is higher than the U.S. technology sector's average of 7.8. Additionally, the company's trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 50 is also higher than the sector average of 44.\nSo opportunistic investors may be waiting for Nvidia to become cheaper and would want to hold on to their current positions. Nvidia may get cheaper if the sell-off continues, but investors shouldn't miss the fact that this semiconductor stock is indeed cheap when we consider the pace at which it is growing. This is evident from the chart.\nThe stock's forward earnings multiples are much lower than its trailing multiples, pointing toward a nice bump in its revenue and earnings. Meanwhile, Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) -- which is a forward-looking valuation metric that takes into account a company's growth potential -- is significantly lower than 1. A PEG ratio of less than 1 means that a stock is undervalued considering the growth that it may deliver.\nThat's the reason why investors who are holding off from buying more Nvidia stock right now in anticipation of a more attractive valuation should not wait too long and consider acting before it starts heading higher.\nThe discussion so far suggests that Nvidia's recent sell-off doesn't seem justified, considering the potential growth it is likely to deliver on account of its strong position in the AI chip market, as well as the company's valuation that can't be called expensive based on its phenomenal growth.\nHowever, one reason why investors may want to sell Nvidia right now is if they want to get in on the stock at a lower price later on. Assuming someone sold some of their Nvidia holdings before the results were out, they would be able to buy more stock now, and that too at a more attractive valuation.\nWhile this does seem like a good strategy at first, timing the market isn't exactly a smart thing to do, as buying and holding on to solid companies over a long period is a tried-and-tested strategy of making money in the stock market.\nSo, there isn't exactly a strong reason to sell Nvidia right now. Moreover, the reason for investors to hold off from buying more Nvidia shares doesn't hold much water either. Investors would do well to buy Nvidia following its latest drop, as the bull case appears to be solid enough to warrant an investment.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Prediction: This 1 Thing Will Help Nvidia Stock Soar in the Fourth Quarter",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have roared higher over the past several years, thanks to the company's dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market -- it holds a more than 80% share. But recently, the stock has lost some of its momentum, falling more than 6% over the past month. Some investors have worried about growing competition in the chip market, and others fear that any slowdown in AI spending could hurt the company.\nIn my opinion, these concerns are overdone and Nvidia still has plenty of fuel in the tank to climb both in the near term and over time. My prediction is that one thing, in particular, will help Nvidia stock soar in the fourth quarter and the recent loss of momentum is only temporary. Let's dive into this tech story that still has plenty of exciting chapters ahead.\nJust a few years ago, this technology giant's biggest source of revenue was the gaming industry. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) powered all of the action, due to their ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. It soon became clear that this profile made the GPU perfect for other uses, including AI.\nNvidia turned its attention to this high-growth field, and its earnings took off, climbing in the triple digits quarter after quarter. Today, Nvidia's data center business -- the one that serves AI customers -- represents 87% of the company's total quarterly revenue. That's set to continue, considering the massive demand Nvidia's seeing and the general growth forecasts for the AI market, which is expected to expand from $200 billion today to more than $1 trillion by 2030.\nOf course, competitors do exist, but Nvidia is a step ahead when it comes to innovation. It also plans to update its GPUs on an annual basis, which should keep it in this top position. As for AI spending, my colleague Trevor Jennewine recently wrote about how spending on AI may gain more momentum over the coming years, representing great news for Nvidia.\nNow let's move on to my prediction. Yes, Nvidia shares have delivered a lackluster performance in recent weeks, but it's important to put that into perspective. The stock still has advanced 144% so far this year and has soared 2,700% over the past five years.\nMy prediction is that this is a pause in the action, and in the fourth quarter, sales of Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture will help the stock roar higher. Nvidia said during its most recent earnings call that it plans to ramp up production of Blackwell in the fourth quarter and will record \"several billion dollars\" of revenue from it during that period.\nNvidia won't report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings until early next year, but any communications from the company about the Blackwell release or talk in the market could happen much earlier -- and investors are known to react to any news. All of this may equal strong performance for Nvidia shares in the fourth quarter of this year as investors consider the company's message during the last earnings call -- and look ahead to Blackwell's contribution to the next fourth-quarter report.\nIt's important to remember that Nvidia Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang said demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply, and he expects this to continue into the coming year,\u00a0so it's clear that customers are rushing to get in on this new platform. I recently wrote about how two major technology players begged Huang for more GPUs, further illustrating how eager customers are to get Nvidia chips.\nAll this makes me confident about Nvidia's long-term revenue potential in the AI market and the potential for its shares to soar over time, as well -- whether my near-term prediction is right or not. That means Nvidia still is a great stock to buy and hold for the long haul.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "NVIDIA(NasdaqGS:NVDA) is navigating a dynamic period marked by both impressive growth and significant challenges. Recent highlights include record-breaking revenue growth driven by the Data Center segment and innovative product launches, counterbalanced by increased operating expenses and competitive pressures in China. In the discussion that follows, we will explore NVIDIA's core advantages, critical issues, growth opportunities, and key risks to provide a comprehensive overview of the company's current business situation.\nNavigate through the intricacies of NVIDIA with our comprehensive report here.\nNVIDIA has demonstrated exceptional financial health, with record-breaking revenue growth. In Q2, revenue reached $30 billion, marking a 15% sequential increase and a 122% year-on-year rise. This performance is largely driven by the Data Center segment, which reported $26.3 billion in revenue, up 16% sequentially and 154% year-on-year. Additionally, the company boasts high gross margins, with GAAP gross margins at 75.1% and non-GAAP gross margins at 75.7%. The strong demand for NVIDIA's products, particularly from frontier model makers and generative AI applications, further underscores its market leadership. Furthermore, innovative product launches like the NVIDIA H200 platform have bolstered its competitive edge, shipping to large CSPs, consumer Internet, and enterprise companies. NVIDIA's seasoned management team, with an average tenure of 15.7 years, has been instrumental in steering the company towards these impressive achievements.\nTo gain deeper insights into NVIDIA's historical performance, explore our detailed analysis of past performance.\nNVIDIA faces several challenges. The company's GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were down sequentially due to inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material and a higher mix of new products within the Data Center. Operating expenses also increased by 12% sequentially, primarily due to higher compensation-related costs. Additionally, the competitive market in China poses a significant risk, with Data Center revenue from China remaining below previous levels due to export controls. Furthermore, while NVIDIA is considered a good option compared to its peers with a Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 57.4x versus the peer average of 102.4x, it appears expensive relative to the US Semiconductor industry average of 26.9x. The stock is also trading above the estimated fair value of $94.06, suggesting potential overvaluation.\nTo dive deeper into how NVIDIA's valuation metrics are shaping its market position, check out our detailed analysis of NVIDIA's Valuation.\nNVIDIA has several promising opportunities to further enhance its market position. The expansion in sovereign AI, as countries recognize AI expertise and infrastructure as national imperatives, presents significant growth potential. The enterprise AI wave has also started, with enterprises driving sequential revenue growth in the quarter. NVIDIA plans to launch new Spectrum-X products annually to meet the growing demand for scaling compute clusters. Additionally, the demand for Blackwell platforms is expected to remain high, well above supply, into the next year. The company's strategic alliances, such as the collaboration with Salesforce to develop advanced AI capabilities for the enterprise, further strengthen its competitive advantage.\nSeveral external factors pose risks to NVIDIA's sustained success. The competitive market in China remains a significant challenge, with expectations of continued competitiveness. Economic factors impacting capital expenditures (CapEx) are also a concern, as debated by market analysts regarding the sustainability of CapEx investments by NVIDIA's customers. Regulatory issues are another potential threat, as the company must maintain compliance with evolving regulations to sustain its market leadership. Additionally, significant insider selling over the past three months raises concerns about potential internal challenges. These factors could impact NVIDIA's growth and market share in the long term.\nNVIDIA's impressive financial health and market leadership, driven by strong revenue growth and high gross margins, position it well for continued success, particularly in the Data Center and AI segments. However, challenges such as increased operating expenses, competitive pressures in China, and a higher Price-To-Earnings Ratio compared to the US Semiconductor industry average suggest potential headwinds. Despite these risks, NVIDIA's strategic initiatives, including its expansion into sovereign AI and enterprise AI, along with strong demand for its innovative products, offer substantial growth opportunities. Investors should weigh these factors carefully, considering the stock's current trading price relative to its estimated fair value and the broader industry context, to make informed decisions about the company's future performance.\nAlready own NVIDIA?

He said that investors should know when to take the chips off the table.\n\u201cThe idea that you should buy and hold through both the best of times and worst of times is probably incredibly foolish, with only very few exceptions,\u201d Cramer said.\nCramer said that if the stock you bought is going higher and higher and you keep resisting the urge to take some profits, you won\u2019t make any actual money from these gains if the stock comes down later paring all these profits. This seems straightforward but the idea of buying low and selling high is easier said than done, Cramer said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get carried away by the optimism. Instead, keep your head on straight, check your emotions, focus on long term and think about ringing the register, especially on stocks that might be getting too high,\u201d Cramer added.\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about. We also picked an interesting prediction Cramer made back in 2021 about a stock and saw how it turned out. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

I am being a pig in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) because this may be a $10 trillion stock.\u201d\nBack then, NVDA was trading at around $29 and today it\u2019s at $123.\nNvidia\u2019s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\nAt Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\nOf course, Nvidia won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs).

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Major Stocks to Invest In According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other best major stocks to invest in according to analysts.\nThe current economic landscape presents a mix of signals as market participants assess the necessity of additional interest rate cuts. Despite overall economic strength, the Fed has hinted at potential rate reductions due to weaknesses in specific sectors. Currency dynamics are also shifting, with the US dollar weakening against the euro, adding another layer of complexity to the market environment. Amidst this backdrop, major stock indices, including the Dow Jones, continue to hover near record highs.\nAs analysts and market participants navigate these developments, they must consider how these factors may influence investment strategies in the coming months. Recently, discussions have emerged regarding the implications of potential rate cuts and their effects on various sectors of the economy. Some experts argue that further cuts may be necessary to support smaller businesses and consumers who are still adjusting to previous interest rate hikes.\nStephanie Link, Chief Investment Strategist and Portfolio Manager at Hightower thinks that a soft landing for the economy despite market volatility is anticipated, which is a contrasting perspective amidst market volatility and uncertainty. While there are concerns regarding the performance of small-cap stocks and their ability to keep pace with larger assets, she thinks the economy may stabilize without entering a recession. We talked about this in more detail in our article on the\u00a010 Best Young Stocks To Buy Now, here\u2019s an excerpt from it:\n\u201c\u2026.She believes that the Fed is skillfully guiding the economy towards a soft landing, even amidst the expected market fluctuations before the elections.\nJohn Stoltzfus from Oppenheimer Asset Management joined CBNC\u2019s \u2018Squawk on the Street\u2019 on September 25 to discuss the difference the Fed\u2019s recent rate cut makes. It was highlighted that the S&P 500 is experiencing a remarkable moment, having just achieved its 41st record close of the year. Oppenheimer\u2019s Chief Investment Strategist has set a target of 5,900 for the index, attributing this optimistic outlook to the recent rate cuts by the Fed.\nStoltzfus explained that the significance of these cuts lies in their actual implementation after a long period of rate hikes and pauses. He described the rate cut as a down payment from the Fed to both Wall Street and Main Street, signaling that further cuts could be on the horizon if necessary. Since this announcement, the market has shown mixed reactions, with defensive stocks performing well at times while technology stocks have also seen gains.\nWhen discussing consumer discretionary stocks, Stoltzfus expressed that this sector is one of their favorites despite its underperformance earlier in the year. He noted that there has been a noticeable improvement in performance over recent months as investors recognize consumer resilience. However, he emphasized that within consumer discretionary, investors should focus on select companies rather than expecting a broad rally across the sector. Retailers leveraging e-commerce effectively are likely to perform better during the upcoming holiday season.\nThe conversation also touched on concerns regarding discounts in various sectors, particularly electronics. Stoltzfus acknowledged that value has become a key focus for consumers, which has led to increased competition among retailers. This competition allows consumers more options but may also pressure profit margins for some retailers. Nonetheless, he pointed out that many businesses within consumer discretionary, beyond just retail, are likely to maintain healthy margins.\nStoltzfus\u2019 discussion highlighted the positive impact of the Fed\u2019s rate cuts on market sentiment and consumer behavior while recognizing challenges in specific sectors. The outlook remains optimistic as investors navigate through these transitions and prepare for potential opportunities in consumer discretionary stocks and other sectors.\nMethodology\nWe used stock screeners to look for mega cap stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks with the highest upside potential (more than 15%), that were also the most popular among elite hedge funds, as of Q2 2024.

Companies are investing billions in AI and they expect to see the results of their investments in the coming months and years. Analysts at UBS said in a report earlier this year that if the launch of ChatGPT was the \u201ciPhone moment\u201d for the AI industry, apps like Copilot signify the \u201cApp Store moment.\u201d\nUBS also increased its revenue estimates for the AI industry in the report by 40%. The firm said at the time that it now expects revenue in the AI industry to increase from $28 billion in 2022 to $420 billion in 2027. This would represent a CAGR of over 70%.\nUBS justified its growth projections by drawing an analogy from the past growth cycles of mainframes, smartphones and PCs.\n\u201cAnnual shipments for mainframes were only about 1mn units until the 1980s, when they ballooned to around 10mn as microcomputers became mainstream computing devices. This was followed by a sharp increase during the PC era, when annual PC shipments shot up to more than 100mn units, with PC shipments eventually reaching an annual run-rate of nearly 300mn. Smart devices, which include smartphones and tablet PCs, crossed 1bn shipments during the mid2010s. Currently, annual shipments are close to 1.5bn units.

        "Title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Magic Formula Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks For The Rest Of 2024.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other magic formula stocks.\nOne of the best known investment strategies on Wall Street, and one that's also followed by investing greats the like of Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group is value investing. Another fund manager who has delivered fantastic returns through a value based approach is Joel Greenblatt. Greenblatt currently runs the hedge fund Gotham Asset Management, a fund that he set up in 2008 after moving forward from his previous fund called Gotham Capital.\nGreenblatt is among the fund managers that have consistently delivered double digit percentage returns during their career on Wall Street. His previous firm, Gotham Capital, had an amazing run between 1985 and 1994. During this time period, the firm delivered a net return of 34%. This was particularly impressive, as 1985 was the year in which Gotham Capital was founded. On an annualized basis, the fund's returns were even stronger, since during the same period, Greenblatt's fund delivered 50% in returns.\nThe hallmark of a value investing strategy, as you'll understand if you study Warren Buffett's investment strategy in detail, is patience. This also applies to Greenblatt, who typically waits for at least a couple of years after making an investment to reap the returns. But while patience might be a virtue, on Wall Street, it's the returns that matter. On this front, Greenblatt hasn't disappointed, as his fund's blazing run in the 1980s wasn't its only one. After setting up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, the value investor managed multiple funds. Two of these were the Gotham Absolute Return (AR) fund and the Gotham Neutral fund. Among these, the AR fund was set up in 2012, and between then and 2018, its returns sat at 58.6%.\nHowever, while these returns are impressive, this period was filled with ups and downs for the investment vehicle. For instance, 2013 was one of the best years for this fund as it posted 29.82% in returns. These gains were trimmed down to 9.31% in 2014. While these weren't as strong as the previous year's performance, they were nevertheless in the green. This is important since the next year wasn't great by any account, since in 2015, the AR fund ended up with -10.25%. 2016 was somewhat turbulent for American stock markets since the Brexit vote in the UK, slowing Chinese GDP growth, and a commodities slump led to US and global stocks dipping between the end of 2015 and the first half of 2016. Between June 2015 and late February 2016, the blue chip Dow index had lost roughly 9% and the broader NASDAQ had bled a much higher 11%.\nThe next year would see Greenblatt bounce back. In 2016, the fund delivered 7.97% in returns and accelerated its performance later on through posting 10.03% in gains. During these same years, i.e., in 2014, the Gotham Neutral fund's annualized returns had sat at 6.83%.\nSince the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019, the stock market has been operating in a changed environment. The pandemic's immediate aftermath saw major stock indexes crash by 30%+, which then led to the Federal Reserve reducing rates to near zero levels. The subsequent low cost of capital, the boom in demand for consumer technology products, and the rise in retail investing then saw markets soar. During this time period, i.e., the bottom in March 2020 and the peak of December 2021, Greenblatt's AR fund was up by 55% while the flagship S&P index gained 103%. This might make you think that perhaps the investor, who calls his investment approach a 'Magic Formula' had lost its magic.\nBut you'd be wrong. The magic of the Magic Formula was visible during the next phase of the stock market. This was marked by the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate tightening cycle that came in response to soaring inflation. Between December 2021 and October 2023, inflation continued to rise, as the interest rates took their sweet time to make a mark. This meant that the flagship S&P was down by 13.6% from 2021 close to the end of October 2023.\nHowever, during the same period, the AR fund had gained 3.41%. A short strategy had helped Greenblatt, it seems, as the AR fund advertises itself as being 50% to 60% net long. Gotham's pure play long fund, which is 100% long, led the S&P in losses during this time period as it had lost 15.52% during the same period and a stronger 27% from its peak in November start. However, the magic was visible between the March bottom and the November 2021 peak as during this period the 100% long fund had gained 97% to nearly match the flagship index.\nBefore we head to our list of the best Magic Formula Stocks, it's also important to take a brief look at what this investment technique entails. Greenblatt's strategy is based on two metrics, the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. In a simple implementation, stocks are ranked according to these metrics, and the top stocks are bought and held for the long term. A specialty implementation is what Gotham calls its Gotham Yield. According to the fund, this is a proprietary technique that assesses a firm's \"pre-tax cash flow, return on capital, and enterprise value.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy, we ranked the stocks present in Gotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 SEC filings by their dollar value and picked out the most valuable holdings.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 179\nGotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 Stake: $192 million\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the stock market's top stock when it comes to artificial intelligence. The firm's competitive moat is based on its GPU design, as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s chips are widely perceived to be the best of breed in the industry. This has led to an insatiable demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs, so much so that it has made the firm's revenue grow from $16.7 billion in 2021 to $79.7 billion on a trailing twelve month basis. This marks a 377% growth on an absolute basis, and during the same time period, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have appreciated by 299%, after having trimmed their gains since July. By July, the stock had appreciated by 339%, before NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shared its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Since its hypothesis depends solely on its GPUs, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is vulnerable to any inventory disruptions or gluts since it has few alternatives to rely on for revenue. At the same time, its technological strength means that any GPU alternatives from other firms can be hard to come by, making the world continue to be dependent on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) for the best GPUs.\nBaron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMore recently, however, we\u2019ve entered the period of doubts and questioning, some of which is real and normal in the first stages of a new paradigm, and some of which is prompted by short sellers. Given the explosive returns of NVIDIA and other AI leaders, AI bears and fear mongers have been comparing the current AI market winners with the internet bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, and NVIDIA\u2019s stock move today with Cisco\u2019s back then. First, while many stocks were trading at nosebleed valuations and on made up metrics (such as price per eyeballs) before the bursting of the internet bubble, as we\u2019ve said many times, the internet proved to transform our world and create the digital age we are now living in. Second, while NVIDIA\u2019s stock price inflection has been nothing short of unprecedented for a company of its size, it was fueled almost entirely by explosive growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows\u2013 not multiple expansion. Over the last 12 months, NVIDIA\u2019s stock has eectively tripled, but its forward P/E multiple has remained essentially flat, because NVIDIA blew away Wall Street expectations despite being covered by over 60 sell-side analysts, who have increased their forward projections every single quarter. In my career, the only comparative analogue is when Apple first introduced the iPhone and stunned Wall Street with its growth. In contrast, most of Cisco\u2019s move in the late 1990s was due to multiple expansion. At its peak, Cisco traded at a P/E ratio over 130 times, more than quadruple its five-year average of 37 times. At the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA traded at a P/E ratio of 40 times, equal to its five-year average, and at a P/E to growth (or PEG) ratio for 2025 of 0.8 times, as consensus expectations are for NVIDIA to grow earnings per share 40% next year.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Nvidia\u2019s share price has taken a knock, and its Chinese chipmaking rivals have soared, after Beijing reportedly discouraged Chinese AI companies from buying Nvidia\u2019s chips.\nBloomberg reported on Friday that Chinese regulators had issued guidance steering AI firms away from Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips. These aren\u2019t Nvidia\u2019s most cutting-edge AI chips, but they\u2019re the most powerful that the company can sell to China under U.S. export restrictions that aim to hold back China in the AI race.\nThe news immediately hit Nvidia\u2019s share price by 2.2%. In premarket trading on Monday, the AI chip leader was down by another 2%. Nvidia suppliers and contractors such as Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron, and TSMC were also down.\nThe falls were weighing on the markets more widely this morning, as Nvidia\u2014whose stock has more than doubled so far this year\u2014has an outsize role these days.\nBut the story was very different for the Chinese chip companies that were intended to be the beneficiaries of Beijing\u2019s guidance.\nShares in Cambricon and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), which are both partially owned by the Chinese state, soared by 20% on Monday, hitting the daily limit on the Shanghai exchange. Naura Technology Group, which produces chipmaking equipment, saw its stock pop by 9.8% in Shenzhen.\nYears of Western export controls have had some success in slowing the advance of China\u2019s AI efforts, denying Chinese companies the latest and greatest chips and, by holding back the most advanced production equipment, making it harder for Chinese chip companies to keep pace.\nProgress at Huawei, for example, was set back two years by the redesigns that were needed to produce its AI chips locally, and the performance of its recent Ascend 910B chips may be limited by production problems at contract manufacturer SMIC.\nOn Monday, Reuters reported multiple sources saying that TikTok parent ByteDance was planning to use the 910B chips to train an upcoming model. ByteDance reportedly already uses these chips for inference\u2014essentially, running AI models\u2014but using it for the more computationally demanding task of training would be another matter.\nByteDance denied that it was working on a new model. Nonetheless, if Reuters\u2019 report is accurate, it again points to the limits of what China\u2019s chip producers can currently achieve; one source told the newswire that Huawei was delivering the 910B chips too slowly for ByteDance\u2019s needs.\nHowever, the export controls have also pushed China\u2019s chip sector to adapt and work faster. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a major tech industry lobbying group, warned earlier this month that \u201cU.S. efforts to slow China down are unlikely to work in the long run.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) Colossus Nvidia Plummet 98%?",
        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "For the better part of two years, no trend has excited investors more on Wall Street than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe lure of AI is twofold. First, there's the ability for AI-driven software and systems to learn over time without human intervention. The capacity for software and systems to become more proficient at their tasks, or perhaps even learn new jobs/skill sets, gives this technology utility in almost every sector and industry around the globe.\nThe other reason investors can't seem to get enough of AI stocks is the eye-popping addressable market attached to this game-changing technology. According to the researchers at PwC, AI is forecast to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with these gains coming from a combination of consumption-side benefits and productivity improvements.\nWith a seemingly limitless ceiling for AI and an addressable market that dwarfs pretty much every other next-big-thing innovation for three decades, it's not a surprise to see investors flock to AI colossus Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Just be mindful that not everyone on Wall Street expects Nvidia to maintain its lofty valuation.\nWhen 2022 came to a close, Nvidia had a $360 billion market cap and was an important, but not critical, company in the tech sector. Less than 18 months later, it briefly became the largest publicly traded company in the world, with a peak market cap of $3.46 trillion.\nNvidia's historic gains are a reflection of the otherworldly demand for its H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) used in high-compute data centers. Based on estimates from the analysts at TechInsights, Nvidia has accounted for a roughly 98% share of the GPUs shipped to data centers in 2022 and 2023. In other words, its hardware is being relied on as the undisputed preferred choice for training large language models (LLMs) and running generative AI solutions.\nIn addition to its hardware being in high demand, Nvidia's CUDA software platform is doing its part to keep enterprises loyal to its ecosystem of products and services. CUDA is the toolkit developers use to build LLMs and maximize the computing capacity of their Nvidia GPUs.\nThere's also plenty of excitement surrounding future innovation. Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chip, which will be far more energy-efficient than its predecessor, is set for its debut in the coming months. CEO Jensen Huang also teased the release of his company's Rubin GPU architecture in 2026, which will run on a new processor, known as Vera. Investing in innovation makes it likely that Nvidia will maintain its No. 1 spot in terms of AI-GPU computing capacity.\nDespite this array of positives, big-time Nvidia bears do exist.\nPerhaps no Nvidia skeptic has been more vocal on Wall Street than financial writer and economist Harry Dent.\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital in June, Dent highlighted that the mammoth increase in money supply has set the U.S. economy and stock market up for disaster. He referred to the current market as the \"bubble of all bubbles,\" with Nvidia expected to be a victim of an upcoming crash. Dent pegged Nvidia's potential decline at 98%. Dent further opined,\nThis bubble has been going for 14 years. Instead of most bubbles [going] five to six, it's been stretched higher, longer. So you'd have to expect a bigger crash than we got in 2008 to '09.\nAs an Nvidia bear myself, I don't expect it to come anywhere close to a 98% downdraft.\nAlthough we have witnessed a couple of next-big-thing market leaders eventually plummet by 98%, including Canopy Growth following the hype in cannabis stocks, and 3D Systems, which has lost just shy of 98% of its value after 3D-printing buzz failed to materialize, a 98% peak-to-trough loss for a market leader is rare.\nFurthermore, Nvidia had other established sales channels in place prior to its AI revenue windfall. It's a leading provider of GPUs used in gaming and cryptocurrency mining, and should enjoy steady gains from its virtualization software segment. While these now-ancillary operations won't offset substantial weakness if the AI bubble were to burst, they'd almost certainly keep Nvidia from losing 98% of its value.\nBut even though a 98% decline isn't in the cards, a sizable drop that could extend beyond 75% is quite possible.\nAlthough Harry Dent's call for a 98% plunge in Nvidia may be out in left field, he did hit the nail right on the head when discussing history. While history doesn't repeat to a \"t\" on Wall Street, it does have a tendency to rhyme.\nSince the advent of the internet roughly three decades ago, every highly touted innovation, technology, and trend has worked its way through an early stage bubble-bursting event. Though the timing of when the music stops will differ in every instance, the end result is always the same -- market leaders getting pummeled.\nWithout fail, investors overestimate the utility and uptake of game-changing innovations and technologies. While artificial intelligence appears to have a bright long-term future, the fact that most businesses lack a well-defined game plan to profit in the near-term from their AI investments is a pretty clear indication that investor expectations are vastly outpacing real-world utility. In other words, it points to the formation of an AI bubble.\nThe vast majority of market-leading businesses for game-changing innovations over the last 30 years have shed 75% or more of their value on a peak-to-trough basis.\nThere are other potential concerns, too. For instance, insiders have been selling stock for 45 months without a single insider purchase. Though there are benign reasons for selling stock, such as for tax purposes, there's only one reason to purchase shares on the open market -- you think they'll increase in value. No insider has bought shares of Nvidia on the open market since Chief Financial Office Colette Kress in December 2020.\nIt's also logical to expect Nvidia's monopoly like AI-GPU market share to come under pressure in the quarters that lie ahead. The interesting thing is that internal competition might be even more worrisome than the AI-GPUs its rivals are bringing to market.\nNvidia's four largest customers by net sales are all internally developing AI-GPUs for use in their data centers. Even with Nvidia's chips having superior computing capacity, these four customers will likely be incented to utilize their own hardware over Nvidia's. This is a recipe for fewer orders in the future.\nAlthough a 98% decline is highly unlikely for Nvidia, a steep drop still appears very likely.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Since its IPO in January 1999, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has established itself as one of the world's most successful companies. It has been particularly adept at adapting its technology to expand into new markets.\nThe company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that revolutionized the gaming industry, turning boxy figures into lifelike images. The secret to its success was parallel processing, which allowed the chips to conduct a multitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously. Nvidia's processors are now used for product design, autonomous systems, cloud computing, data centers, artificial intelligence (AI), and more.\nThe ability to adapt its technology has been a boon to shareholders. Even if investors didn't get in on the IPO itself, Nvidia shares fell below their issue price numerous times in early 1999. For investors fortunate enough to get shares at (or below) the $12 IPO price, the stock has returned 493,940%.\nWhile a single share of stock might seem inconsequential at first glance, one share of the right stock can have a huge impact on an investor's success. In Nvidia's case, the company's performance and soaring stock price have resulted in numerous stock splits, turning one share into many more.\nHere's a list of Nvidia's stock splits over the years:\n2-for-1 split, June 27, 2000\n2-for-1 split, Sept. 12, 2001\n2-for-1 split, April 7, 2006\n3-for-2 split, Sept. 11, 2007\n4-for-1 split, July 20, 2021\n10-for-1 split, June 10, 2024\nAs a result of the multiple stock splits, an investor who bought just one share of Nvidia stock near its IPO in 1999 would now be the proud owner of 480 shares.\nHowever, it took a great deal of discipline and self-control to hold Nvidia for more than 25 years and reap this windfall. The stock has lost more than half its value on numerous occasions, which sent fair-weather investors scrambling for the exits.\nThat said, consider this: A $1,000 investment in Nvidia made in early 1999 would now be worth more than $4.9 million.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

For example, on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 228 points and the S&P 500 went up by 0.13%, the NASDAQ, which is heavily influenced by tech stocks, dropped by 0.52%. Cramer thinks it's because there isn\u2019t enough new money flowing into the market.\n\"How did we get to this bizarre dichotomy between tech stocks and pretty much everything else, where the two groups now almost always seem to move in opposite directions? Take today: the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 228 points, the S&P advanced 0.13%, but the NASDAQ\u2014with all that tech in it\u2014dropped a bomb. Yes, it fell 0.52%. How could there be such a schism?\"\nAs a result, large institutions need to move their investments between sectors since they can\u2019t invest in both at once. This shift is due to market mechanics rather than fundamental news. When stocks are already doing well, it\u2019s difficult to attract new investment, especially when safer options provide attractive returns. Therefore, either tech stocks or other sectors will perform well, but not both simultaneously.\n\"It\u2019s because there\u2019s not enough money coming in from the sidelines, so these big institutions have to swap out of one group if they want to buy stock in another. Yet this action has nothing to do with fundamentals; it\u2019s not about the news, it\u2019s about pure market mechanics. When stocks are already red hot, it\u2019s hard to attract new capital from the sidelines, especially when you can get a cozy 4% return for doing nothing. So, either tech wins or everything else wins, but there\u2019s not enough cash for both of them to win at the same time.\"\nCramer notes that this situation results in distinct winners and losers, rather than a range of performance on a positive day. This is occurring amid uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points in their upcoming meeting. Cramer also notes that, despite his usual reluctance to speculate on the Fed\u2019s decisions, recent market movements have been swayed by expectations of rate cuts. For example, when The Wall Street Journal indicated the Fed might choose a 50 basis point reduction, there was a notable shift towards cyclical stocks, particularly those related to housing. This shift, along with other positive news, contributed to the market's best week of the year.\n\"What happens? We get winners and losers\u2014not big winners and smaller winners, as you would normally expect on an up day like today. This is all against the backdrop of the big question: will the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points or 50 when it meets on Wednesday?\nThis leads me to this newfound great divide between tech and non-tech, because that\u2019s how this market seems to be trading. It\u2019s a big reason why I\u2019m out here in Silicon Valley this week. Today, we saw a market that doesn\u2019t believe in AI, or tech in general for that matter. It\u2019s a market that believes a 50-basis-point rate cut will shift money from semiconductors to housing and anything housing-related, and people want to get ahead of that.\"\nJim Cramer noted that Monday\u2019s market saw a wide range of winners. Healthcare stocks, retailers, and consumer packaged goods companies all did well, and even oil stocks, which have been lagging, are rebounding. This is unusual because typically when cyclical stocks rise, sectors like healthcare and consumer products would drop. Cramer explains this trend as part of a broader market shift he calls \"ABT,\" or \"anything but tech.\" Essentially, today's market is focusing on sectors outside of technology.\n\"Today, the winners broadened out. The healthcare stocks got jiggy, retailers worked, and consumer packaged goods companies outperformed. Even the much-maligned oils are rallying. It\u2019s crazy\u2014healthcare and consumer products should be selling off when cyclicals rally, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening because it\u2019s *ABT*. No, I\u2019m not talking about the symbol for Abbott Labs. ABT means \u201canything but tech,\u201d and that\u2019s what today\u2019s market was about.\nThe implications are pretty stark, folks. Market commentators call this a rotation, but that understates what\u2019s really happening here because the move is so vicious and devoid of realism. The market\u2019s action is dictating what we do. For example, we know that the principal beneficiaries of rate cuts are the housing stocks, which rallied again today. This is the second day these stocks jumped as rates continue to plummet. But today, day two, was zero-sum.\"\nTech stocks also experienced notable gains because of key events. For example, Larry Ellison from Oracle reported strong earnings and emphasized the need for many additional data centers.\nOur Methodology\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Mad Money episode, where he discussed various stocks. We have selected the ten most notable companies he mentioned and ranked them based on their ownership levels by hedge funds, from the least owned to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nJim Cramer noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stock has been struggling since its last earnings report, even though the company is performing well. He pointed out that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), like other tech stocks, is currently contributing to market losses.\n\"And yes, Nvidia\u2014that stock is still struggling since its last earnings report. Nvidia is doing better than ever, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Nvidia, like the rest of tech, is just a share donor to the rest of the market.\"\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a strong investment choice due to its dominant position in the AI and GPU markets. In fiscal Q2 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported an extraordinary 111% increase in revenue and a 137% rise in EPS compared to the previous year, far surpassing expectations.\nThis growth is driven by high demand for AI chips like the H100, key partnerships with major tech companies such as\nMeta Platforms, Inc.\n(NASDAQ:META) and OpenAI, and continued investments in AI infrastructure. Analysts are optimistic about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s future, predicting a 33% potential price increase thanks to its strong market position and growth potential.\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of Jim Cramer's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Between a steady stream of economic data releases and thousands of companies lifting the hood on their operating results every three months, it can be easy for investors to miss an important announcement. Last month, one of the most-critical announcements of the quarter likely went under the radar for some investors.\nOn Aug. 14, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management were required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F gives investors a concise snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's brightest investment minds purchased and sold in the latest quarter.\nEven though this information can be up to 45 days old when filed, 13Fs still offer valuable clues about which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends are piquing the interest of top money managers -- including billionaire investors.\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of the June-ended quarter is that, while artificial intelligence (AI) is still a popular trend, billionaires weren't shy about parting ways with shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). But while Nvidia was shown to the door, 13Fs make clear that billionaire investors were seemingly infatuated with two other hypergrowth stocks.\nThe June-ended quarter marked the third consecutive quarter that at least seven prominent billionaire asset managers were sellers of Nvidia stock. The latest round of sellers included (total shares sold in parenthesis):\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (9,282,018 shares)\nDavid Tepper of Appaloosa (3,730,000 shares)\nStanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (1,545,370 shares)\nCliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,360,215 shares)\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (676,242 shares)\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (409,042 shares)\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (96,963 shares)\nConsidering that Nvidia's shares have gained 603% since 2023 began, through the closing bell on Sept. 6, profit-taking is a valid reason that likely explains some of this selling activity. But there's more to this story than just billionaires cashing in their chips for tax or diversification purposes.\nTo start with, investor expectations for the AI revolution are probably too lofty. For 30 years, every highly touted innovation and technology has endured a bubble-bursting event early in its existence. This has been a reflection of investors consistently overestimating the uptake of new technologies/innovations by consumers and businesses. Since most companies lack a clearly defined plan for how they'll monetize AI, it's looking likely that artificial intelligence is simply the next in a long line of hyped bubbles.\nRapidly growing external and internal competition represents another reason for billionaire investors to fade Nvidia.\nDespite Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) having clear computing advantages over external competitors, the company's extensive chip backlog, coupled with the considerably cheaper price point for non-Nvidia AI-GPUs, is liable to coerce at least some businesses to turn to its competitors.\nWhat's more, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales, which are all members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" are internally developing AI-GPUs that'll be used in their data centers. The writing is on the wall that Nvidia's chips are going to miss out on valuable data center real estate moving forward.\nBut while billionaire money managers were busy dumping shares of Nvidia in the second quarter, they were actively piling into the following two supercharged growth stocks.\nThe first high-octane growth stock that billionaire investors were drawn to in the June-ended quarter is e-commerce leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Form 13F filings show that five top-tier billionaire investors were buyers, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,391,262 shares)\nRay Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,597,676 shares)\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (1,214,055 shares)\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,114,948 shares)\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (702,235 shares)\nAlthough most people are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace, this operating segment isn't why these five billionaires purchased shares of Amazon during the second quarter.\nThe primary lure for Amazon as an investment is its globally leading cloud infrastructure service platform. Tech analysis firm Canalys pegged Amazon Web Services (AWS) worldwide market share at 33%, as of June 2024. AWS has a sustained double-digit growth rate, is pacing more than $105 billion in annual run-rate sales, and is consistently responsible for between 50% and 100% of Amazon's operating income.\nAWS is also Amazon's vessel to take advantage of the rise of AI. The company plans to deploy generative AI solutions to help AWS clients improve their business and better reach consumers. The enterprise cloud and AI revolution are still in their early innings, which bodes exceptionally well for AWS' future.\nBut there's more to Amazon than just AWS and its e-commerce platform. Amazon is drawing more than 3 billion visits each month, which makes it a magnet for businesses wanting to advertise. Advertising services revenue has grown by at least 20% on a year-over-year basis for two years.\nFurthermore, its growing content library and exclusive sports partnerships -- an 11-year streaming rights deal with the NBA and the streaming rights for Thursday Night Football -- should afford the company exceptional pricing power with its Prime subscription.\nThe second hypergrowth stock that billionaires appear to be infatuated with in lieu of Nvidia is China-based electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nio (NYSE: NIO). In spite of its diminutive nominal share price, which hovered around $5 for much of the second quarter, a half-dozen billionaires piled in, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (4,018,659 shares)\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,484,185 shares)\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (626,300 shares)\nJohn Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (395,000 shares)\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (30,868 shares)\nOn one hand, we've certainly witnessed a cooling in EV demand throughout 2024. Competition has picked up in the EV arena, and consumers have been a bit leery to take the plunge given the lack of available EV charging infrastructure. But in spite of these challenges, we've witnessed meaningful sales growth and a sizable production ramp from Nio.\nSince China lifted its cumbersome COVID-19 mitigation measures in December 2022, Nio has enjoyed a fairly steady production expansion. The absence of supply chain constraints has allowed the company to produce around 20,000 EVs per month. Through August, deliveries were up nearly 36% from the comparable period in 2023.\nNio also wins with its innovation. It's been introducing at least one new EV annually for years, and has taken advantage of an increase in demand since rolling out its NT 2.0 platform, which incorporates an assortment of new driver assistance features.\nTo add, Nio introduced its ONVO brand to the world in May. Whereas Nio has traditionally focused on premium EVs, the ONVO brand is more family oriented and will provide a potentially more palatable price point for Chinese consumers.\nLastly, the efforts of management to keep costs under control while improving margins are beginning to pay off. Vehicle margin jumped six percentage points in the June-ended quarter to 12.2% from the prior-year period, while adjusted net loss shrank close to 17%. Though Nio still has a lot of work to do to reach profitability, it's taking steps in the right direction.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Chip Stocks Powering AI Boom. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks.\nAI has played a pivotal role in driving growth within the semiconductor market, transforming it into one of the most lucrative sectors globally. As AI applications proliferate across industries \u2014 from cloud computing and autonomous vehicles to healthcare \u2014 demand for advanced semiconductor technologies has surged. NVIDIA, a leader in AI GPUs, reported record revenues exceeding $30 billion in Q2 2024, largely driven by AI-related chip sales. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the chipmaker, remarked that AI was the most powerful technology force of the time and was transforming industries across the board.\nAI demands massive data processing capabilities, which in turn requires highly specialized semiconductors like GPUs, TPUs, and AI accelerators. Experts highlight that 75% of AI workloads rely on advanced chips designed specifically for machine learning and deep learning tasks. Research firm Gartner predicts that 70% of all new AI applications by 2025 will require hardware accelerators, primarily in data centers and edge computing environments, underscoring the critical role of AI in the semiconductor ecosystem. As AI models become more complex, they require exponentially larger memory and storage solutions.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nAI models like GPT-4 by OpenAI and PaLM by Google have billions of parameters, and memory-intensive High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips are crucial for training and inference. This has led to a significant increase in the production of memory chips, with AI-related demand accounting for a large portion of the $500 billion semiconductor industry\u200b. AI-focused startups and established companies alike are benefiting from this growth. For instance, the AMD acquisition of Xilinx in 2022 was aimed at enhancing AI capabilities, resulting in a major competitive advantage in AI chips.\nHowever, the rosy picture has been dented in recent weeks on the back of a major selloff in the tech sector and increased volatility in the semiconductor space. Robert Maire, the chief of Semiconductor Advisors, a prominent financial consulting firm, recently appeared on news platform CNBC to discuss the market volatility in the chip sector, highlighting factors like earnings not being enough to keep stocks at inflated values and the threat of possible Chinese oversupply in trailing edge semiconductors. Maire said that AI has been the only driver of growth in the semi market, leading to a situation where investors got ahead of themselves.\nMaire highlighted during his appearance that China was still lagging behind the US and Europe in the leading-edge AI space, as it had been deprived of tools needed to keep pace with change in this market. However, the chip advisor claimed that Chinese firms have caught up in the trailing edge AI space, citing examples of Chinese firms like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation and Hua Hong Semiconductor Limited already exceeding US-based firms like UMC and GlobalFoundries in capability. He cautioned that despite progress, Chinese firms were still not doing enough to challenge US-based leaders in the trailing edge space.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected companies that operate in the semiconductor sector and have exposure to the AI industry.

Latest reports reveal that AI startup CoreWeave is considering a share sale ahead of an expected IPO. The startup is based in New Jersey and provides cloud access to AI GPUs for training large language models, inference and high-performance computing applications. Per reports, the startup, backed by companies like NVIDIA, will allow employees to sell shares worth $500 million, putting the valuation of the firm at around $23 billion. Last year, the startup was valued at around $7 billion. In May this year, it was valued at $19 billion.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the top sector pick of Bank of America. The advisory has a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $165. In a recent investor note, the investment advisor acknowledged that the firm faced several near-term headwinds that could suppress the stock, including fundamental ones like the Blackwell delay and gross margin pressure.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has led the AI stock boom since the launch of ChatGPT, but there are now legitimate questions about whether that rally still has steam.\nAfter the company reported earnings on Aug. 28, the stock fell even though it beat analyst expectations, a sign perhaps that Nvidia's valuation had outrun the growth in its business. Last week, the stock tumbled again, first on a report that Nvidia later denied that the company was being subpoenaed by the Department of Justice. Then, the stock fell another 4% on Friday in response to a weak employment report.\nAs a result, the stock was down more than 18% from before it released its fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings report. Sentiment on the stock might be down, but the sell-off is starting to look like an excellent buying opportunity. Here's why.\nNvidia is significantly cheaper than it was a couple of weeks ago, but the stock is still expensive according to traditional metrics, trading at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 49.5.\nHowever, Nvidia is still growing at a blistering pace with adjusted earnings per share more than doubling in the second quarter and expected to double again in the third quarter.\nThe analyst consensus currently calls for the company to generate adjusted EPS of $2.84 this year, equal to a forward P/E of 36, on par with its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers like Apple and Microsoft.\nAnalysts have also consistently underestimated Nvidia's earnings growth so it seems likely that the company will top that forecast.\nLooking ahead to next year, Nvidia also seems well positioned for continued growth as it's planning to ramp up its Blackwell platform in the fourth quarter and expects that growth to continue into 2025.\nNvidia stock is down 18% in just six sessions, but if you take a closer look at the news during that period, nothing really seems to warrant that kind of decline.\nNvidia stock fell 6.4% after the report, seemingly because guidance wasn't as strong as some investors hoped and its gross margin fell sequentially. However, the quarter was still strong overall and beat analyst estimates.\nThe following week, the stock fell 9% on Tuesday. There was no real news out on the stock during the day, but after hours Bloomberg reported that Nvidia was being subpoenaed by the Department of Justice. Rumors of that report seemed to have triggered the sell-off. However, Nvidia later said it hadn't received any communication from the DOJ.\nFinally, the slide on Friday also seems misunderstood. Nvidia operates in a cyclical sector, but the momentum in generative AI is much stronger than an ordinarily cyclical expansion, and even with weak job growth in August, the unemployment rate is still low at 4.2%. The panic over a disappointing jobs report, which pushed the Nasdaq Composite down 2.6% on Friday, seems overdone.\nFinally, Friday's sell-off and the stock's more general volatility on macro news indicate that investors think its momentum could be easily undone.\nHowever, Nvidia dominates the market for data center GPUs, the components used to run generative AI models, and demand for those chips won't be easily undone.\nBig tech companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla have all asserted the importance of building their AI infrastructure, calling it a top priority, and insisting that the consequences of underinvesting in the new technology are much greater than overinvesting in it.\nThese \"Magnificent Seven\" companies have tens of billions of dollars to put to use in AI infrastructure, and minor economic headwinds aren't going to dissuade them from doing so. Even a minor recession seems unlikely to deter the trajectory of AI spending.\nThat should reassure investors that Nvidia can maintain its strong growth rate even if the economy slows.\nWith the stock price down for mostly unjustified reasons, that's yet another reason to take advantage of the sell-off and buy the dip in Nvidia.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other unstoppable AI stocks.\nGenerative AI is taking the world by storm. This groundbreaking technology is capable of creating new content, such as text, images, and even music, based on the patterns it learns from existing data. The impact of this advancement in AI on businesses has been profound, with businesses using it to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and generate innovative solutions through personalized content.\nWhile there are still challenges, GenAI's potential is undeniable. AI companies have rolled out GenAI platforms, integrating large language models in them, that are a click away from the general public's access. We talked about this earlier in our article about the 10 Best Small Cap AI Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers. Here's an excerpt from it:\n\u201cLarge language models are a type of AI that uses deep learning techniques and massive datasets to understand, generate, and predict human language. They\u2019re trained for all of this through statistical relationships from vast amounts of text. The reason why they became so popular in such a short time is because they can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or understand language better through specific prompts. LLMs like Gemini and ChatGPT-4 are Multimodal AI platforms that allow processing and generating multiple types of data simultaneously, such as text, audio, and visual inputs.\u201d\nGenAI has been popular recently due to advancements that have brought us models like ChatGPT-4, but predictive AI (or enterprise machine learning) has been prevalent in the business world for a longer period. It's been used extensively for tasks like fraud detection, customer churn prediction, and market analysis. GenAI excels at creating new content, but predictive AI is better suited for tasks that involve forecasting future trends or predicting outcomes based on historical data.\nMature organizations with streamlined processes use predictive AI as it helps deliver high returns and improve the customer experience. Forbes reported that UPS saves $35 million annually by optimizing package delivery planning. A medium-sized bank could save $16 million annually by predicting fraudulent transactions. A marketing campaign could increase profit 5x by predicting consumer behavior.\nGenAI spending was less than 7% of predictive AI last year. However, predictive AI's potential remains largely untapped due to challenges in operationalization. It can operate autonomously, while GenAI often requires human oversight. It is also cheaper and has a smaller footprint than the latter. The global predictive AI market is expected to grow from $14.9 billion in 2023 to $108 billion by 2033, with a CAGR of 21.9% from 2024 to 2033, according to a report published by market.us.\nGoogle AI's investment of $100 billion in responsible AI initiatives, focusing on areas like healthcare, climate change, and cybersecurity, indicates this sector's importance and potential. Similarly, SoftBank's $3.5 billion fund for predictive AI startups and Sequoia Capital's substantial investment in PreCog are also examples of this. In 2023, the Large Enterprises segment captured more than a 65% share in the Predictive AI market.\nPredictive AI is used for large-scale operations, learning from data to predict outcomes and behaviors, and guiding millions of daily operational decisions. Such use cases are further a testament to how artificial intelligence is now an integral part of major industries of the world, whether directly or indirectly.\nMethodology\nTo compile our list, we sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of 15 AI stocks. We then selected the 7 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and had gained at least 30% year to date.

        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged higher on Tuesday, jumping as much as 4.8%. As of 3:20 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 4%.\nThe catalyst that sent the chipmaker and artificial intelligence (AI) specialist higher were reports that the company's chief executive was done selling stock for now.\nCEO Jensen Huang has sold a large block of Nvidia stock in recent months, a move that caught the attention of investors. In all, he sold roughly 6 million shares worth roughly $713 million as part of a prearranged stock trading plan put in place earlier this year.\nThe sales were made pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan, which allows insiders to sell stock in the future according to a predetermined schedule without running afoul of insider trading rules. In more than four dozen transactions over the past three months, Huang divested 6 million shares, reaching the limit set up in the prearranged plan, suggesting the chief executive was done selling Nvidia stock -- at least for now.\nSome investors tend to get nervous when insiders sell stock, particularly in large quantities. Rumors that \"they know something we don't\" or \"the stock has peaked\" tend to make the rounds.\nHowever, there are plenty of reasons to sell stock, especially if it makes up a large part of an executive's compensation package. That's certainly the case with Huang, as 96% of his total pay is stock options tied to Nvidia's overall stock performance. As a result, and in order to reap the rewards of successfully navigating the stock to new heights, Huang and other executives must sell stock, so there's nothing concerning or nefarious about these sales.\nFurthermore, Huang is still the largest individual holder of Nvidia stock. According to the company's most recent proxy statement, Huang controlled more than 93 million shares, or more than 3.75% of the outstanding stock. This alone suggests that Huang is still confident in Nvidia's future prospects.\nIn short: Nothing to see here, folks.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of the 7 Best Revenue Growth Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other best revenue growth stocks to buy according to analysts.\nThe Fed recently cut the funds rate by 50 basis points which has been considered a bold move by some analysts while others and most of the market have welcomed it with open arms. Moreover, over 50% of interest rate traders expect another 50 bps cut in the next meeting as well, according to the CME Fed-watch tool.\nWhile the Fed\u2019s move might seem risky, the broader market is up over 2.5% since the cuts, as of September 27.\nIn an interview with CNBC Squawk Box on September 19, Professor Jeremy Siegel of the Wharton School expressed his strong approval of the Fed\u2019s decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. He called it the best news from the Fed in years.\nProfessor Siegel believes that this move will lead to a significant rise in the stock market and pointed out that the Fed is now addressing the gap between current rates and what he considers the \u201cnew neutral\u201d Fed funds rate of 2.9%.\nHe said that the Fed has shifted from expecting only one rate cut by the year\u2019s end to anticipating four cuts in total, with the market reflecting expectations of a gradual approach to future cuts.\nWhen asked about concerns from former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson, who warned that the market might be overreacting to the cuts, Siegel said that smaller, consistent rate decreases would be enough.\nHe suggested that if inflation remains low, the Fed could implement 25 basis point cuts in the upcoming meetings, ultimately reducing rates to around 3.3% to 3.5%. He said with confidence that inflation would not rise significantly, as he referenced the market indicators suggesting it could fall below 2% next year.\nIn a discussion about economic policies from the presidential candidates, Professor Siegel critiqued both sides as extreme and said that their policies are unlikely to be implemented. He said that there would be a divided government that would limit any drastic changes. He stressed that while some policies might be proposed, actual governance would lead to compromises rather than sweeping reforms.\nAccording to data from Ned Davis Research, historical trends indicate that stocks tend to perform favorably in the year following the initial interest rate cut. According to the data, the broader market has recorded an average increase of around 12% in the first six months and 15% in the first twelve.\nDespite the generally positive outlook for stocks following interest rate cuts, there were exceptions in 2001 and 2007, when the broader market saw declines of 12.4% and 22.2%, respectively, in the year following the Fed\u2019s actions. This shows that historical average performance does not guarantee that rate cuts will always yield favorable outcomes.\nHowever, looking at the last ten rate cut cycles since 1974, the market has risen in eight of those instances, with four cycles resulting in gains of over 20%. Additionally, after the 1974 cut cycle, the market reached a remarkable 40% increase.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used stock screeners to compile a list of over 30 stocks with 5-year revenue compound annual growth rate of 30% or above. Next, we narrowed our list to 7 stocks most favored by analysts. The 7 best revenue growth stocks are listed in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside as of September 27.\nWe also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) One of the Best Revenue Growth Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?\nAverage Price Target Upside: 23.56%\n5-Year Revenue CAGR: 56.73%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in graphics, computing, and networking solutions. Established in 1993, the company initially carved out a niche with its pioneering graphics processing units (GPUs), which excel at handling multiple tasks simultaneously.\nThe innovation has made it a critical player not only in the gaming industry but also in sectors such as professional visualization, data centers, and automotive markets. The company operates through two main segments, Graphics and Compute & Networking.\nThe Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs and the GeForce NOW game streaming service, while the Compute & Networking segment features data center platforms and advanced AI software.\nIts stock has received a consensus Strong Buy rating from 64 analysts. As of September 27, the average price target of $150.00 has an upside of 23.56% from current levels. It ranks 5th on our list of the best revenue growth stocks to buy according to analysts.\nIn 2023, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) captured an impressive 94% market share in AI server sales as per Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh\u2019s estimates, which reinforces its dominance in the rapidly growing AI GPU market.\nThe company\u2019s data center revenue has surged at a rate significantly outpacing that of competitors, which show a strong demand for its products. Customers are actively seeking NVIDIA\u2019s Hopper AI GPUs, which are expected to be succeeded by the next-generation Blackwell chips. The demand for these upcoming processors is projected to surpass supply through 2025, which is a sign of a strong pipeline for future revenue.\nOverall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best revenue growth stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "By Noel Randewich and Suzanne McGee\n(Reuters) -Shares of AI heavyweight Nvidia tumbled 9.5% on Tuesday in the deepest ever single-day decline in market value for a U.S. company, as investors softened their optimism about artificial intelligence in a broad market selloff following tepid economic data.\nNvidia lost $279 billion in market capitalization, a major indication that investors are becoming more cautious about emerging AI technology that has fueled much of this year's stock market gains.\nThe PHLX chip index plummeted 7.75%, its biggest one-day drop since 2020.\nThe latest jitters about AI come after Nvidia last Wednesday gave a quarterly forecast that failed to meet the lofty expectations of investors who have driven a dizzying rally in its stock.\n\"Such a massive amount of money has gone to tech and semiconductors in the last 12 months that the trade is completely skewed,\" said Todd Sohn, an ETF strategist at Strategas Securities.\nIntel dropped nearly 9% after Reuters reported CEO Pat Gelsinger and key executives are expected to present a plan to the company\u2019s board of directors to slice off unnecessary businesses and revamp capital spending at the struggling chipmaker.\nWorries about slow payoffs from hefty AI investments have dogged Wall Street's most valuable companies in recent weeks, with shares of Microsoft and Alphabet trading lower following their quarterly reports in July.\n\"Some recent research has questioned if the revenues from AI alone will eventually justify this wave of capital spending on it. When assessing AI capex by individual companies, investors must consider if they are making the best use of their balance sheets and capital,\" BlackRock strategists wrote in a client note on Tuesday.\nAt its July record high close, Nvidia had almost tripled in 2024. Its recent losses leave it up 118% year to date.\nTuesday's weakness in chip stocks accompanied wide declines on Wall Street, with the Nasdaq dropping 3.3% and the S&P 500 down 2.1%.\nInvestors mostly expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in its Sept. 18 policy announcement, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.\nHowever, minority expectations of a 50 basis point cut rose to 37% from 30% after data on Tuesday signaled activity in the manufacturing sector remains soft.\nInvestors will get a host of data on the labor market this week, culminating in Friday's key government payrolls report.\n\"There\u2019s concern about what the job numbers are going to show, about seasonality,\" warned Steve Sosnick, a market strategist at Interactive Brokers.\nThe chip index is now up 14% in 2024, just under the S&P 500's 16% gain.\nNvidia's record one-session loss in stock market value was greater than the $232 billion decline suffered by Facebook-owner Meta Platforms on Feb. 3, 2022, when the social media company issued a dismal forecast, according to LSEG data.\nFollowing Nvidia's quarterly report last week, the mean analyst estimate for annual net income through January 2025 has climbed to $70.35 billion from about $68 billion ahead of last week's report.\nThose increased earnings estimates, combined with Nvidia's share losses, have the chipmaker now trading at 34 times expected earnings, down from over 40 in June and in line with its two-year average.\nBroadcom, another chipmaker that has benefited from the boom in AI computing, fell 6.2% ahead of its quarterly report on Thursday.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Bill Berkrot)\n"

        "Title": "Amazon Sent a Big Warning to Nvidia Shareholders. Is the AI Stock in Trouble?",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have surged 145% over the past year due to the semiconductor company's critical position in the artificial intelligence (AI) economy. Specifically, Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUS) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like training machine learning models and running artificial intelligence applications.\nEarlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported, \"Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%.\" Some analysts believe Nvidia controls as much as 95% of the AI chip market. But Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) recently issued a warning for Nvidia shareholders.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told analysts no single artificial intelligence chip will fit every use case, simply because companies and developers want optionality. \"You saw this several years ago when some companies tried to argue that TensorFlow will be the only machine learning framework that mattered, and then PyTorch and others overtook it,\" Jassy explained.\nNvidia consistently sets performance records at the MLPerf benchmarks, objective tests that measure how well AI systems perform training and inference tasks. But Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are also very expensive. Its H200 GPUs cost up to $40,000 each, and full server racks cost millions of dollars. Jassy believes there is robust demand for products between the two extremes, so Amazon is developing custom AI silicon.\n\"We have a deep partnership with Nvidia and the broadest selection of Nvidia instances available, but we've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance,\" Jassy told analysts. \"It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon. Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference.\"\nImportantly, Amazon has previous experience in developing custom chips. The company has been designing generalized central processing units (CPUs) called Graviton processors for several years. Those chips are based on Arm architecture, and they offer 30% to 40% better price performance versus the leading x86 processors from AMD and Intel, according to Jassy.\nAmazon has the same goal with its custom AI silicon. Trainium and Inferentia are not meant to challenge Nvidia GPUs on performance alone, but rather to provide customers with a cost-efficient alternative. Some companies would rather pay a premium for the fastest AI chips, but others would gladly use slower chips to save money.\nAmazon is not the only company that is designing custom silicon. Broadcom develops custom AI chips for Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms, and it won a third major customer earlier this year. The company has not named the customer, but Reuters identified it as TikTok parent ByteDance. Additionally, J.P. Morgan\u00a0analysts recently speculated that Broadcom has also secured a contract to build custom AI chips for OpenAI, bringing its total to four major customers.\nJoseph Moore at Morgan Stanley expects that trend to continue. \"Hyperscalers, including Amazon, Google, and Meta, use custom silicon for their data centers due to cost and energy constraints in AI computing. As hyperscalers continue to invest in AI infrastructure, we expect increased demand for energy-efficient and cost optimizing custom chips to outpace the growth of general-purpose GPUs,\" he wrote in a note to clients.\nHere's the big picture: While Nvidia dominates the AI processor market today, input from Amazon and Morgan Stanley indicates the company is virtually guaranteed to lose market share in the years ahead. That does not mean Nvidia will lose its leadership position in the AI chip market. I doubt that will happen. But some spending will inevitably be redirected away from expensive Nvidia GPUs as more cost-efficient alternatives are made available.\nAdditionally, Nvidia will probably lose some pricing power as it fights to maintain its market share. Indeed, the company's gross margin declined 330 basis points sequentially in the most recent quarter, despite reporting 122% revenue growth on strong demand for its AI chips. Investors should expect that trend to continue in the coming quarters.\nHowever, Nvidia is not necessarily a bad investment. In fact, Wall Street still expects its earnings to increase at 37% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 56 times earnings look reasonable. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.5, which is well below the three-year average of 3.1.\nPersonally, I think investors looking to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom should have a position in Nvidia, and I am not alone. A recent note from Jim Kelleher at Argus reads, \"We believe that most technology investors should own [Nvidia] in the age of deep learning, AI, and GPU-driven application acceleration.\"\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock Split Update: Down 2% Since June, History Says the AI Stock Will Do This Next",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "For many investors, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has emerged as the quintessential artificial intelligence (AI) stock. That's because the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center tasks, such as training machine learning models and running AI applications.\nNvidia shares have surged 780% since the generative AI application ChatGPT went viral in late 2022. That event triggered a tidal wave of AI infrastructure spending that is still building momentum, and Nvidia has been one of the biggest beneficiaries. In turn, the stock has become a staple of the AI trade.\nNvidia reset its soaring share price in June by conducting a 10-for-1 stock split. Shares have since tumbled about 2%,\u00a0but history says Nvidia stock may have further to fall.\nGenerally speaking, companies conduct forward stock splits after substantial share price appreciation, which itself is suggestive of compelling growth prospects and a competitive edge. Companies that possess those qualities tend to produce above-average returns for shareholders.\nIndeed, Bank of America reviewed data back to 1980 and found a correlation. Companies that split their stock returned an average of 25.4% during the 12 months after announcing the split. By comparison, the S&P 500 returned an average of 11.9% during the same period.\nHere's what that could mean: Nvidia announced its latest stock split after the market closed on May 22, 2024. The stock traded at a split-adjusted $95 per share. History says its share price will increase 25.4% to $119 by May 2025. But the stock already trades at $119 per share, leaving zero implied upside (or downside) over the next eight months.\nWe can also make predictions about Nvidia's future performance by reviewing company-specific data. For instance, the chipmaker completed five stock splits prior to the most recent one. The chart below shows how the stock performed during the 12 months and 24 months following those five splits.\nStock Split Date\n12-Month Return\n24-Month Return\nJune 2000\n28%\n(52%)\nSeptember 2001\n(72%)\n(49%)\nApril 2006\n1%\n(6%)\nSeptember 2007\n(70%)\n(53%)\nJuly 2021\n(4%)\n145%\nAverage\n(23%)\n(3%)\nData source: YCharts.\nAs shown above, Nvidia has usually performed poorly following stock splits. Its share price has declined by an average of 23% during the first 12 months and was still down by 3% on average after 24 months.\nHere's what that could mean: Nvidia completed its 10-for-1 split after the market closed on June 7. The stock traded at a split-adjusted $121 per share. History says its share price will drop 23% to $93 by June 2025. The stock currently trades at $119 per share, so the implied downside is 22% over the next nine months.\nHaving said that, past performance is never a guarantee of future results. Moreover, most of the stock splits listed in the chart took place within 12 months of a recession, so Nvidia had little chance of posting positive returns. Going forward, whether Nvidia is a good investment depends on its financial performance and what investors are willing to pay to own shares of the company.\nNvidia dominates the market for data center GPUs, chips used to speed up workloads like AI applications. The company accounted for 98% of data center GPU shipments in 2023, essentially unchanged from the prior year, and those GPUs account for more than 80% of AI chips.\nThere are two reasons for that dominance. First, Nvidia designs the most powerful GPUs money can buy, and rapid product development keeps its GPUs on the cutting edge in terms of performance. Second, Nvidia complements its chips with a robust ecosystem of software libraries and developer tools called CUDA. The CUDA platform streamlines the building of GPU-accelerated applications.\nAccording to Grand View Research, graphics processor sales are projected to grow at 27% annually through 2030, driven by the proliferation of machine learning and AI. Nvidia's sales should increase at a similar pace, plus or minus a few percentage points. However, earnings may grow a bit faster due to share repurchases and potential margin expansion driven by pricing power.\nWall Street forecasts adjusted earnings will increase at 35% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027).

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Most Active Stocks To Invest In Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other active stocks.\nThe economic landscape is currently marked by mixed signals. The Fed has indicated the potential for additional rate cuts due to weaknesses in the manufacturing sector, despite signs of recovery. While the overall economy remains strong, currency dynamics have shifted, with the US dollar weakening and the euro strengthening. Interest rate yields have fluctuated, suggesting potential changes in investor sentiment. Amidst this complex environment, the Dow continues to hover near record highs, reflecting cautious optimism among market participants.\nAs stakeholders navigate these developments, they will need to carefully consider how they may influence investment strategies and market behavior in the coming months. CNBC's Rick Santelli recently covered this situation, which we talked about in our article on the 10 Best Performing Stocks in 2024. Here's an excerpt from it:\n\u201cChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee has indicated that many more rate cuts may be necessary over the next year due to signs of weakness in the manufacturing sector. CNBC\u2019s Rick Santelli, who was reporting on September 23, noted that while manufacturing has faced challenges, there are indications it might be recovering slightly, as evidenced by a recent production increase of 0.8%.\nHowever, a lot of analysts do not have an opinion as nuanced as that of Santelli. For instance, Michael Kantrowitz, Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist joined CNBC's 'Power Lunch' on September 23 to discuss why smaller businesses and consumers need the benefits from more rate cuts.\nIn a conversation regarding the challenges facing US car manufacturers, it was noted that the biggest threat they encounter is the influx of Chinese automobiles into the US market. This concern contrasted with the insights from the President of the Bank of Chicago, who stated that ongoing rate cuts will continue to benefit smaller businesses and consumers who are currently adjusting to higher interest rates. Kantrowitz\u00a0emphasized the significant impact that lower interest rates can have on the consumer economy, particularly given the substantial amount of debt tied to credit lines and credit cards. As adjustable-rate mortgages decrease, this easing of financial conditions is expected to be beneficial.\nKantrowitz pointed out that before last week, financial conditions had been easing primarily for larger corporations, as evidenced by the S&P 500, which did not require a rate cut. However, small businesses and consumers, who are more closely tied to the prime rate set by banks, had not experienced similar relief until recently. The last report indicated that small businesses were paying an interest rate of 9.5% for 3-month borrowing. This recent easing represents a crucial first step for Main Street, although the strategist believes further cuts are necessary.\nHe noted a broadening market trend following the July 11 CPI report, highlighting that commercial real estate has emerged as one of the best-performing sectors this quarter, alongside utilities and regional banks. However, it was emphasized that while rate cuts can benefit certain areas indirectly, such as those affected by lower tenure rates, they do not necessarily provide direct support.\nLooking ahead at interest rates, there was speculation about how low they might go in the next year. Kantrowitz suggested that policy rates could indeed fall into the 3% range but cautioned that markets might be overly aggressive in their expectations. The anticipated rise in unemployment will play a critical role in shaping equity and fixed-income markets; however, if unemployment increases at a slow and steady pace, as it has been, it may not pose significant challenges to market stability.\nKantrowitz's opinion reflects a cautious optimism regarding economic conditions as stakeholders face uncertain conditions while keeping an eye on interest rates and their broader implications for various sectors within the economy.\nMethodology\nWe sifted through Yahoo Finance's list of the most active stocks that are experiencing high trading volumes. We looked at the top 15 stocks to find the ones that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We then narrowed down our list to the 10 stocks with high trading volumes and that were the most popular among hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their trading volumes, as of September 23.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and sells graphics processing units (GPUs), artificial intelligence (AI) chips, and other computing technologies. Its GPUs are widely used in gaming, professional visualization, and AI applications, and the company has been a pioneer in the field of GPU computing, with a significant role in the development of AI and deep learning.\nIn FQ2 2025, the company's revenue was 122.40% from a year-ago period. Data center revenue was up 54% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers contributed ~45% of data center revenue. Partnerships with healthcare institutions and increasing demand for AI-powered solutions in diagnostics have contributed to this strong financial performance.\nAt its GPU Technology Conference earlier this year, the CEO estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion, with a potential total of $1-2 trillion over the next decade. The company won't dominate the entire market, but analysts estimate its market share between 2025 and 2029 will be over $950 billion.\nElon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has brought Colossal, an AI training system, online. Powered by 100,000 H100 GPUs from NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Colossal is the most powerful AI training system in the world. Musk plans to double the size of Colossal by shifting to H200 GPUs in the coming months. Blackwell chips, which are even faster and more efficient, could further enhance Colossal's capabilities.\nThe company faces pressure to launch new products to maintain investor confidence. Delays in Blackwell chip production and concerns about high GPU prices impact demand. The company's future success depends on effective AI monetization. By the end of fiscal year 2025, it aims to achieve 100% renewable electricity for its offices and data centers.\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the most active stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other big tech stocks.\nBig tech has long been an immensely popular area to invest in when it comes to US stocks, and for good reason. Tech stocks, particularly those investing in AI and offering AI products, have been generating immense returns in 2024, with the second week of September bearing witness to their immense potential. This week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their best returns for the entire year, and many tech stocks were part of the faction that made this possible. As a result, there's a huge rise in the popularity of AI and tech stocks. This is in stark contrast to market opinions on AI stocks, particularly during the first week of September, when many were very concerned that we are in an AI hypecycle that is bound to wind down soon.\nAltimeter Capital's CEO, Brad Gerstner, recently joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss trends shaping big tech right now. He noted that the pace of\u00a0 AI at present is faster than any other tech development seen before. He also added that many investors are starting to lean back into big tech ahead of the election. This development may be coming about because of the historical trend that suggests that stocks perform better in the months directly following a US election - in which case, it makes sense for investors to be piling into big tech and AI right now since that's a sure shot way to profit in the next few months.\nA recent notable trend that people have begun to see because of the rise of big tech companies and the growing use of AI is a greater demand for power. Many major tech companies are beginning to require more energy, with the AWS-owner going as far as buying a nuclear-powered data center for $650 million recently.\nThe primary driving force for this rising demand is the need to develop AI. Many energy-conscious investors may see this new trend as a red flag for big tech. However, Jensen Huang has noted that while AI takes a ton of energy to train, once developed and trained, it will also help save energy. He particularly noted that AI is going to become so advanced through this development that it will eventually end up offering solutions that can change the way we use energy, making our operations endlessly more energy efficient.\nWith this in mind, big tech seems to be quite an interesting space to follow right now, especially in the days leading up to the US Presidential Elections. As such, we've compiled a list of the best big tech stocks to buy right now.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nFor our list below, we selected big-tech stocks with the highest numbers of hedge funds holding stakes in them during the second quarter and then ranked them based on this metric in ascending order.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is perhaps the most famous semiconductor company in the market right now. It is based in Santa Clara, California.\nWhile the semiconductor sector has historically been highly cyclical, meaning that stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) tend to go through boom and bust cycles in line with the economy, this chip maker's recent performance has been such that investors are confident in its ability to weather any storm. Over the past four quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has posted record results, with profit margins expanding to over 60%.\nThe driving force behind these results is the fact that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) products are seeing high demand from almost every cloud infrastructure company and AI start-up. Because of this demand, investors believe that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could continue to do well even in a recession. In fact, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is seeing so much demand that it's struggling to meet the needs of those vying for its components - this then has become one of the biggest challenges for the company, with CEO Jensen Huang beginning to feel the pressure to deliver more Nvidia products to a growing number of customers.\nIn total, 179 hedge funds were long NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $53.7 billion.\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the best big tech stocks to buy.

        "Text": "It's no secret that Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock price has surged in recent years thanks largely to its association with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the massive spending being done to expand data center computing power. Along with the price surge has come a surge in valuation for the stock.\nIf you are the type of investor who doesn't like buying hot stocks at hefty valuations but still wants some exposure to the spending jump related to AI and data centers, Johnson Controls (NYSE: JCI) might be the answer. Here's why this heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) specialist offers a great AI-related alternative to high-priced Nvidia.\nJohnson Controls stock received some positive ratings from heavyweight Wall Street investment companies recently. Bank of America analysts upgraded the stock to a buy rating and increased the price target to $80 (from $76), while Morgan Stanley analysts initiated coverage on Johnson Controls with an $85 price target and an overweight rating.\nAnalysts at both firms mentioned positive indicators involving end-market exposure for Johnson Controls. Bank of America's analyst asserted that Johnson Controls will generate 14% of its revenue from data centers this year. At the same time, Morgan Stanley's analyst said the company's solutions help building owners create efficiency gains -- a good theme as property owners seek to cut costs.\nThe AI/data center angle is relevant to the HVAC sector. Robust HVAC solutions are needed to maintain a controlled environment in data centers so equipment can perform optimally.\nThat's one reason why HVAC companies' shares have generally outperformed this year. However, Johnson Controls has underperformed its immediate peers, Trane Technologies (NYSE: TT) and Carrier Global (NYSE: CARR).\nIt also trades at a valuation discount to its peers.\nOne reason the stock underperformed the competition was management's patchy record with guidance. Johnson Controls missed its own estimates on earnings in 2022 and sales in 2023. That pattern continued in its fiscal 2024 (which ended Sept. 30, 2024). During its fiscal Q2 earnings call in May, management maintained its guidance for full-year organic sales growth in the mid-single-digit range, only to cut it to approximately 3% in its Q3 report released on July 31.\nIt's unclear if the company's disappointing execution is why activist hedge funds are taking positions in the stock. Still, we know George Oliver announced he would retire as CEO in conjunction with that same third-quarter report. Hopefully, its next leader will be able to take advantage of the company's significant growth opportunities.\nWhile organic sales growth of 3% isn't what investors expected this year, the company's orders and backlog continue to grow. Oliver noted \"strong demand for our data center solutions,\" and asserted, \"We have built a leading position in data centers in North America, due to a unique and compelling customer value proposition.\"\nAlongside the growth in data center demand to support the computing power needs of AI, Johnson Controls has an excellent growth opportunity coming from the trend of retrofitting buildings as owners strive to cut costs and reduce their carbon footprint. These efficiency gains are also being driven by the increasing use of digital technology in buildings, and the company continues to see strong adoption of its OpenBlue digital platform.\nA third catalyst that could lift its stock price comes from the company restructuring to focus on its core commercial and industrial HVAC business, not least by agreeing to sell its residential and light commercial HVAC business to Bosch in a transaction valued at $8.1 billion. (Johnson Controls will receive $6.7 billion.)\nAlongside the sale of its air distribution technologies business, Johnson Controls will divest businesses responsible for about 20% of its overall sales, becoming a much more focused company in the process.\nAfter those divestitures, an even larger share of the company's revenue will come from data centers and AI, while the underlying growth from the race to net zero will continue to support order and backlog growth.\nJohnson Controls may not be as exciting a stock as Nvidia, but the company looks undervalued given its potential. Investors can expect good returns from the stock if management delivers on the opportunities outlined above.\nBefore you buy stock in Johnson Controls International, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Johnson Controls International wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia has been a bellwether in the artificial intelligence (AI) space thanks to its graphics processing units (GPUs) that have played a crucial role in the training and deployment of AI models. But the stock has fallen out of favor of late as investors are worried about its slowing growth.\nThis is evident from the fact that the stock is down 5% since releasing its fiscal 2025 second-quarter results on Aug. 28. The chipmaker's quarterly revenue jumped an impressive 122% year over year to $30 billion last quarter as it continued to dominate the market for AI chips, while its terrific pricing power resulted in a 152% year-over-year increase in adjusted\u00a0earnings to $0.68 per share.\nHowever, management's forecast that its revenue would increase at a relatively slower pace of 80% year over year in the current quarter seems to have made investors jittery. There is no doubt that Nvidia is still on track to grow at a very healthy pace and continues as the undisputed leader in the AI chip market, but it seems that the company's expensive valuation is counting against it.\nMeanwhile, another AI company that recently released its results has seen its stock price zoom higher despite growing much slower than Nvidia. Here's a closer look at this name and why it seems like a solid AI stock right now.\nOracle (NYSE: ORCL) has jumped into the limelight this year as AI is driving a marked acceleration in the company's cloud business. This is why shares of the company, which was traditionally known for its database software, shot up more than 11% following the release of its fiscal 2025 first-quarter results (for the period ended Aug. 31) on Sept. 9.\nTotal revenue increased 8% year over year to $13.3 billion in constant currency terms, clearing the $13.2 billion consensus estimate. Adjusted earnings increased at a faster pace of 17% from the same period last year to $1.39 per share, which was again higher than the $1.33 Wall Street estimate.\nHowever, all eyes were on Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPO), a measure of the total value of a company's contracts that will be fulfilled at a future date. The company's RPO jumped 53% from the same quarter last year to a record $99 billion, suggesting that it is building an impressive revenue pipeline that should supercharge its growth in the long run.\nMore specifically, Oracle's overall cloud revenue jumped 22% year over year during the quarter to $5.6 billion, while there was a 46% spike in cloud infrastructure revenue to $2.2 billion. Management said that 42 additional cloud GPU contracts were signed for a total of $3 billion in the previous quarter.\nMoreover, the demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure is outpacing supply, which is why the company intends to continue investing in capacity to satisfy the burgeoning end-market. As a result, it said its capital expenditure in fiscal 2025 would be double last year's levels. That might seem like an ambitious move, but the demand for cloud infrastructure for training and deploying AI models is increasing rapidly.\nCustomers are renting Oracle's infrastructure to scale up AI development, and this trend is likely for a long time to come as Goldman Sachs estimates that the demand for cloud services could increase at an annual rate of 22% through 2030, generating $1 trillion in annual revenue. The investment bank points out that generative AI could account for $200 billion to $300 billion of this spending on the back of investments by companies looking to create AI applications.\nSpecifically, the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) market -- which was Oracle's fastest-growing segment last quarter -- could generate $580 billion in revenue in 2030. Therefore, the company could be at the beginning of a stupendous growth opportunity as its IaaS revenue stood at $2.2 billion in the fiscal first quarter, translating to an annual revenue run rate of $8.8 billion this fiscal year.\nManagement says that its strong contract backlog will increase revenue growth throughout fiscal 2025. So the company expects its fiscal second-quarter sales to increase between 8% and 10% in constant currency terms, which would be a slight improvement over the previous quarter.\nMore importantly, the company is confident that its fiscal 2025 top line is on track to increase by double digits, with full-year total cloud-infrastructure revenue growing faster than last year.\nAnd analysts expect this double-digit growth to continue over the next couple of fiscal years as well.\nBut investors have already seen how big the cloud computing market is expected to become thanks to the adoption of AI. So don't be surprised to see Oracle's growth improve in the coming years, and the market could reward that with more upside.\nThat's why it could be a good idea for investors to buy Oracle while it is trading at an attractive 25 times forward earnings, a discount to the Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple of 31 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). This AI stock could fly higher following the 54% gain it has clocked so far this year.\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

Market experts believe that from 2023 beginning to May 2024 end, only a handful of the biggest and most well-established technology companies drove ~60% of the S&P 500\u2019s 40%+ gain.\nFactSet reported that, for 2Q 2024 (with 93% of S&P 500 companies publishing actual results), ~79% of the S&P 500 companies reported positive EPS surprises. On the other hand, ~60% of S&P 500 companies reported positive revenue surprises. In 2Q 2024, semiconductor companies\u2019 stocks were the critical drivers for the S&P 500 Index. The AI themes supported other sectors, like utilities, seeking support from higher electricity demand for AI data centers.\nWall Street experts believe that estimates for 3Q 2024 have seen a decline and the magnitude of estimate cuts seems to be significantly bigger than compared to the comparable periods of the first 2 quarters of 2024. Market participants opine that total S&P 500 earnings should see an increase of 3.9% from the same period of last year on 4.7% revenue growth. These estimates have come down since the beginning of the period, as the current 3.9% growth had fallen from 6.9% at the beginning of July.\nThe decline in estimates stems from the risks associated with economic downside, slower disinflation, expectations for higher-for-longer rates, and increased geopolitical risks. \u00a0Apart from these risks, the uncertainty around the US Presidential elections remains the most important factor responsible for the decline in estimates.\nWall Street analysts believe that uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election is expected to rise as the November vote draws closer. This can act as an additional headwind in the environment already demonstrating signs of losing momentum.\nReuters reported that populism, polarization, and an expected tight race can result in a surge in the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU). This is a news-headline-based index, which was created by economics professors Steven J. Davis, Scott R. Baker, and Nick Bloom. The rise in EPU takes place when an uncertain outlook about government policy prompts consumers to delay their spending and forces businesses to put a halt on investment and hiring.\nBrandywine Global Investment Management (A Franklin Templeton Company), an investment management firm, believes that this might be happening in the current environment. The firm noted that the University of Michigan's current economic conditions index remains below the expectations index. Notably, this is a rare occurrence, suggesting that consumers are anxious.\nAnalysts at Brandywine Global believe that this year's election cycle, whether warranted or not, continues to impact the US consumer, which in turn, is impacting the corporate sector.\nIn the 2020 follow-up working paper, Davis (the co-founder of the EPU index) and his colleagues revealed that the EPU index tends to increase by ~18% in the month of November during a Presidential election. When elections come close, and there is a winning margin of less than 5%, and polarized, the EPU index can jump by ~28% in election month.\nPolitical uncertainty can be a more powerful factor in asset prices, with investors focusing on the US Presidential elections. A JPMorgan survey revealed that investors continue to see political risk in the US and abroad as the top destabilizing metric for equities.\nAI fever coupled with strong earnings has supported broader equities in 1H 2024, and gains have been concentrated in technology and growth stocks. Analysts opine that some investors are still looking for areas of the market that have underperformed, and they expect that the recent rally in tech might spread into other sectors as well. Most investors welcomed the signs of a slowdown in inflation and moderation in growth. As a result, the US Fed has hinted to cut key interest rates. With uncertainties looming, market experts believe that investors should stick to the big stocks, which have a healthy track record of delivering strong gains.\nOur methodology \nTo select the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now, we used the Yahoo Finance and Finviz stock screeners to filter stocks with biggest market caps from different industries.

Its chips are used in several end markets, such as high-end PCs for gaming, data centers, and automotive infotainment systems.\nNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) has been making investments for over a decade in its software capabilities in a unique way which has enabled its hardware to outperform regular silicon. This outperformance was seen because of software optimizations and acceleration libraries as these are regularly updated. GenAI continues to drive data center growth. The next-gen models require 10x-20x more compute and data, and this is where NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s extremely powerful chips come to the rescue.\nUndoubtedly, the company\u2019s strong position related to graphics processing units, and switching costs associated with its proprietary software, CUDA platform, for AI tools should act as critical growth enablers. NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s GPUs and software platforms\u00a0should capitalize on the elevated demand for its AI applications, mainly in data centers where high-performance computing remains important. Spectrum-X, which is a high-performance Ethernet platform, has been gaining traction. Also, sovereign AI opportunities are expanding, with more and more countries prioritizing AI development.\nFor 3Q 2025, NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) expects revenue of $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. During 1H 2025, the company\u00a0returned\u00a0$15.4 billion\u00a0to shareholders via shares repurchases and cash dividends.\nAnalysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their target price on shares of NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) from $115.00 to $155.00, giving an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on 29th August.

        "Text": "Some market prognosticators would argue that, as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock goes, so goes the artificial intelligence (AI) bull market. Wall Street rallied around Nvidia, thanks to its dominance in the AI chip market. It's the flagship company representing the emergence of large language models and other AI technology, which is arguably the largest technological leap forward since the internet started developing in the late 1990s.\nAfter soaring for most of the past two years, Nvidia's stock price has reversed course. The stock is down about 22% from its June 2024 high. Buying the dip on winning stocks has been a successful investing strategy for years. And to be honest, it's hard to imagine an AI future without Nvidia playing a significant role.\nHowever, you may want to consider these risks before buying the stock today.\nNvidia's AI-friendly GPU chips have become the go-to choice for technology companies building large data centers to run powerful AI models. Approximately $26.3 billion of Nvidia's overall $30 billion in Q2 revenue was from its data center segment, so Nvidia has effectively become a pure play on AI chips. The good news is that data center revenue grew 154% year over year in Q2 and 16% from the prior quarter, a sign that chip demand remains strong.\nAnalysts now estimate Nvidia will earn $2.84 per share this year and $4 per share next year. Using next year's estimates, that prices Nvidia at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 26. If Nvidia grows earnings by 40% annually over the long term, as analysts believe it will, it's arguably a bargain now.\nHowever, there's an argument that Nvidia's revenue, as impressive as it could wind up being, is risky enough that investors may want a tremendous margin of safety to buy the stock. A small handful of companies are propping up Nvidia's sales. Specifically, four companies make up 40% of Nvidia's total revenue. To make matters worse, all four of them -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon -- have worked on developing their own custom AI chips.\nThese companies will not necessarily discontinue using Nvidia's chips entirely (though anything is possible). But Nvidia has enjoyed remarkable pricing power since the AI rush began early last year. AI became a race where speed to market became the priority.\nThere are signs that the AI market is slowly evolving. Investors have openly questioned whether big technology companies see the returns needed to justify all this data center spending.\nMarket research has indicated that traffic to ChatGPT, once the fastest-growing app in history, has dropped in recent months. Amazon's management noted in the company's Q2 earnings call that its AI customers want better value.\nPrice didn't matter when AI was new, but it's starting to become a conversation. That could spell pricing pressure for Nvidia moving forward. The company may have to choose between sacrificing market share to competition or accepting lower margins to retain share.\nThis year, Nvidia is guiding to gross margins in the mid-70s, so this is something to watch in 2025 and beyond. You can see that margins this high are well beyond anything before the pandemic:\nIt's tempting to ignore such a long-term concern, but remember that Nvidia only looks cheap because everyone expects stellar sales and profits years into the future. Margins reverting to long-term averages would be disastrous for investors.\nThese concerns aren't to dissuade you from owning Nvidia. They are raised to keep you aware of the risks. As impressive as Nvidia's financials are today, they've been propped up by a few deep-pocketed customers throwing money at being the early AI winner. Nvidia could be the leading AI chip company 20 years from now, but sales and/or profit margins could also fizzle out and collapse the stock.\nThe tricky part is that both things could be true.\nLong-term investors who would like to buy the stock on this dip should do so responsibly. Consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to accumulate shares slowly. That way, volatility is more of an opportunity than a reason to stress. Nvidia could be a bumpy ride for the foreseeable future, even if it makes investors money in the long run.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "No company has been a bigger winner than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\u00a0as nearly every tech company has collectively poured billions of dollars into developing their generative AI (artificial intelligence) capabilities. The company has added $2.5 trillion to its market cap over the last two years as sales and profits exploded with the demand for its GPUs.\nThe chipmaker has shown incredible pricing power amid the strong demand. That's evidenced by its gross margin expanding into the upper 70% range. And with the booming sales growth, it's seen very high operating leverage, which translates into massive bottom-line growth. To be sure, Nvidia's performance as a business, not just a stock, over the last two years has been nothing short of phenomenal.\nBut Nvidia isn't the only AI chip stock in the market. And CEO Jensen Huang just explained why another company may be worth owning, perhaps even more so than his own company.\nAt an investor conference earlier this month, Huang had high praise for one of Nvidia's biggest business partners: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u00a0(NYSE: TSM), known as TSMC.\nTSMC is the largest semiconductor foundry, or fab, in the world. When a company like Nvidia designs a new chip, it takes it to TSMC to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. That takes incredible precision and innovative technical capabilities. TSMC is the top choice for many chip designers, including Nvidia. TSMC commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries.\n\"We're fabbing out of TSMC because it's the world's best,\" Huang said. \"And it's the world's best not by a small margin, it's the world's best by an incredible margin.\"\nThat's why Nvidia and almost anyone else that needs to produce cutting-edge chips picks TSMC over its competitors. Huang did say Nvidia could switch to another foundry if it had to. But he also said competitors' capabilities can't match TSMC's and it would result in less performance or higher cost.\nHe also praised TSMC's ability to scale its operations. When Nvidia saw demand for its chips skyrocket, TSMC was able to help it meet that growing demand so it could take advantage of the opportunity. Any business that needs to be able to scale up needs to work with TSMC.\nImportantly, TSMC's position as the market leader, winning the majority of revenue in the industry, ensures it'll stay in its leading position. It has more money to reinvest in R&D and create the next generation of processes. The virtuous cycle leads to more and more big contracts with big tech companies designing super high-end chips over time.\nTSMC might be the biggest company in the industry, but there's still a ton of growth for it to capture.\nTech companies are all planning to ramp up their spending on AI systems in data centers. Total spending on AI chip content and related systems is forecast to reach $193.3 billion in 2027, according to estimates from IDC. That's up from $117.5 billion this year, translating into an 18% compound annual growth rate over the next three years.\nImportantly, TSMC is highly agnostic to that growth. Whether that growth comes from Nvidia, one of its competitors, or custom chips designed by its biggest customers, TSMC is likely winning the bulk of those contracts. In fact, the virtuous cycle and TSMC's leadership in cutting-edge chips means it could grow that part of its business even faster than the industry. On top of that, TSMC has room to improve its margins.\nThat's all reflected in analysts' forecasts for the company over the next five years. The average analyst expects TSMC to grow earnings over 20% per year for the next half-decade. But you don't have to pay up for that growth. Shares currently trade at just over 20 times the consensus 2025 earnings forecast.\nFew other companies offer that same level of potential growth at that price. So, not only is it the world's best fab by an incredible margin, investors can buy a stake in it right now at an incredible price.\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price closed out the daily session up 8%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nNvidia stock gained ground in conjunction with a report from Semafor that the U.S. was considering lifting restrictions on the sale of advanced semiconductors to Saudi Arabia. If so, it would open up a new market for the AI company.\nNvidia's valuation also got a significant boost thanks to comments made in a presentation by CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking at the Communacopia and Technology Conference hosted by Goldman Sachs, Huang stated that his company was continuing to see incredible levels of demand.\nHe also issued encouraging guidance for Blackwell, the company's next-generation processors. Huang said that Blackwell's manufacturing has already ramped up, the chips are set to begin shipping to customers in significant numbers in Q4, and demand among customers is very high.\nThe Nvidia CEO also said that his company was approaching its designs with fabrication versatility in mind. The company currently relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to manufacture its chip designs, but it says it's taking steps to ensure it can move to other fabs if necessary.\nOn the heels of some recent volatility for the stock, Jensen Huang gave Nvidia investors a lot of reassuring news today. The report about Nvidia's chips potentially being greenlit for sale in Saudi Arabia also highlights untapped growth opportunities among government customers.\nNvidia has been serving up stellar sales and earnings growth that has powered incredible share price gains, but that's also raised questions among investors about how long the momentum can be sustained.

        "Author": "  Insider Monkey Staff ",
        "Text": "Tech giant Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been on a scintillating run over the past year, powered by AI-driven innovations catapulting its stock to breathtaking heights. However, following its rollicking performance for the better part of the year, we've seen NVIDIA stock take a much-needed breather. Nonetheless, with multiple catalysts powering its bullish momentum, particularly with its game-changing Blackwell processors, it's difficult to ignore Nvidia at any point in the AI race. The recent dip in Nvidia's stock price presents an excellent opportunity to buy into its growth story before a sustained rally fueled by upcoming interest rate cuts.\nSEE ALSO 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic\nFor those who've been out of the loop for the past couple of years, Nvidia is a front-runner in AI and accelerated computing markets. Its explosive success in AI infrastructure, driven by its cutting-edge AI chips like the H100 and the eagerly anticipated Blackwell processors, led to north of 140% gain in its stock over the past year alone. Moreover, as we look ahead, the booming demand for AI chips continues pushing Nvidia to even greater heights as the AI revolution moves past the genesis stage.\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nQ2 Results Were Encouraging\nNvidia investors soured over the company's Q2 results, dampening enthusiasm with a relatively soft Q3 guidance. However, investors accustomed to Nvidia's stellar performances quickly ignored another monstrous quarterly showing, marked by a 122% revenue increase to $30.04 billion, beating estimates by a whopping $1.30 billion.\u00a0 Additionally, on the bottom-line, its net income surged 168%, driven by a roughly 155% increase in data center sales on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. However, the market punditry quickly pointed to a relatively sluggish 16% sequential growth from a previous 23%. Also, contracted from 78% in Q1 to 75% in Q2. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the relatively modest revenue guidance of $32.5 billion for Q3 fell short of expectations. Consequently, Nvidia stock dipped post-earnings and has been down more than 7% in the past week.\nBright Outlook Ahead\nDespite the supposed weak performance in Q2, Nvidia has plenty on its plate to continue growing rapidly. Based on analyst estimates, we could see the tech giant wrapping up the year with $125.50 billion in sales, a massive 105% jump from the last fiscal year. Moreover, its upcoming Blackwell architecture is touted as a major step up from previous iterations, which could significantly enhance AI performance and capabilities. The new platform integrates various advanced technologies, promising to outperform the current Hopper architecture dramatically. On top of that, the company is sitting on an enormous cash war chest, having generated more cash flow in the first two quarters of fiscal 2025 than in all four quarters last year.\nMoreover, with Blackwell added to the mix, we could see a stunner of a Q4 this year for the company, kickstarting another rally. The bears will quickly point out the stock's lofty price metrics, trading more than 30 times, trailing twelve-month (TTM) sales. However, based on 2025 estimates, it trades at approximately 16 times its 2025 sales at $174.25 billion. Also, based on 43 Wall Street analysts, it attracts a Strong Buy Rating, offering a 27% upside from current price levels.\nNVDA is ranked 6th on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 179 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the second quarter which was 186 in the previous quarter.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Did you analyze how Nvidia (NVDA) fared in its international operations for the quarter ending July 2024? Given the widespread global presence of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence, scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities.\nIn the modern, closely-knit global economic landscape, the capacity of a business to access foreign markets is often a key determinant of its financial well-being and growth path. Investors now place great importance on grasping the extent of a company's dependence on international markets, as it sheds light on the firm's earnings stability, its skill in leveraging various economic cycles and its broad growth potential.\nParticipation in global economies acts as a defense against economic difficulties at home and a pathway to more rapidly developing economies. However, it also comes with the complexities of dealing with fluctuating currencies, geopolitical risks and different market dynamics.\nWhile delving into NVDA's performance for the past quarter, we observed some fascinating trends in the revenue from its foreign segments that are commonly modeled and observed by analysts on Wall Street.\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter stood at $30.04 billion, increasing 122.4% year over year. Now, let's delve into NVDA's international revenue breakdown to gain insights into the significance of its operations beyond home turf.\nOf the total revenue, $3.67 billion came from China (including Hong Kong) during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 12.2%. This represented a surprise of +27.49% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $2.88 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $2.49 billion, or 9.6%, and $2.74 billion, or 20.3%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, Taiwan contributed $5.74 billion in revenue, making up 19.1% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $5.75 billion, this meant a surprise of -0.23%. Looking back, Taiwan contributed $4.37 billion, or 16.8%, in the previous quarter, and $2.84 billion, or 21%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\nIt is projected by analysts on Wall Street that Nvidia will post revenues of $32.59 billion for the ongoing fiscal quarter, an increase of 79.8% from the year-ago quarter. The expected contributions from China (including Hong Kong) and Taiwan to this revenue are 10.1% and 19.1%, translating into $3.27 billion and $6.21 billion, respectively.\nFor the full year, the company is expected to generate $122.19 billion in total revenue, up 100.6% from the previous year. Revenues from China (including Hong Kong) and Taiwan are expected to constitute 10.1% ($12.37 billion) and 18.4% ($22.46 billion) of the total, respectively.\nThe dependency of Nvidia on global markets for its revenues presents a mix of potential gains and hazards. Thus, monitoring the trends in its overseas revenues can be a key indicator for predicting the firm's future performance.\nWith the increasing intricacies of global interdependence and geopolitical strife, Wall Street analysts meticulously observe these patterns, especially for companies with an international footprint, to tweak their forecasts of earnings. Importantly, several additional factors, such as a company's domestic market status, also impact these earnings forecasts.\nEmphasizing a company's shifting earnings prospects is a key aspect of our approach at Zacks, especially since research has proven its substantial influence on a stock's price in the short run. This correlation is positively aligned, meaning that improved earnings projections tend to boost the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating mechanism, demonstrates a notable performance history confirmed through external audits. It effectively utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions to act as a predictor of a stock's price performance in the near term.\nNvidia currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating that it could perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -8.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has lost 9.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.74 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +85%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7.7%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.81 points to a change of +116.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.8%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.73 indicates a change of +32.8% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +8.7%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $32.59 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +79.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $124.17 billion and $170.63 billion estimates indicate +103.8% and +37.4% changes, respectively.\nNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +122.4%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.27 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.72%. The EPS surprise was +6.25%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Daniyal Jawaid ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Stocks To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the 10 best stocks to buy right now according to billionaire Cliff Asness.\nThe investment approach of Cliff Asness, through his multi-billion dollar hedge fund AQR Capital Management, is quite unique. While some investors such as\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0and\u00a0Seth Klarman\u00a0focus on value, and others like\u00a0Ken Fisher\u00a0focus on growth, Asness\u2019 fund tries to quantitatively define what quality is.\nWhile it sounds like a tall order, the hedge fund investor whose latest net worth is estimated to be $2 billion, has written quite a bit on the determinants of a quality stock. One such work came in the form of a research paper published in 2013. In it, Asness and his co authors shared three primary drivers of a quality stock. These are a stock\u2019s profitability, growth, and safety. Within these three factors, profitability is driven by gross profits over assets, return on equity, return on assets, cash flow over assets, gross margin, and the portion of earnings that was cash. A quality stock\u2019s growth is determined by the five year average growth in the per share values of the first five profitability factors, while a stock\u2019s safety is based on its beta, leverage, bankruptcy risk, and return on equity volatility.\nUsing these metrics, Asness built two portfolios. The first portfolio selected stocks based on the quality metrics, while the latter, called Quality Minus Junk (QMJ) goes long on the quality stocks and shorts the junk stocks. QMJ is more characteristic of AQR Capital\u2019s investment approach. The results showed that without adjusting for risk, the ten sub quality portfolios starting from a quality score of one and ending at ten all had positive excess returns over Treasury bills.\nThese\u00a0returns\u00a0ranged from 28 basis points of excess returns for the lowest quality portfolio to 70 basis points for the highest quality portfolio. The difference in the highest and lowest returns for these portfolios was the sharpest when they were tuned for the Carhart Four Factor Model that adds momentum to the traditional three factor Fama Factor model. The difference was 105 basis points per month for the four factor adjustment.\nLooking at the\u00a0returns\u00a0for the QMJ portfolio, these jump to 60 basis points for the four factor model for US stocks and 61 basis points per month for the three and four factor models for global equities. When the US and global monthly excess returns are\u00a0plotted\u00a0over time for cumulative alpha, they sit at roughly 425% for the US between 1957 and 2016 and at 200% for global stocks between 1986 and 2012.\nShifting gears, as 2023 proved to be beneficial to the stock market because of returns driven by large cap stocks and artificial intelligence, AQR Capital also posted strong results. As per Reuters, the fund\u2019s Absolute Return Strategy delivered 18.5% in returns in 2023, while the AQR Equity Market Neutral Global Value strategy returned a stronger 20.6% in net returns. Before fees, the Absolute Return\u2019s returns were 55%, with the net, or post fee returns sitting at 43.5% in 2022\u00a0according\u00a0to Bloomberg,\nAQR\u2019s double digit performance continued during the first quarter. More data sourced by Bloomberg shows that AQR\u2019s Managed Futures Full Volatility Strategy, Delphi Long Short Equity Strategy, and Apex Strategy gained 17.4%, 13%, and 11%, during Q1 2024. Insider Monkey\u2019s data shows that the cumulative value of the hedge fund\u2019s stock holdings filed with the SEC was $58.7 billion by the end of that time period marking a $13.1 billion or 28.7% annual jump. Double digit returns in a quarter are no small matter, and some of the best known hedge funds such as\u00a0Citadel Wellington,\u00a0Point72, and\u00a0Millennium\u00a05.8%, 5.3%, and 3.7% in respective returns during the same time period.\nBefore we get to our list of Cliff Asness\u2019 top stock picks, it\u2019s also important to see how his firms\u2019 funds have performed so far during the year. September has marked the start of a paradigm shift on Wall Street in the form of the Federal Reserve starting its interest rate cuts in the form of a 50 basis point cut. However, the Fed\u2019s data seems to have disappointed investors as it indicates that as of mid September, it expects the rate to sit at 3.25% \u2013 3.50% by 2025 end.\nWhen looking at the returns of AQR\u2019s different funds year to date, it appears that momentum is one of the top plays as of now. This is because the AQR Large Cap Momentum Style Fund has delivered 21.70% in year to date returns which is roughly three percentage points higher than the benchmark index\u2019s 18.64% in returns. On the flip side, the AQR Large Cap Defensive Style Fund has delivered 16.11% in year to date returns which are 2.53 percentage points lower than the benchmark\u2019s returns. Judging by this, the momentum fund which touts to invest in stocks \u201cconsidered to have positive momentum if it has performed well in the prior 12 months relative to other stocks in the investment universe\u201d has been the way to go so far in 2024.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to buy according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of his fund AQR Capital\u2019s Q2 2024 13F SEC filings and picked out the most valuable stakes.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors based on Insider Monkey\u2019s research. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 179 AQR Funds\u2019 Latest Investment Stake: $1.92 billion NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world\u2019s leading GPU designer. Its chips are the top performers in the industry when it comes to computing AI workloads and enabling accelerated computing. This has enabled NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to transform itself from a firm that sold gaming GPUs to an enterprise and data center products provider. Subsequently, its hypothesis rests on the accelerated computing and AI associated demand for its GPUs and the ability to keep costs low. A slowdown on any of these fronts could see investors reevaluate their views on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and price out the future revenue growth estimates that have propelled the stock to a market capitalization of $2.92 trillion. Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) enjoys considerable design advantages, it can continue to be the primary industry GPU supplier for the future. However, large firms like Meta and Google might increase the presence of their own chips in infrastructure to create headwinds. Additionally, a lack of industry AI adoption could spell trouble. Baron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\u201cMore recently, however, we\u2019ve entered the period of doubts and questioning, some of which is real and normal in the first stages of a new paradigm, and some of which is prompted by short sellers. Given the explosive returns of NVIDIA and other AI leaders, AI bears and fear mongers have been comparing the current AI market winners with the internet bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, and NVIDIA\u2019s stock move today with Cisco\u2019s back then. First, while many stocks were trading at nosebleed valuations and on made up metrics (such as price per eyeballs) before the bursting of the internet bubble, as we\u2019ve said many times, the internet proved to transform our world and create the digital age we are now living in. Second, while NVIDIA\u2019s stock price inflection has been nothing short of unprecedented for a company of its size, it was fueled almost entirely by explosive growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows\u2013 not multiple expansion. Over the last 12 months, NVIDIA\u2019s stock has effectively tripled, but its forward P/E multiple has remained essentially flat, because NVIDIA blew away Wall Street expectations despite being covered by over 60 sell-side analysts, who have increased their forward projections every single quarter. In my career, the only comparative analogue is when Apple first introduced the iPhone and stunned Wall Street with its growth. In contrast, most of Cisco\u2019s move in the late 1990s was due to multiple expansion. At its peak, Cisco traded at a P/E ratio over 130 times, more than quadruple its five-year average of 37 times. At the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA traded at a P/E ratio of 40 times, equal to its five-year average, and at a P/E to growth (or PEG) ratio for 2025 of 0.8 times, as consensus expectations are for NVIDIA to grow earnings per share 40% next year. Moreover, investor concerns have arisen about the financial impact AI is having and whether surging capital expenditures (capex) across the technology landscape, particularly the large cloud players (Microso, Google, Amazon, and Meta), known as the hyperscalers, will be justified and earn reasonable returns on invested capital (ROIC). First, the adoption and penetration of new technology typically traces a classic S-curve\u2013or more precisely, in our view, a series of S-curves or phases. For at least the past year and a half, we\u2019ve been in what might be called the AI infrastructure- build phase \u2013 building the AI factories, as NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has articulated it, and this phase has been dominated by the infrastructure- layer players \u2013 the accelerated computing chips suppliers like NVIDIA and Broadcom, as well as data center, cloud infrastructure and energy companies. The hyperscalers, other enterprises, and sovereign entities investing ahead understand that if you want to be in the AI game, you must invest now \u2013 build the infrastructure, build the factories \u2013 or else you\u2019ll find yourselves disrupted on the sidelines or playing catch up in the biggest game, the most important race in a technology generation. Only those who invest today even have the chance to be the winners of the future.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list. While we acknowledge NVDA's potential as an AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

He discussed NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it.\nNvidia\u2019s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\nAt Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\nOf course, Nvidia won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs).

NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings.

As AI technology continues to evolve, the importance it has to large enterprises is underscored by significant investments and impressive returns. For example, the ability of AI to automate and optimize business processes is one of the most significant advantages for large companies. AI-driven automation can streamline supply chain management, optimize logistics, and improve customer service through chatbots and personalized recommendations. According to a report by McKinsey, companies that fully leverage AI could see a 20-25% increase in cash flow\u200b.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic.\nIn financial services, AI is transforming risk management, fraud detection, and customer insights. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, uses AI to review legal documents, a task that used to take thousands of hours of manual work, now accomplished in mere seconds. In the pharmaceutical industry, AI is accelerating drug discovery processes. For instance, companies like Pfizer have used AI to analyze vast datasets to identify potential drug candidates much faster than traditional methods. This not only speeds up the time-to-market for new drugs but also significantly reduces research and development costs, which are estimated to average around $2.6 billion per drug\u200b.\nMoreover, AI is enabling companies to offer more personalized experiences to customers. Retail giants like Amazon and Walmart use AI algorithms to analyze customer behavior and preferences, tailoring recommendations that enhance the shopping experience and increase sales. Amazon\u2019s recommendation engine, powered by AI, is responsible for 35% of the company\u2019s total sales\u200b. NVIDIA, a leader in AI hardware, exemplifies how AI can drive business success. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported $30 billion in revenue, with AI contributing significantly to this figure\u200b. The company\u2019s GPUs are the backbone of AI models used across industries, from autonomous vehicles to large-scale data analysis, demonstrating the critical role AI plays in both revenue generation and technological advancement.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have been in the news this week.

        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other ESG stocks.\nDefining ESG can sometimes be straightforward: it\u2019s a finance and investing approach centered on managing risks related to environmental factors, social issues, and corporate governance. Although the concept emerged about two decades ago through a collaboration between United Nations officials and the finance industry, who argued that addressing ESG risks like climate change, labor disputes, and poor corporate governance can safeguard investments, it wasn\u2019t until the late 2010s and into the 2020s that ESG evolved into a more proactive movement, rather than a reactive one.\nA report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, with the global average near-surface temperature reaching 1.45\u00b0C\u2014closer than ever to the 1.5\u00b0C lower limit set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. Another report from the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also reveals that climate-driven disasters are already surpassing scientists\u2019 initial predictions. This urgency has sparked increased interest in niche yet rapidly expanding sectors of ESG investing, such as climate-transition funds and catastrophe bonds. In 2024, global investment in clean energy is expected to hit a significant milestone, doubling the amount allocated to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) 2024 World Energy Investment report forecasts that total global energy investment will surpass $3 trillion this year, with $2 trillion directed toward clean technologies like renewables, electric vehicles, and nuclear power. Furthermore, Bloomberg reports that global investment in the energy transition surged by 17% last year, reaching a record $1.8 trillion, with this growth trend continuing. Former VettaFi financial futurist Dave Nadig said:\n\u201cIf you solely look at climate as your window, you\u2019ll probably not end up not owning a lot of energy companies, not owning a lot of miners [and] not owning a lot of steel companies. So, you end up with something that looks like services, healthcare, and technology, which is a very strong bet to take.\u201d\nThat said, U.S. funds with ESG goals seem to be losing popularity as of late. Despite the broader stock market\u2019s gains, assets in the sector have dropped to around $335 billion, down from a peak near $365 billion at the end of 2021. Political criticism of ESG in the country has also has led some investors to reconsider their strategies within the sector. Moreover, ESG stocks are also grappling with other significant challenges, such as a key climate regulation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that is currently under legal dispute, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s resistance to including environmental risks in global financial regulations.\nHowever, despite criticism labeling the ESG sector as \u201cwoke\u201d investing, many U.S. firms remain dedicated to ESG initiatives. Investor interest also remains somewhat robust, as these funds continue to attract attention for considering both financial performance and environmental, social, and governance factors. While there have been big outflows from the sector, many institutional investors are approaching climate risks and opportunities in their portfolios with a heightened sense of urgency, with an August analysis published in the Harvard Business Review showing that nearly three-quarters of the corporate climate commitments announced in 2021 had been fully or partially achieved. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are among the top global underwriters of green bonds this year, while Bank of America, alongside other prominent investment banking firms, recently sponsored ESG-focused conferences in New York and Chicago.\nWith that in mind, ESG funds saw strong performance in the first half of the year, largely driven by their substantial investments in technology stocks. Most ESG funds that aren\u2019t focused on renewable energy tend to allocate more to tech stocks while maintaining a lower exposure to oil and gas stocks. In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 rose by approximately 15%, and nearly 60% of this gain was driven by the majority of the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019, which are often among the largest holdings in ESG funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo create the list of top ESG stocks to buy now, we chose companies from the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF and ranked them by their percentage weight in the fund, listed in ascending order. In addition, we used hedge fund sentiments regarding each stock to illustrate how well these stocks hold up in the eyes of hedge fund investors.

Experts predict that its current-generation Hopper chips will continue to see strong sales through the end of the year, with Blackwell chips likely becoming a significant sales driver by then. Despite a reported delay in the release of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s GPU architecture, Goldman Sachs remains optimistic that management commentary and upcoming supply-chain data could boost NVIDIA\u2019s earnings outlook.\nStifel also maintained its Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares with a price target of $165.00 ahead of the company\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results. The firm is optimistic about the demand for NVIDIA\u2019s H-Series SKUs and expects that the company\u2019s July results and October guidance could exceed expectations.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).\u201d\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best ESG stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco ",
        "Text": "Over the last two years, the prospects of artificial intelligence (AI) have become a bellwether for the technology industry. Among a long list of AI investment opportunities, semiconductor companies have emerged as some of the most lucrative.\nSince ChatGPT took the world by storm in November 2022, shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) have gained a jaw-dropping 760% as of this writing. In fact, the company's market cap briefly eclipsed $3 trillion.\nIt really wasn't too long ago that Nvidia was seen as a niche opportunity among a broader sea of technology companies. And yet, today, Nvidia is the third-largest in the world as measured by market cap, making it more valuable than Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Berkshire Hathaway.\nWith AI looking like the next generational opportunity for investors, Nvidia may appear the most lucrative choice of all, given its influential role and seemingly unstoppable potential. However, a recent remark from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has me questioning just how much longer the stock can soar.\nLast week, investment bank Goldman Sachs hosted the Communacopia + Technology Conference, where analysts were granted rare access to Huang to ask questions related to Nvidia's product roadmap, customer use cases, and broader industry trends.\nConsidering Nvidia has consistently blown out Wall Street's expectations over the last couple of years, you'd think most questions presented to Huang would focus on the prospects of more record growth. But one analyst actually took a different approach: The analyst asked Huang what he's worried about despite Nvidia's market-leading position and strong secular tailwinds fueling its business.\nHere was Huang's response:\nWell, our company works with every AI company in the world today. We're working with every single data center in the world today. I don't know one data center, one cloud service provider, one computer maker we're not working with. And so what comes with that is ... [an] enormous responsibility and we have a lot of people on our shoulders and everybody is counting on us and demand is so great that delivery of our components and our technology and our infrastructure and software is really emotional for people, because it directly affects their revenues, it directly affects their competitiveness. And so we probably have more emotional customers today than \u2014 and deservedly so. And if we could fulfill everybody's needs, then the emotion would go away but it's very emotional. It's really tense. We've got a lot of responsibility on our shoulder and we're trying to do the best we can.\nI know that's a jam-packed, run-on sentence. And candidly, there are a lot of themes in there that suggest Nvidia is in a good spot.\nBut the explanation above doesn't inspire the same sense of confidence in me that it might for other investors. Instead, it makes me a little nervous.\nNvidia's roster of chipsets, called graphics processing units (GPUs), includes its highly touted A100, H100, and new Blackwell series. As it stands today, some industry research suggests Nvidia holds 88% of the AI chip market.\nHuang really wasn't exaggerating when he said, \"Everybody is counting on us.\" Considering the release of the Blackwell chips was recently delayed due to a design flaw, Huang's remarks about customers being emotional make a lot of sense.\nIt's these ideas that have me concerned. Nvidia is no longer just viewed as another semiconductor stock. Rather, the company itself is largely seen as a barometer for the health of the overall AI market. Given this change in perception and the pressure to deliver that comes with it, I'm beginning to think Nvidia's stock price action is increasingly vulnerable.\nSaid another way, even if Nvidia delivers a strong quarter of growth, investor expectations are becoming so sky-high that good may not be good enough. When you layer on top just how much influence Nvidia has in the chip space, it's natural to think it's only a matter of time before even the slightest hiccup could take a material toll on the share price.\nI cannot say with any justifiable certainty whether Nvidia stock is headed higher or not. What I do believe with strong conviction is that shares of Nvidia are unlikely to rise by another 700%. Even in the long run, I think such a move is doubtful.\nThere are already several reasons to be wary of Nvidia's long-term growth prospects. At the moment, nearly half of the company's revenue is concentrated in just four customers. Yet, many of these customers are spending significant sums to make their own chips and migrate away from Nvidia.\nThe combination of rising competition, decelerating revenue and margin trends, and the immense (and unrealistic) expectations that Nvidia will continue to deliver top-tier products and business results in perpetuity brings me to the opinion that Nvidia stock may have peaked.\nWhile further gains are probably in store, I think these will be short-lived. Ultimately, I think Nvidia stock will normalize sooner than many are anticipating. For that reason, investors should consider all pieces of the puzzle before pouring into the semiconductor darling going forward.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Tirthankar Chakraborty ",
        "Text": "On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates aggressively and penciled in further rate cuts by the end of the year. It slashed the benchmark interest rate by a half-point to 4.75-5% for the first time since March 2020.\nInterest rates have been hovering at a 23-year high to combat relentless price pressures. However, signs of inflationary pressure have ebbed recently, giving the Fed all the more reason to cut interest rates aggressively and let investors know that the central bank is not behind the curve.\nA lower interest rate scenario may lead to stock gains for major artificial intelligence (AI) tech players like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Micron Technology, Inc. MU. This is because interest rate cuts reduce their borrowing costs and boost profit margins. Interest rate cuts also don\u2019t disrupt the cash flows needed for growth initiatives to enhance shareholder\u2019s wealth.\nBy the way, the euphoria about the AI revolution hasn\u2019t faded. It\u2019s here to stay and should drive the prices of NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron northward. After all, NVIDIA provides technology for AI applications, Microsoft builds AI resources for its customers and Micron is a memory specialist. AI\u2019s data centers require a lot of memory.\nAccording to Statista, the AI industry is expected to grow beyond $184 billion in 2024 and continue to expand until 2030, with an estimated market size of $826 billion (read more: What AI Bubble? NVIDIA & 2 Other Chip Stocks With Strong Price Upside).\nEven so, let\u2019s look at other reasons why NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron\u2019s shares have more room to run. \nAccording to CEO Jensen Huang, as huge chunks of data are transferred from the central processing units to graphic processing units (GPU), NVIDIA will gain due to its bulk share in the GPU market. Precedence Research noted that the GPU market is expected to grow to $1,414.39 billion in 2034 from $75.77 billion in the current year at a CAGR of 13.8%.\nSince developers rely more on the CUDA software platform than Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u2019s AMD ROCm software platform, NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs have a wide competitive moat. NVIDIA\u2019s data center GPU business revenues were $26.2 billion in the second quarter, up 154% year over year. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.80 for NVDA\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) is up 76.1% from the prior year (read more: NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft\u2019s Azure and cloud services business has picked up steam, with revenues from this segment increasing 29% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud infrastructure unit is expanding faster than Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has dominated the cloud computing market for quite some time.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Azure could soon overtake AWS since it has grown from half the size of AWS in 2019 to about three quarters now. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.04 for MSFT\u2019s EPS is up 5% year over year (read more: Microsoft Unveils $60 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy MSFT Stock?).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIncreasing demand for Micron\u2019s high-bandwidth memory chips (HBM) has led the company to use its full production capacity and is expected to boost the bottom line. Management noted that revenues from the HBM market are estimated to be $86 billion by 2030 from $1.8 billion last year.\nNVIDIA\u2019s AI graphic cards also use Micron\u2019s HBM chips, so the demand is expected to improve. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 for MU\u2019s EPS is up 160.3% on a year-over-year basis (read more: Death Cross for MU Stock: Time to Buy Micron Based on Fundamentals?).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGiven the positives, well-known brokers have jacked up the average short-term price target of NVDA by 28.8% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $115.59. Analysts\u2019 highest price target is $200, an upside of 73%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nProminent brokers have also increased MSFT\u2019s average short-term price target by 14.8% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $435.15. The highest price target is $600, an upside of 37.9%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMU\u2019s average short-term price target, too, has been raised 74.4% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $88.73. The highest price target is $225, an upside of 153.6%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOver the past year, the shares of NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron have soared 168.4%, 34.3%, and 25.4%, respectively.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAll these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News You Shouldn't Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks you shouldn't miss.\nAI presents significant benefits for investors, primarily through increased efficiency, automation, and the potential for high returns in specific sectors. It leads to higher profitability and efficiency. For example, AI-driven automation enhances efficiency in trading, portfolio management, and operations, helping investors achieve better returns. According to a report by PwC, financial institutions that adopt AI could reduce operational costs by 22% in the short term, which directly improves profitability. Hedge funds, for instance, have seen an increase in efficiency, particularly in areas such as algorithmic trading and risk management. A report by McKinsey suggests that AI-driven trading algorithms can outperform traditional investment strategies by identifying patterns and trends that are hard for human analysts to spot. This advantage could increase returns by 2-3% annually, which can compound into significant gains over time.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nAI tools also provide real-time data analytics and insights, giving investors a competitive edge in making informed decisions. According to a study by Deloitte, 63% of financial executives believe that AI can dramatically improve investment decision-making by providing better market forecasts and risk assessments. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, allowing investors to capitalize on short-term market movements with greater precision. Similarly, the explosion of generative AI and machine learning has led to a surge in stocks related to AI technology. Several AI-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with opportunities for growth. For instance, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has returned close to 30% in the past year, significantly outperforming traditional tech funds.\nTom Kehoe, a top researcher at Alternative Investment Management Association, an investment firm in the United Kingdom, has emphasized that AI is poised to revolutionize investment management, offering greater efficiency and precision in decision-making. Similarly, Larry Fink, the CEO of investment titan BlackRock, believes that AI will be a transformative force for wealth management, allowing firms to personalize portfolios and scale operations efficiently, which in turn create immediate value for investors. Fink was quoted by Financial Times as saying that the collapse of productivity had been a central issue in the global economy. Per Fink, AI had the huge potential to increase productivity, and transform margins across sectors, as it may be the technology that brought down inflation.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the latest and most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The stock has ticked upwards in the past few days after a prolonged downward slide following the release of earnings that were overshadowed by slow growth and production delays to the latest Blackwell chips. However, recent remarks by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, during the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, in which he said that the new chips were in full production and the firm expected to start shipping them in the fourth quarter and ramp up from there. The start of Blackwell shipping would translate to around $10 billion in revenue for the chip firm, according to chip analysts.\nOverall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has gone from blowing away the stock market in the first half of the year to whipsawing back and forth on seemingly small news items.\nIt's unusual to see swings that amount to $200 billion in market value being added or taken away in just a single session. That's life for a stock worth nearly $3 trillion, though. Since Nvidia's stock hit an all-time high on June 20, it's moved up or down by 5% or more in 15 sessions, a reflection of the stock's own volatility and investor uncertainty around where Nvidia is heading.\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) superstar has also shown itself to be particularly sensitive to macroeconomic data as well as bets about the direction of interest rates and the greater economy. For example, Nvidia stock jumped 4.5% on Aug. 23 when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the \"time had come\" to lower interest rates. On Sept. 6, the stock pulled back 4% on a weak unemployment report, sparking concerns about the economy, and it jumped 8% on Sept. 11 as a cooler-than-expected inflation report reinforced confidence in an interest rate cut next week.\nClearly, Nvidia is sensitive to the economy's direction, and fears of a recession have threatened the stock in recent months as the unemployment rate is rising and consumer demand is weak.\nSo, how would Nvidia fare in a recession? The answer is more complicated than you might think.\nHistorically, the semiconductor sector is highly cyclical. Demand for chips goes through boom and bust cycles in line with the economy or a new kind of technology, and inventory can swing from a shortage to a glut quickly, influencing price and demand.\nThe broader semiconductor sector is just emerging from a downturn that was caused by oversupply of memory chips and others for the PC market as device sales boomed during the height of the pandemic and then pulled back.\nNvidia itself has gone through boom and bust cycles before. The stock soared during the pandemic as its chips were popular for crypto mining, but as Bitcoin prices plunged and tech stocks entered a bear market, Nvidia stock fell nearly 70% from its peak in 2021 to its trough in late 2022.\nThe stock went through a similar cycle in 2018 and 2019, falling nearly 60%.\nNvidia has put up unprecedented results in recent quarters with revenue more than tripling over four quarters, and profits soaring by as Nvidia's profit margins have expanded to greater than 60%.\nIts components, which are powering the AI revolution, are in demand from virtually every cloud infrastructure company and AI start-up. Alphabet co-founder Larry Page reportedly said he was willing to bankrupt the company to win the AI race, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also tipped his cap to Nvidia, saying it was vital for the company to maintain its supply of Nvidia GPUs.\nIn other words, demand for Nvidia's products is so strong and the companies buying them are so rich that the business should do fine in a recession -- it seems like it would take a severe economic crash to pause the AI race.\nEven Nvidia's own CEO, Jensen Huang, acknowledged this dynamic at a recent investor conference. Huang was asked at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference what he was most worried about. Most CEOs would probably say competition, macroeconomics, innovation, or something to that effect. Instead of discussing potential threats to Nvidia, he went in the opposite direction, saying:\nWe have a lot of people on our shoulders, and everybody is counting on us. Demand is so great that delivery of our components, our technology, infrastructure, and software is really emotional for people because it directly affects their revenues. It directly affects their competitiveness.\nRather than worry about demand as most CEOs might, Nvidia has the opposite problem. It's still struggling to meet overwhelming demand for its components nearly two years after the launch of ChatGPT. Huang is worried about pleasing his customers and the pressure on his company to deliver as Nvidia products have become so precious because the stakes are so high in the AI race.\nDespite the business's strong position, investors aren't treating Nvidia any differently from a typical semiconductor stock. Based on its price action, they continue to believe that it's highly sensitive to the macro-level economy and a possible recession, but that doesn't seem true of the business right now given the imbalance between supply and demand, the company's soaring revenue growth, and comments from top CEOs like Meta Platforms' Mark Zuckerberg, who have said that the risk of underinvesting in AI is much greater than overinvesting.\nInvestors can't control whether Nvidia falls on downbeat economic news, but they can do something else: Take advantage of the misalignment between the strength of the business and the volatility in the stock and buy the dip in Nvidia if it pulls back on recession fears.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +11.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 12.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.72 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +80%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.5%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +112.3%. This estimate has changed +2.5% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.52 indicates a change of +27.5% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.1%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nvidia.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $32.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +79.8%. The $122.19 billion and $165.65 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +100.6% and +35.6%, respectively.\nNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +122.4%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.27 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.72%. The EPS surprise was +6.25%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Trading Up Today",
        "Author": "  Anthony Lee ",
        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 5.2% in the morning session as markets roared back after an initially muted response to the Fed's rate cut, which sparked a renewed appetite for risk assets. While investors were expecting a reduction in rates from the US central bank, there was a bit of back and forth on whether the cut would be 25bps (a quarter percent) or 50bps (half a percent).\nThe Fed ended up slashing its policy rate by 50bps (0.5%) to 4.75%-5.00%. This marks the first rate reduction in roughly four years. As a reminder, the Fed\u2014under Chair Jerome Powell\u2014began raising rates to tackle inflation coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic when a confluence of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending caused inflation to run hot.\nLooking forward, the Fed signaled that more cuts are possible in 2024/25. Putting it all together, the announcement and outlook provided a breath of fresh air and a clearer view of the Fed's monetary policy stance, which the market has been waiting for with bated breath. If there's anything the market doesn't like, it's uncertainty.\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. The result of lower interest rates, all else equal, is higher stock valuations. This is especially true for higher-growth stocks such as those in the technology sector, where the current value depends more on cash flows many years out in the future.\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nNvidia\u2019s shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 24 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today\u2019s move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 8 days ago, when the company gained 6.8% as markets rebounded (Nasdaq up 1.8%, S&P 500 up 0.8%) after shaking off the initial negative reaction to the August inflation report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report revealed that CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) for the month of August 2024 came in line with expectations, growing 0.2% month on month.\nA concerning aspect of the report lies in the core CPI (which excludes food and energy prices), which revealed a 0.3% increase from the previous month, slightly exceeding the expected 0.2% increase. Despite this, annual inflation seemed to be easing, rising by 2.5%, the lowest level since February 2021.\nNvidia is up 147% since the beginning of the year, but at $119.19 per share it is still trading 12.1% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $26,945.\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 23, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Salesforce, Inc. CRM, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s AMD.\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nNVIDIA Corp.has crushed bubble fears and has seen a meteoric rise in the past few years amid the advent of artificial intelligence (AI).\nCEO Jensen Huang, however, believes NVIDIA's growth story is just beginning, while the Federal Reserve's recent jumbo interest rate cuts should help the company access cheaper capital. So, is this the most opportune moment to place bets on the stock? Let's take a closer look.\nIn Wednesday's concluded policy meeting, the Fed trimmed interest rates by half a point to support economic growth and stabilize the labor market. For the first time in four years, the Fed eased its monetary policy and kept the interest rates at 4.75% to 5%.\nThe Summary of Economic Projections further showed that most Fed officials expect another 50-basis point rate cut by the end of the year, followed by 100 and 50-basis point rate cuts in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\nA lower interest rate environment bodes well for NVIDIA since the semiconductor behemoth's cash flows essential for growth initiatives aren't affected. At the same time the company's cost of borrowings gets reduced, eventually boosting the profit margins vis-\u00e0-vis the share price (read more: NVIDIA & 2 Other AI Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates).\nNVIDIA stock has always performed well after interest rate cut announcements. As a result, the company's share price increased nearly 4% on Thursday.\nAccording to Dow Jones Market Data, the NVIDIA stock gained, on average, 6.9%, 16.6%, 16.7%, and 20.7% in the month, three months, six months and 12 months following a rate cut.\nOn the other hand, going back to the 1990s, the S&P 500 Index, on average, gained only 2.9% in the 12 months after a rate cut, indicating NVIDIA stock has more upside than most of the listed stocks in the broader index.\nIt's not just the long-awaited big Fed rate cut that pushed the NVIDIA stock higher yesterday. CEO Jensen Huang's encouraging comments on the AI movement at the Dreamforce technological gathering hosted by Salesforce, Inc. also had investors pouring into NVDA stock.\nHuang said the AI industry is transforming from tools to an industry of skills, and there is a huge opportunity in the field of AI that NVIDIA can exploit. This has given investors all the more reason to believe that NVIDIA's stunning growth isn't over yet. Even though NVIDIA stock has fallen off its record highs, its shares have outpaced the Semiconductor - General industry this year (+138.1% vs +89%).\nNVIDIA's advanced chips are needed to train large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini and function AI interfaces. NVIDIA stock, thus, is expected to gain as the AI industry is projected to grow from around $184 billion this year to $826 billion by 2030, according to Statista.\nMoreover, AI is here to stay as its foundation is based on practical applications, unlike the dot com era when companies were involved in speculative businesses (read more: What AI Bubble? NVIDIA & 2 Other Chip Stocks With Strong Price Upside).\nEncouraging developments on Blackwell chip production, dominance in the graphic processing units (GPU) market and capability to generate profits consistently also act as tailwinds for the NVIDIA stock.\nHuang confirmed that NVIDIA has ramped up the production of cutting-edge Blackwell chips as demand has soared among the likes of Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp.. After all, the Blackwell B200 chip has more AI throughput than the current Hopper H100 chip.\nMeanwhile, NVIDIA accounts for the bulk of the share in the GPU market as more developers depend on the CUDA software platform, unlike Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s not-so-efficient ROCm software platform. NVIDIA, thus, is well-poised to make the most of the rise in the GPU market, which is likely to expand to $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion this year, per Precedence Research.\nFundamentally, the NVIDIA stock is sound. This is because its return on equity (ROE) is around 120% compared with the industry's 73.2%. An ROE above 100% indicates that the company's net income is more than the equity or that it has given a strong performance.\nGiven the positives, things are looking brighter for the NVIDIA stock. Prominent brokers have increased NVDA's average short-term price target by 31.3% from the stock's last closing price of $113.37. The highest price target is $200, an upside of 76.4%.\nHowever, the NVDA stock is still pricey. Per the price/earnings, the NVDA stock, presently, trades at 42.0X forward earnings. However, NVDA's rivals or the peer group's forward earnings multiple is 16.4X.\nTherefore, investors should wait for the right entry point to buy the stock so it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. Those who have invested in NVIDIA should stick to it since the stock has a strong upside. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

The semiconductor company's share price was down 8.7% as of 2:15 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price is falling in response to rising concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. News out of China and other geopolitical dynamics are also prompting sell-offs for Nvidia and other chip stocks today.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor is expected to release its latest employment data on Friday, and Wall Street is seeing an uptick in bearish sentiment ahead of the report. Investors have been looking forward to interest-rate cuts that are expected to be delivered by the Federal Reserve this month, and the rate reduction could be larger than many analysts initially expected. But there's a catch.\nSome analysts now expect that the Fed will cut interest rates by a full point this year. If so, that could be a sign that the central banking authority believes the economy is on track for a recession. Investors are bracing for a worrying jobs report at the end of this week, and Nvidia and other high-profile growth stocks are seeing big valuation pullbacks.\nIn an interview on Sunday, Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te said that China should also move to reclaim land from Russia if it wants to officially make Taiwan its territory. Rather than suggesting that China should take back Russian land that used to be within its own borders, Lai was making a statement about whether the Chinese government was being logically consistent in some of its stated reasons for plans to exert greater control over Taiwan. Nevertheless, it looks like the comments from Taiwan's president are highlighting the risk that China could invade Taiwan at some point in the not-too-distant future.\nWhile the Chinese government has long made claims that Taiwan is already part of its territory, the contention has taken on added importance in light of the crucial role that Taiwan plays in semiconductor manufacturing and artificial intelligence trends. The island nation is home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- the leading contract manufacturer of semiconductors that's responsible for the fabrication of advanced chips for AI applications.

The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia.

        "Text": "Undoubtedly, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has already seen its stock soar. As the chipmaker became the face of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, its share price rose, and it's now up by more than 600% since the beginning of 2023. Yet that wasn't the first time the company's market cap multiplied in a relatively short period. Between early 2020 and late 2021, Nvidia's stock gained more than 400%.\nI think it may be some time before we see the company make another run on par with either of those. To be sure, Nvidia is in a strong position to continue growing its market-leading data center segment for some time. Major customers such as Meta Platforms and Alphabet are showing no signs of slowing their massive spending on data center infrastructure. That being said, its growth will likely be slower than what fueled its most recent run.\nWe're already seeing this play out. As the graph below shows, year-over-year quarterly revenue growth is decelerating. Don't get me wrong -- its 122% growth in Q2 was still incredible, but it was less than half what the previous two quarters delivered, and the company is projecting roughly 80% year-over-year growth for the current quarter.\nIn Q2, Nvidia's automotive arm produced $346 million in revenue. That's not bad, but it's a far cry from where it could be in the future. In fact, CEO Jensen Huang believes it to be a $300 billion market. This would include the software and hardware that will be embedded both in the cars themselves and in data centers that will be integral to powering an autonomous vehicle network. Huang says he believes this will be \"one of the largest AI industries in the world.\"\nOf course, we should take a CEO's words with a grain of salt when they're talking about their company's future opportunities, but Huang's estimation is in line with analysis from respected research firms. How long it will be before the technology matures to a point where it can really take off is the bigger question. It may be some time before we have truly autonomous cars on the road, but there has been a lot of progress toward that goal of late. I think it's more than possible that this market will begin to explode before the end of the decade.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the new buzzword that is attracting the attention of almost everyone on Wall Street. The sector, characterized by rapid growth, significant investment, and intense competition, has witnessed a surge in venture capital (VC) funding over the past few months. In 2023, global VC investment in AI startups exceeded $94 billion. This surge in funding reflects the strong belief that these investors have in the transformative potential of AI across various industries. Merger and acquisition activity in the field is also on the rise, with more than 1,100 such deals in 2023 alone. Larger tech companies are actively acquiring AI startups to bolster their capabilities in the shortest time possible.\nSome sector-specific numbers highlight the AI potential in minute detail. For example, in the healthcare universe, the AI healthcare market is projected to reach $102 billion by 2028, with startups focusing on diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. In finance, AI-driven financial services are expected to reach a market value of $26.67 billion by 2026, with startups focusing on fintech, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading. In the retail world, AI is revolutionizing through personalized shopping experiences and supply chain optimization, with the sector projected to grow at a 34.4% CAGR by 2030.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nHedge fund interest in AI has increased in the past few months, an indication of the long-term growth potential of the industry. During routine interviews with the media, investor conferences, and through their 13F activity, hedge fund managers have detailed their bullish views on AI. For example, Bill Ackman, the chief Pershing Square Capital Management, has said that AI startups represent the next frontier in technology, offering unparalleled opportunities for innovation. He adds that the key is finding those with a clear vision and the ability to execute in a rapidly evolving landscape.\nSimilarly, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates is of the opinion that the impact of AI on industries is undeniable, and the startups driving this change are in a unique position to capitalize on it. Dalio adds, however, that it's crucial to invest in those that are building sustainable, ethical models, as they will be the long-term winners. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corporation believes that AI startups are not just about tech but about transforming entire industries. He notes that the challenge is in navigating the hype and identifying the true innovators who have the potential to disrupt established markets.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The stock has been in the spotlight over the past few days after topping analyst expectations on earnings and guidance in the latest quarterly report. This outperformance, coming in the wake of investor concerns around the production ramp for the latest AI chip named Blackwell, outlines the solid demand for non-Blackwell chips that the company markets, the most notable of which is Hopper. Wall Street analysts reiterated their bullish forecasts for the chipmaker following the earnings report, with Daniel Ives from Wedbush leading this charge.\nIves hailed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the torch bearer of the AI revolution, with the results and guidance a drop-the-mic moment. Ives, who has been particularly bullish on the company in the past few months, underlined that AI GPU demand was way outstripping supply for NVIDIA at this juncture, and Wall Street should view these results as a very bullish indicator for the broader tech sector with more shock and awe rather than a shrug of the shoulders.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks you should not have missed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Where Will Nvidia Be in 5 Years?",
        "Author": "  Beth McKenna, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is red-hot. The artificial intelligence (AI) giant's stock has returned 141% so far this year through Aug. 30, making it the top performer on the S&P 500 index. The stock has also been a gargantuan winner over the long run. It's returned 25,580% over the last decade, transforming a $1,000 investment into $256,800. (For context, the S&P 500 returned 19.5% and 239%, respectively, over these periods.)\nInvestors, of course, are concerned with Nvidia's future. Nobody can predict the future accurately, particularly in the fast-evolving technology world, but with a solid knowledge of Nvidia and the environment in which it operates, we can make some educated predictions.\nHere are some predictions for what Nvidia's business will look like in five years.\nFor reference, Huang turned 61 earlier this year, according to public records, which would make him 66 in the summer of 2029.\nAs someone who regularly listens to Nvidia's earnings calls, it's obvious to me that Huang loves his work. Yet, it's grueling being the CEO of a massive company, particularly one that operates in the ultra-competitive cutting-edge tech realm. Huang has been leading the company since he cofounded it in 1993.\nIt would be fantastic for investors if Huang would lead Nvidia for as long as possible, as he's the company's No. 1 competitive advantage. (Maybe he could whip up a digital twin of himself using Nvidia's Omniverse platform!) Realistically, I think investors will be lucky if he continues as CEO for another four or five years, assuming he remains healthy enough. So, I'm going with the prediction that in five years, Huang will have recently stepped aside as CEO, or be on the verge of doing so. Hopefully, he'll transition to the role of chairman of the board, again, assuming he remains able.\nThis topic begs the question: Does Nvidia have a CEO succession plan in place?\nIt's widely accepted as fact that Nvidia has well over a 90% share of the market for advanced AI graphics processing unit (GPU) chips and more than an 80% share of the overall advanced AI chip market. (The latter category mainly includes custom chips -\u2013 or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) -- that many of the big tech companies have developed or are developing for specific use cases.)\nCurrently, the bulk of the most advanced AI chips are found in data centers, but they will eventually become more common in \"edge applications,\" such as in cars and robots.\nThe type of dominance Nvidia enjoys is a wonderful thing for investors given how fast the AI chip market is growing and is projected to continue to grow. This market was already growing at a fast pace, which became a turbocharged pace with the advent of generative AI. This is the tech that has wowed the technology world since OpenAI launched its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022.\nIn its fiscal year 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's data center revenue skyrocketed 217% year over year -- or more than tripled -- to $47.5 billion. In its second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended July 28, 2024), which it reported last week, data center revenue soared 154% year over year to $26.3 billion, accounting for 87% of the company's total revenue of $30 billion.\nThe bulk of data center revenue is generated from AI chips and related technology (software, networking equipment, and other hardware) that together enable AI applications. Nvidia is much more than simply a chip company. Indeed, one of its biggest competitive advantages comes from its huge ecosystem of developers using its CUDA software to develop AI applications.\nLisa Su, who is the CEO of Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, projects the global market for chips to accelerate AI processing in data centers will reach $400 billion in revenue by 2027, which equates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 72.7%. Barring severe anti-competitive regulatory actions against Nvidia, I think it has the potential to capture the majority of this total addressable market (TAM) for a good number of years, with AMD, Intel, and makers of custom ASICs -- such as Broadcom -- combined capturing a lesser share.\nIn 2029, I don't think fully autonomous vehicles will be legal across the U.S., but that they will be close to being so. The closer we get to legalization across the U.S. (and other countries), the more money Nvidia should make from this gigantic secular growth trend.\nThis comment from CFO Colette Kress during last week's fiscal Q2 earnings call summarizes how dominant Nvidia's AI-powered autonomous vehicle platform, DRIVE, is in this space:\nAutomotive was a key growth driver for the quarter as every automaker developing autonomous vehicle technology is using Nvidia in their data centers. Automotive will drive multibillion dollars in revenue across on-prem[ises] and cloud consumption and will grow as next-generation AV [autonomous vehicle] models require significantly more compute. [Emphasis mine]\nIn my March 2020 article on the same topic as this one, I predicted that \"Nvidia is incredibly innovative, so there seems a great chance that the company will introduce at least one major new technology that takes nearly everyone by surprise.\"\nThis prediction came to fruition in spades. Since that time, Nvidia launched the Omniverse, which enables companies to develop their own metaverses, and a slew of major innovations for enabling generative AI, a tech that nobody or just about nobody heard of in 2020. This is the nature of disruptive technology.\nSo, I feel extremely confident that within the next five years, Nvidia will have at least a few huge businesses -- meaning multibillion-dollar ones -- that are entirely new and that just about nobody (with the possible exception of some research scientists) can predict now.\nThere is no way that anyone can accurately predict Nvidia's stock price in five years. A big unknown is the overall market performance over this period, which would greatly affect Nvidia stock's performance. A recession during this period is possible, for instance.\nThat said, given the predictions in this article, I feel confident that Nvidia stock will outperform the market over the next five years.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If you had invested $5,000 in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) 10 years ago, your investment would be worth more than $1.24 million today. The chipmaker minted a lot of millionaires, as its sales of gaming and data center graphics processing units (GPUs) skyrocketed.\nBut with a market cap of $2.9 trillion, Nvidia is now the third largest publicly traded company in the world after Apple and Microsoft. Could it turn a new $5,000 investment into $1 million again over the next 10 years?\nNvidia is the world's largest producer of discrete GPUs for high-end PCs and servers. Its GPUs can be used to process high-end graphics in video games, power photo and video editing software, mine cryptocurrencies, and process complex artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.\nIn the past, Nvidia generated most of its revenue from the PC market. But over the past few years, its data center business eclipsed its PC gaming business as companies scrambled to upgrade their servers to handle new AI applications. All of the world's leading AI companies -- including Microsoft, OpenAI, and Alphabet's Google -- now use Nvidia's chips.\nFrom fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), Nvidia's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31% as its earnings per share (EPS) rose at a CAGR of 50%. Some of that growth was initially driven by the expansion of its gaming GPU business (which was aided by the booming crypto mining market), but the data center business eventually became its core growth engine. That's why Nvidia's growth accelerated significantly in fiscal 2024 as the AI market exploded.\nMetric\nFY 2020\nFY 2021\nFY 2022\nFY 2023\nFY 2024\nRevenue growth\n(7%)\n53%\n61%\n0%\n126%\nEPS growth\n(35%)\n55%\n129%\n(56%)\n600%\nData source: Nvidia. Chart by author.\nFrom fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024, the percentage of Nvidia's revenue that came from data center chips doubled from 39% to 78%. That ratio rose to 87% in the first half of fiscal 2025 -- so it's becoming an all-in play on AI-oriented data center chips.\nThe bulls believe Nvidia's growth spurt will continue as the market's demand for new AI chips outstrips supply. They believe the company's gross margins -- which rose from 62% in fiscal 2020 to 72.7% in fiscal 2024 -- will continue to grow as it exercises nearly unmatched pricing power in the booming market. They also say the company's stock looks reasonably valued at 32 times next year's earnings.\nThe bears expect Nvidia's growth to cool as the AI hype dies down, cheaper competitors like AMD gain ground, and tighter export curbs throttle its sales to China. Many of Nvidia's top customers have also been developing their own AI accelerator chips to reduce their long-term dependence on the chipmaker.\nThey'll also note that Nvidia's insiders sold 10x as many shares as they bought over the past 12 months -- so its upside potential might be limited.\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 50% and 56%, respectively. Most of that growth should be driven by the red-hot generative AI market, which Fortune Business Insights estimates will grow at a CAGR of 40% from 2024 to 2032.\nIf Nvidia matches Wall Street's expectations, grows its EPS at a slower CAGR of 30% from fiscal 2027 to fiscal 2035, and still trades at 30 times earnings, its stock price could rally 840% to $1,110 and lift its market cap to $27 trillion by 2034.\nBut even in that bullish best-case scenario, Nvidia would only turn a $5,000 investment into $47,000. To make $1 million again, you would need to invest about $106,000 today. Therefore, Nvidia might still help you become a millionaire if you can afford to invest that much cash in a single stock -- but it probably won't replicate its gains from the past 10 years.\nIn reality, Nvidia's growth could cool over the next decade as the AI market matures and new competitors carve up the market. Its growth could possibly be hampered by a global recession or other unpredictable macro or regulatory headwinds. Investors should keep all those risks in mind instead of assuming Nvidia's hot stock will continue its historic rally.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

This is one reason owning shares in both is a great way to invest in the secular trend of AI.\nHowever, if you had to choose just one of these semiconductor giants to invest in, which would make the better AI investment? Here's a breakdown of each to arrive at an answer.\nBroadcom tackles the AI market with an array of products servicing many tech industries, including data centers, wireless networks, and industrial applications. The company's AI strategy involves a combination of hardware and software to help customers meet their needs for AI infrastructure.\nOn the hardware side, Broadcom's products include AI accelerators, an essential component to speed up AI computer processing. Its business building custom AI accelerators grew year over year by more than 3 times in its fiscal third quarter, ended Aug. 4.\nThanks to demand for its AI-related products, the company's semiconductor division saw fiscal Q3 sales grow to $7.3 billion, up from $6.9 billion in the previous year.\nOn the software side, Broadcom acquired VMware toward the end of 2023, which is why its software division's Q3 revenue zoomed up to $5.8 billion from $1.9 billion in the prior year. The addition of VMware enabled total Q3 revenue to grow 47% year over year to $13.1 billion.\nBroadcom is using the VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) platform to target businesses wanting a private cloud, or a hybrid of private and public clouds, for their AI systems. The strategy is succeeding. VCF represented 80% of VMware's products booked in Q3.\nBroadcom exited its fiscal third quarter with respectable financials, such as free cash flow (FCF) of $4.8 billion. Its balance sheet included total assets of $168 billion, with $10 billion of that in cash and equivalents. Total liabilities were $102.3 billion, with $70 billion of that in debt.\nNvidia's AI success centers around its graphics processing unit (GPU), which is the heart of an AI system's ability to execute complex computations. The company also provides a comprehensive suite of software and other services, such as a robotics platform, to help businesses harness AI.\nThe semiconductor giant pioneered the GPU in 1999, steadily improving it over the years. Now, Nvidia's chips are the preferred choice for the AI computing industry.\nThe company continues to evolve its processors, with its new Blackwell GPUs ramping up production this year. According to Nvidia, Blackwell is the world's largest, most powerful GPU, housing over 200 billion transistors.\nIts GPU leadership in AI enabled Nvidia to hit a record $30 billion in revenue during its fiscal second quarter, ended July 28, a 122% increase from a year ago. The company expects sales to keep growing, forecasting fiscal Q3 revenue to reach $32.5 billion, up from the prior year's $18.1 billion.\nNvidia's AI strategy includes extending its GPU strength into various industries, such as automotive, to enable self-driving vehicles. In addition, its CEO, Jensen Huang, believes the cloud computing market, worth nearly $600 billion in 2023, will transition existing infrastructure to support AI systems. This would be a massive market opportunity for chipmakers such as Nvidia.\nAdding to the company's investment appeal, Nvidia's financials are excellent. Its fiscal Q2 FCF was $13.5 billion. Its Q2 balance sheet included $85.2 billion in total assets, with $34.8 billion of that in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Total liabilities were $27.1 billion, with $8.5 billion in debt.\nBecause the AI market is large and growing, both Broadcom and Nvidia should continue to see rising sales. But between the two, Nvidia experienced the largest revenue growth this past year as AI took off, illustrating the customer demand for its products.\nAnother factor to consider with each stock is their price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), a widely used metric to assess valuation. Broadcom's P/E multiple of 141 is far higher than the 54 for Nvidia shares at the time of this writing, indicating Nvidia is the better value.\nCurrently, both Broadcom and Nvidia shares are below their 52-week highs. But Nvidia's market leadership in AI chips, strong financials, and superior valuation compared to Broadcom make it the better long-term investment between these two semiconductor titans.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, during an interview with CNBC last month, called the decline in Mag. 7 stocks after Q2 earnings representative of a \u201cfundamental shift\u201d in the industry.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s popular to talk about AI because these stocks are driving the market, but at a certain point, you want to get a return on all of this money you are investing. And if your forward revenue estimate is going lower not higher but your CapEx is going up, at some point those two things are going to collide.\u201d\nNiles said that major tech companies went through a \u201cdigestion\u201d period after seeing huge returns during the COVID-19 pandemic days, and he expects the same to happen as we move into the next year.\nThe analyst said that on an equal-weighted basis, the broader market is up when compared with Mag. 7 stocks. He recommended investors to buy the stocks that would benefit from rate cuts. These include consumer staples, utilities, telecom services, etc.\nNiles said the other 493 companies could drive the market to new \u201call-time record highs.\u201d\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI trending stocks that are moving after latest analyst ratings and earnings.

If you look at CapEX spending over the last two years and you see Nvidia\u2019s revenues, Nvidia\u2019s revenues last year grew over a 100%, this year they are gonna grow over a 100%,\u00a0 I think what you are gonna see next year is a dramatic slowdown not only from the spending from hyperscalers but also in Nvidia\u2019s revenues as those hyperscalers grow into all of this money that they have spent that\u2019s not actually generating an increase in their revenue.\u201d\nWhat Niles is saying is not new. After Nvidia\u2019s latest quarterly report, here is what InsiderMonkey\u2019s Research Director Inan Dogan\u00a0wrote in a report:\nNvidia\u2019s market cap before today\u2019s earnings report was $3.1 trillion. This means investors expect NVDA to earn around $140 billion per year once it becomes a more mature company like Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) which is currently trading at a forward P/E multiple of 21. NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s quarterly revenue and profit were $30 billion and $16.6 billion respectively though. Is it reasonable to assume that NVDA\u2019s quarterly profit can go from $16.6 billion today to $35 billion in a few years and then continue to grow at the same rate that GOOGL\u2019s quarterly profit is growing?\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIf Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA\u2019s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year.

A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies \u2014 especially generative AI \u2014 has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nFinancial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs.\nThe retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Four weeks after US stocks buckled amid a global flight from risk assets, chipmakers touched off another bout of equities selling when a pair of industry analysts rekindled worries that the mania surrounding artificial intelligence had gone too far.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWorld's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It\nThe Plan for the World\u2019s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation\nMadrid to Ban E-Scooter Rentals, Following Lead Set in Paris\nThe Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office\nNvidia Corp. shares tumbled 9.5%, wiping out $278.9 billion in the biggest loss of value ever for a US stock. It is now down 14% in the three sessions since it reported earnings that failed to live up to lofty expectations. All 30 members of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index sank at least 5.4%, with On Semiconductor, KLA Corp. and Monolithic Power Systems Inc. down more than 9%. The Nasdaq 100 sank almost 3.2%.\nListen to the Bloomberg Daybreak Europe podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\nNvidia shares lost another 2% in late trading after the US Justice Department sent subpoenas to it and other companies as it seeks evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws.\nThere were other reasons for the bleak start to what is historically a volatile month for stocks. Worries about China\u2019s growth shook commodities markets from oil to copper. US manufacturing data came in light and showed an uptick in prices paid, a potentially worrying sign for inflation hawks. But most catalyzing for the tech rout were the fresh warnings that AI\u2019s promise to rewire global economies was far from being realized, making it hard to justify lofty valuations.\nThat was the gist of views expressed in separate commentaries from JPMorgan Asset Management and BlackRock Investment Institute. Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at JPAM, warned that spending on AI won\u2019t be justified unless demand for AI services from companies outside of tech starts to increase. For Jean Boivin head of BlackRock Investment, \u201cpatience is needed\u201d before AI takes off, a process of \u201cyears, not quarters.\u201d\nThose warnings, of course, aren\u2019t new. Alphabet Inc. shares got hit in July after it reported a spike in AI spending with no promise of a commensurate bump in profits, prompting a rotation out of big tech. But the two latest cautions landed in a market that rallied to just short of records in late August, largely on the promise that the US economy won\u2019t crater before the Federal Reserve delivers rate cuts later this month.\n\u201cAre we actually going to stick this soft landing, or are we going to get some type of a report later this week that shows unemployment is starting to rise substantially?\u201d said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re starting to see a lot of this volatility coincide, and it\u2019s just hitting the most overvalued sectors first, and people are starting to look for actual earnings growth, real revenues on the balance sheet. And more importantly than anything, really stable forward guidance.\u201d\nThe Cboe Voalitlity Index jumped above 20 as the S&P 500 dropped more than 2%, with all but two sectors lower. Like in early August, the selloff spread to other assets. Oil sank 4% and Treasury yields dropped as investors sought havens.\nThe damage done in the chip sector was extensive, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index dropping the most since March 2020. Intel Corp., whose shares are the second-worst performing in the Philadelphia semiconductor index this year, fell 8.8%. Chip equipment maker Applied Materials Inc. fell 7%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world\u2019s biggest contract manufacturer of chips, dropped roughly the same.\nAlphabet, Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. lost at least 1.9% as the pain spread to the biggest tech companies looking to reshape the economy with AI.\n\u201cOutside of the big tech companies buying among themselves, we haven\u2019t really seen AI spread out across the economy,\u201d Paul Nolte, market strategist and senior wealth manager at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management, said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a big question about the ROI from all this spending. And if you go back to the dot-com era, the first winners of the internet weren\u2019t always the final winners. We\u2019re not yet at a place, in terms of valuations, where I\u2019d want to buy this dip.\u201d\nWhile the Aug. 5 market rout rattled investors around the globe, equities bounced back almost immediately, adding more than 5% through the end of the month. Nvidia itself was among the leaders of that rebound, but as the Fed signaled unequivocally that it intends to cut rates, the rally was especially broad.\nThe near-term calendar promises some key economic data releases, especially Friday\u2019s US payrolls report, that will solidify bets on the Fed\u2019s path. But traders will have to wait three weeks for confirmation.\n\u201cWith equities sharply off the August lows as we enter a well-known period of weak seasonality, and with the first rate cut widely expected and arguably already priced in, it\u2019s not too surprising to see some de-risking as investors await more data/clarity,\u201d Christopher Jacobson, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna International Group.\n--With assistance from Natalia Kniazhevich and Katrina Compoli.\n(A prior version corrected the direction of Treasury yields in seventh paragraph and size of Microsoft loss in eighth.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\u2018They Have Stolen Our Business\u2019: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms\nHoward Lutnick Emerges as Trump\u2019s No. 1 Salesman on Wall Street\nHow Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company\u2019s Janky Software\nThe Average American Eats 42 Pounds of Cheese a Year, and That Number Could Go Up\nJustice Is Beside the Point in America\u2019s Immigration Courts\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other high volume stocks.\nOn September 18, the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing benchmark rates by half a percentage point to counter a potential labor market slowdown. This adjustment brings the federal funds rate to 4.75% to 5%. Aside from the emergency rate cuts during the pandemic, the last time the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) made a half-point reduction was during the 2008 global financial crisis. Following the decision, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made the following remarks:\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with this inflation. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do, and I think you could take today\u2019s action as a sign of our strong commitment to achieve that goal.\"\nThe post-meeting statement emphasized that the Federal Reserve has grown more confident in inflation moving sustainably toward the 2% target. It\u00a0believes the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are now roughly balanced. Wall Street expects that the ensuing rate cuts will enable well-established, financially stable companies to boost spending and investments, potentially driving up their stock prices through the remainder of 2024 and into early 2025. Similarly, Wells Fargo analysts suggest that the global economy stands to benefit as many major central banks have already announced or are expected to announce rate cuts. However, not everyone is optimistic. Billionaire investor Ray Dalio highlighted that the U.S. economy continues to grapple with an \"enormous amount of debt.\" During an interview, he pointed out that the Federal Reserve faces the challenge of maintaining interest rates high enough to benefit creditors, while not raising them so much that they become burdensome for debtors. Dalio described this as a difficult \"balancing act\".\nOn another front, the Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index dropped to 98.7 in September, down from 105.6 in August, marking the largest one-month decline since August 2021. This was below the Dow Jones forecast of 104 and significantly lower than the pre-pandemic level of 132.6 recorded in February 2020. All five components of the index saw declines, with the most significant drop occurring among those aged 35-54 and earning less than $50,000. The last time the index fell this sharply was when inflation was starting its rise to a 40-year high. Commenting on the sentiment shift, Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, noted:\n\u201cConsumers\u2019 assessments of current business conditions turned negative while views of the current labor market situation softened further. Consumers were also more pessimistic about future labor market conditions and less positive about future business conditions and future income.\u201d\nWithin a complex economic landscape marked by mixed signals across sectors, investor sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with market participants closely watching economic indicators and Fed policies to identify future trends. With this in mind, we present a list of the 10 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nOur Methodology\nWe used stock screeners to identify stocks that met specific criteria as of September 23. Our selection criteria was focused on stocks with notable market activity, including a 3-month average trading volume exceeding 5 million shares. We also considered companies with a quarterly revenue growth rate of over 15%.

        "Text": "Semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. In fact, analysts estimate its graphics processing units account for up to 95% of AI chip sales. But history is full of cautionary tales about the downfall of dominant brands that failed to maintain their technological leadership.\nIBM was once a highly esteemed computing company due to its mainframes and storage solutions, but it failed to innovate around cloud computing and PCs. Cisco was briefly the most valuable company in the world, back when the internet buildout drove demand for its networking products, but it no longer ranks among the top 50 because it failed to innovate.\nThose are just two examples from a long list that includes AOL, BlackBerry, Blockbuster, Kodak, and MySpace. To be clear, Nvidia is in no immediate danger of joining that list, but history says shareholders would be foolish to dismiss the idea completely. Indeed, recent warnings from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) make it clear that Nvidia is not immune to competition.\nHere are the important details.\nEarlier this year, Apple announced a set of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities for iOS and macOS devices called Apple Intelligence. Features include drafting and revising text, generating images, and summarizing notifications, as well as a more capable version of the personal assistant Siri. Apple Intelligence will launch in late October.\nIn July, Apple published a technical paper stating, \"Apple Intelligence consists of multiple highly capable generative models that are fast, efficient, specialized for our users' everyday tasks, and can adapt on the fly for their current activity.\" The paper also detailed how two of those models -- one that runs on devices for simple tasks, and another that runs in private data centers for more sophisticated tasks -- were trained.\nImportantly, Apple did not use Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) to develop its large language models. It used custom silicon called tensor processing units (TPUs) designed by Alphabet's Google and Broadcom. Notably, Broadcom is also helping other companies design custom AI chips, including Meta Platforms, OpenAI, and ByteDance, according to JPMorgan Chase.\nHere's the bottom line: Apple's decision to use TPUs rather than GPUs to train its AI models is a warning that viable alternatives to Nvidia exist. The relative importance of that decision is yet to be determined. If Apple Intelligence is glitchy, it may turn into a cautionary tale about what happens when companies stray from the industry standard. But if Apple Intelligence is well received by consumers, Apple's decision to use TPUs may inspire other companies to do the same.\nAlphabet's Google is not the only public cloud to develop custom AI silicon. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has done the same thing. Its custom chips -- Trainium for AI training and Inferentia for AI inference -- are not designed to outshine Nvidia GPUs on performance alone, but rather to give customers a more cost effective alternative.\nAlphabet and Amazon have deep partnerships with Nvidia. Both companies offer compute instances powered by Nvidia GPUs and that will not change anytime soon. Nvidia GPUs are the gold standard in data center accelerators, so it would be nonsensical to not offer that option. However, both companies have seen fit to develop their own chips on the side.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy recently said:\n\"We've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. And the second versions of those chips, with Trainium coming later this year, are very compelling on price performance. We are seeing significant demand for these chips.\"\nHere's the bottom line: Some companies will gladly pay a premium for Nvidia GPUs, but demand for AWS's custom silicon shows that other companies will gladly use slower chips to save money. In other words, AWS (like Apple) is warning investors that Nvidia will almost certainly lose market share in the future, which could pressure the company's margins as it fights to compete with cheaper alternatives.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Johnny Rice, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock sent investors on a wild ride so far in 2024. It was trading at a stock split-adjusted price of around $48 at the start of the year. The price got as high as $140.76 at one point in mid-June, then plunged to $99 by early August before recovering enough to trade around $130 a share by mid-August. It then fell 21% over a few weeks to trade around $103 in early September before recovering somewhat this past week, and it now trades around $118.\nWhew. A wild ride indeed.\nIt's somewhat understandable, of course. As the focal point of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, Nvidia carries a lot on its shoulders, and expectations are sky-high for this tech stock. Even after beating consensus estimates in its last earnings report, the stock price still slipped. Apparently, Wall Street felt it didn't beat their estimates by enough. While the stock's price trajectory is currently on the upswing, investors are hyper-tuned to its performance and any indication of where it may be headed.\nIt might interest investors, then, that Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has been selling some of his Nvidia holdings. In the last month alone, Huang sold 720,000 shares totaling about $78 million.\nThis latest sale isn't his first cashing in on shares. Since just the start of July, Huang has sold over 4 million shares worth roughly $500 million. At first glance, this might be seen as a sign that the person who knows the business the most intimately thinks the stock price is going to drop (or that there's trouble ahead). But a more thorough analysis shows it's not. Although I can't know Huang's exact thinking, there's no reason to take these sales as a cause for worry.\nThe simpler explanation comes down to the cost of living. The vast majority of Huang's net worth is tied up in Nvidia stock. Unfortunately, you can't buy a hamburger (or a super yacht) with stock -- at least not easily. Cash is king, as they say. It is far more likely that Huang is simply liquifying a tiny portion of his massive net worth -- valued at around $100 billion today -- to have some cash on hand.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rules around executives buying and selling their own company's stock. To avoid any suspicion of insider trading (as well as tamp down potential transaction-related public panic), SEC rule 10b5-1 allows executives to release public plans that outline predetermined, automated stock transactions handled by a neutral entity. While it may look like Huang just sold this stock, he actually decided to do so months ago and did it in a way that suggests he had very little influence on the price.\nTracking insider trading can be interesting, but most of the time it means a lot less than it might first seem to.\nAs far as Nvidia's future stock performance, the path ahead has gotten far more complicated, but I still think it's in a strong position. The company's latest quarterly earnings report showed continued growth -- it more than doubled its revenue year over year. The thing investors have to remember is that the major inflection point for Nvidia was the second quarter of last year, so it's natural that the year-over-year growth has cooled a bit from the 200%-plus growth we saw in the last three quarters. Just look at the revenue explode in 2023 in this chart below.\nWhile there was some concern that Nvidia could keep the growth going, many of the fears people had didn't materialize. Concern over a delay in Nvidia shipping its latest generation of superchips was overblown, and demand for its current generation remains extremely strong. Rising concerns around a lack of real-world value for AI potentially hurting Nvidia's clients and reducing their spending has also not yet happened. Companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet are still locked in an AI arms race, and most are expecting to increase their spending, not reduce it.\nMore customers may be around the corner, too. Though Nvidia's data center revenue is highly concentrated in big tech, we could soon see a broader set of commercial clients and even governments begin to invest in earnest. This would be a boon for Nvidia. Government-related contracts can be an extremely lucrative source of revenue and one that is slow to change once the relationship is formalized, providing an additional level of stability.\nFinally, the company's push into the automotive industry is only just ramping up. In the short term, AI-powered infotainment and safety features will drive revenue, but further on the horizon lies the real prize: Self-driving cars.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is moving higher in Wednesday's trading despite volatility. The company's share price was up roughly 1% as of 2:15 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Earlier in the day's session, it had been up as much as 4.9% and down as much as 3.6%.\nNvidia's stock gains today come on the heels of yesterday's big sell-offs triggered by macroeconomic fears. While rebound momentum could be a significant factor in the valuation increase, news that one of the company's rivals is failing to match its processing performance is also helping to push the stock higher.\nNvidia stock got rocked yesterday as investors weighed underwhelming U.S. manufacturing data and concerns the Labor Department will release disappointing jobs numbers on Friday. While it now seems clear that the Federal Reserve will deliver a substantial interest rate cut at its meeting this month, investors are no longer confident it will provide enough of a bullish catalyst to send the market higher. Instead, concerns that the U.S. economy is heading for recession took center stage yesterday.\nNvidia stock fell 9.5% on Tuesday, shaving roughly $279 billion off its market capitalization. While many companies have seen much larger single-day declines on a percentage basis, the sell-off marked the largest pure-dollar valuation decline in market history.\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) leader's stock actually opened lower today due to news that the company had received notice that the Department of Justice was ramping up an investigation into whether its dominance in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market constituted a violation of antitrust laws. But news that its technologies continue to significantly outperform rival offerings helped power a recovery.\nThe Financial Times published a report today stating that Huawei customers were facing challenges after moving away from Nvidia's hardware and software. According to the report, the Chinese tech giant is facing complaints about the performance of its chips and related software platforms.\nThe U.S. has established export restrictions that prevent Nvidia's most advanced processors from being exported to China. As a result, China's government and companies operating within the country have been looking for workarounds -- and chips designed by Huawei have emerged as a prominent alternative. But it looks like Huawei's chips are still significantly behind Nvidia's reliability and processing power when it comes to use cases for advanced AI applications.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "When the word \"semiconductor\" is mentioned, it's nearly impossible not to think of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- and for good reason. Over the last five years, the company has grown its revenue and free cash flow by nearly 900% and 800%, respectively. With that level of growth, it's no wonder industry analysts estimate that Nvidia holds at least 80% market share in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip realm.\nBy all accounts, Nvidia looks unstoppable. However, what goes up must eventually come down, right?\nWhile analyzing Nvidia's second-quarter earnings report, I stumbled across a metric that required a second look because I couldn't believe what I saw. Specifically, I'm beginning to realize that Nvidia's customer concentration trends might suggest the company's growth could come to a screeching halt -- and I think many investors could be caught off guard.\nLet's take a look at Nvidia's customer concentration profile and explore why this is important to understand.\nCustomer concentration measures a business's revenue across its client roster. It helps answer questions seeking to hone in on how much sales are related to a specific customer or group of customers. For example, let's say you have a business with 10 customers, and they collectively generate $1 million in annual sales. However, one customer is responsible for $500K. As an investor, would you be comfortable buying a business that relies on just one client for 50% of its annual revenue? Probably not.\nIn late August, Nvidia reported earnings for its second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Per the company's 10Q filing, 46% of total revenue came from just four customers. That's right -- almost half of Nvidia's $30 billion in quarterly revenue came from only four customers. Although quarterly business trends can fluctuate dramatically, a look at Nvidia's historical customer concentration metrics could suggest the company's growth is increasingly hinging on a particularly small cohort.\nDuring Nvidia's first quarter (ended April 28), the company noted that 24% of total revenue was attributed to two direct customers and that two indirect customers each accounted for at least 10% of revenue. One of these indirect customers actually purchased their products through one of Nvidia's largest direct clients.\nIn its annual report for fiscal year 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia disclosed that 13% of total revenue for the year hailed from one customer (noted as Customer A). The company further informed investors that \"one indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue.\"\nTo put all this into perspective, Nvidia disclosed that no customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal years 2023 or 2022. Clearly, over just the last year or so, Nvidia has experienced soaring demand for its chips -- but much of this growth seems to consistently come from a limited number of customers.\nIt's one thing to be concerned about rising customer concentration trends. However, looking at who this growth may be coming from brings an additional layer of alarm when assessing Nvidia's growth prospects. While I cannot say for certain which companies are specifically in Nvidia's top four, there are some good reasons to believe that much of the company's growth can be traced back to the \"Magnificent Seven\" members.\nOver the last year, executives such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have cited that Meta and Tesla are aggressively buying Nvidia's highly popular H100 graphic processing unit (GPU). This is great news at face value. Being the AI chip of choice for two of the world's largest technology enterprises is more than just a nod of approval. However, investors shouldn't be jumping for joy.\nDuring Tesla's second-quarter earnings call earlier in the summer, Musk gave some heavy signals that the company may seek to compete with Nvidia down the road. Moreover, Meta has been increasing its investments in capital expenditures (capex) -- and not all of that is good news for Nvidia. Meta has developed its own chip, dubbed Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), in an effort to move away from such a heavy dependence on Nvidia. On top of this, e-commerce and cloud computing juggernaut Amazon has also doubled down on its own AI roadmap -- part of which includes developing its own training and inferencing chips.\nTo be clear, I don't see the rising competition as an Achilles' heel for Nvidia. Even if big tech begins to scale down their orders from Nvidia, I surmise the company will have little trouble finding new business. The real concern is that I think Nvidia will lose pricing power as more players enter the chip realm. So, even though Nvidia will likely still generate solid growth, I think the days of triple-digit revenue and profit acceleration could be nearing a close.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks.\nExciting new developments in the artificial intelligence space have continued to pour in over the past few days as the stock market recovers from a major tech selloff. Some of the most trending ones relate to electronics giant Apple, Microsoft-backed AI startup OpenAI, and software firm Adobe. Apple has doubled down on AI with the release of macOS Sequoia, which integrates AI features designed to enhance device performance and user experience. These AI enhancements include real-time content generation and AI-driven privacy tools. With iPhone sales slowing, Apple is banking on AI to reinvigorate interest in its devices, setting itself apart in an increasingly competitive tech market\u200b.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nOn September 13, OpenAI released the highly anticipated Strawberry model, which aims to tackle complex challenges in AI development, including more nuanced decision-making and language processing. This model is expected to advance the capabilities of OpenAI in both consumer-facing tools and enterprise applications. Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos. This positions Adobe at the forefront of generative AI for content creation, with a focus on commercial safety by using licensed datasets.\nLooking ahead, Wall Street analysts project significant revenue and earnings growth for key players in the AI space, particularly in semiconductor companies that power AI applications. NVIDIA, for example, is forecast to achieve an impressive 27% annual revenue growth, outperforming both the semiconductor industry and the broader US market. The total revenue for the chipmaker in 2025 is expected to reach around $123 billion, with earnings projected to grow by over 24%\u200b. The upcoming Blackwell GPU architecture, which offers a 3.7x performance improvement over a predecessor, is seen as a critical driver of AI growth for NVIDIA in the next few months.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

The company is a leader in the AI hardware space, controlling nearly 90% of the market for AI GPUs. However, the AI software capabilities of the firm often go under the radar. NVIDIA has a distinct advantage over competitors like Intel and AMD when it comes to AI software offerings. Some examples of this include the CUDA and AI Enterprise software marketed by the chipmaker. The company charges $4,500 per GPU per year for AI software and tech giants that pay for NVIDIA GPUs also pay for these software features in advance. Within the AI software, the firm also markets the DGX Cloud, a cloud service that allows users to train and deploy AI models over the cloud. This service costs a whopping $37,000 per month.\nWall Street analysts have been monitoring NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) closely. Morgan Stanley has an Overweight rating on the shares with a price target of $144. In a recent investor note, analyst Joseph Moore detailed that the advisory expected initial volumes of Blackwell in the October quarter, as the initial product was functional but with somewhat lower yields, and still expected a volume ramp of the next revision of silicon through January - all of which was still within the broad brush strokes of guidance.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the 19 trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Hedge Funds Are Bullish on This Aggressive Growth Stock",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Aggressive Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other aggressive growth stocks.\nIf you're putting money in the stock market, it's more likely than not that growth is the thing that's on your mind. After all, protecting against inflation doesn't require making risky bets in firms that might see share prices drop in the blink of an eye. Financial instruments, such as inflation protected securities, offer investors the comfort of knowing that their savings do not lose value, meaning that passive income or growth remain some of the most popular reasons why people put their faith in stocks.\nWhen it comes to identifying growth stocks, there are several approaches that are followed. These depend on the business model and the fundamentals of the firms being analyzed. For instance, for profitable companies with a positive net income, the price to earnings ratio is used. However, a large portion of high growth stocks aren't profitable as they reinvest their revenue into expanding market share. This leads to high operating costs, and these firms are valued either through the EV/Sales or EV/EBITDA ratios, depending on whether the firm generates a positive operating income or not.\nBoth the P/E and other ratios tell us the premium that the market is placing over a firm's ability to generate money. For instance, one of the major semiconductor companies in the world, which ranks 6th on our list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News, had a P/E ratio of 112x by the end of Q1 2018. This was before the age of AI, and its two peers in the chip industry had 37x for the chip stock that's Wall Street's AI darling and 19x for the struggling American chip giant that's also the only leading edge US based chip manufacturer. Safe to say, the 112x P/E foretold the story of times to come, and since Q1 2018, the stock has gained a whopping 1,386%.\nOf course, this stock's story isn't the only aggressive growth stock story that we have. While its revenue has grown by 254% between 2018 and 2023, one of the best stories of an aggressive growth stock of our age is Elon Musk's electric vehicle company. The firm had a stunning P/E ratio of 1,120x by the close of 2020 at a time when the retail investing frenzy was at a feverish pitch. Its first profitable quarter, i.e. the quarter ending in June 2020 saw its P/E jump to 512x at a time when its larger and traditional rival was trading at 23.89x. Since then, the shares have gained 180%, and their gains have been trimmed due to the turmoil in the EV industry stemming from supply chain constraints, margin eroding fierce competition, and high interest rates. The stock's all time returns sit at 17,569%.\nShifting gears, the electric vehicle company had an EV/Revenue ratio of 23.56x in August 2012. Similar ratios are typically common in the cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS) industry. As opposed to car manufacturers that face high manufacturing and indirect costs, cloud and SaaS firms reap the benefits of a low cost business model as it takes less money to develop software than to operate an industrial plant. This also means that the firms have more cash at their disposal to focus on growth, and the low margins coupled with the high reinvestment have a direct implication on their valuation.\nLooking at the SaaS sector's median EV/Revenue multiples, data shows that they are affected by interest rates. Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of investing in the stock market, and they also decrease the value of future SaaS earnings in today's dollars as investors can earn more money today through interest. This is also evident in the data, as before the pandemic, the median EV/Revenue multiple was 11x. After the pandemic, when the Federal Reserve was forced to lower rates to nearly zero to avoid economic destruction, the SaaS median EV/Revenue multiple shot to 20x in 2021 as investors found little utility in earning money through interest.\nNow, when the rates are at historic highs, the median multiple over the past 18 months has hovered around 7x. The post pandemic economic disruption has also had an effect on SaaS growth, since pre pandemic, the median revenue growth rate for these firms was 30%, and in the low rate era as the demand for technology services boomed, it grew to 33%. However, the high rates after that, which slowed down business spending, have also impacted the revenue growth rate which is around 17% as of Q1.\nBuilding on this, the SaaS and the broader software industry are also dealing with the impacts of AI. Among the use cases of the new technology is programming, with research from the hedge fund Coatue Management sharing some key insights. Its research shows that high rates might not be the only reason for the sector that's historically been thought to have constituted the highest number of aggressive growth stocks. As per Coatue, compared to a peak value of 30%, the median next twelve month revenue growth rate for the SaaS sector right now is just 1%. This appears to be influenced by AI's impact, as not only has AI reduced the cost of writing code (meaning that SaaS customers can use AI to make their own software) but it is also impacting the traditional seat based model of the industry. This model sees SaaS firms charge customers on the basis of the number of people or 'seats' that have access to their software, and the seat model is now being replaced by consumption driven models.\nThis transition is already playing out in the industry, with one software firm sharing during its Q2 2024 earnings call:\n\"Subscription revenue was $278.1 million, a 21% increase over last year. Now, with the transition that we went through to pay-as-you-go consumption pricing, we are engaging in a much larger number of smaller transactions of shorter term. This offers us greater revenue visibility and greater revenue predictability. Our average TCV [TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE] has plummeted as a result from over $16 million in fiscal year \u201919 to $900,000 last quarter. As we work through this pricing transition, we are seeing, as expected, okay, at first a decline and now a return to accelerating revenue growth. Also as expected, we are seeing a reduction in RPO.\"\nSo, as the aggressive growth stock sector appears to be evolving, we decided to see which such stock hedge funds are buying.\nOur Methodology \nTo make our list of the best aggressive growth stocks to buy, we first ranked the 155 stock holdings of a popular ETF that selects stocks based on the belief that their earnings will grow faster than the average. Then, out of this list, those stocks with a 30%+ annual revenue growth rate during the latest quarter were chosen. These stocks were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024 and the top stocks were chosen.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nRevenue Growth: 122.40%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's largest chip designer in terms of market cap, owing nearly all of its fortunes to the indispensable nature of its products to running AI workloads. The firm's Grace Hopper and Blackwell chips are industry leaders, and its competitive dominance coupled with a tight supply due to excessive demand also means that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) enjoys substantive pricing power in the market. Another key strength is the firm's CUDA platform, which enables users to exercise greater control over their products. However, the pricing power might prove to be NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Achilles' Heel, too. If you read our coverage of SNOW, the 5th stock in this list, you'll know that its shares tanked by 14% after the latest earnings call even though it increased guidance and analyst EPS and revenue estimates. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs might have had a role to play in it, as we subtly alluded. Yet, if alternative products to its GPUs don't surface, which is likely given NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s substantial research and development experience, then the stock could do well in the future depending on the state of the AI industry. On the regulatory front, while media reports claim that the DOJ is interested in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) for abusing its market position, the firm has denied receiving any subpoenas. For NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), investor expectations for its 2025 and 2026 revenue are also key for its hypothesis, as well as the need to maintain cost control as was evident after its third quarter results that saw shares drop by 6% after a disappointing beat and weaker margins.\nArtisan Partners mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s year-to-date dollar value increase is $1.8 trillion. That\u2019s equivalent to the 2023 increase in US GDP, which is, of course, representative of the collective economic efforts of about 330 million people. NVIDIA\u2019s market cap is now $3 trillion. So is the GDP of France.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best aggressive growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Is Going to Soar in the Remainder of 2024",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock jumped 150% in the first half of 2024, but it has been in a slump since mid-July as investors digested some potential headwinds.\nThere was a rumored delay with the company's latest artificial intelligence (AI) chips for the data center, which are responsible for the majority of the company's revenue. Analysts have also questioned how long Nvidia's top customers will continue spending billions of dollars on their AI aspirations.\nHowever, those concerns might have been put to rest over the last few weeks. Here's why Nvidia stock could soar to new highs before the end of 2024.\nNvidia's flagship H100 graphics processor (GPU) for the data center set the benchmark for the AI industry last year. GPUs are designed for parallel processing, which means they can handle multiple tasks at once while maintaining a high throughput. They also have built-in memory so they are ideal for processing large volumes of data, which is critical when training AI models and performing AI inference.\nAccording to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, data center operators could spend $1 trillion building GPU infrastructure over the next few years. That presents a substantial opportunity, which is why the company continues to design new chips with more processing power and better energy efficiency to stay ahead of the competition.\nNvidia is now shipping its new H200 GPU, which can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of the H100, while consuming half the amount of electricity. But the company recently unveiled an entirely new GPU architecture called Blackwell, which promises an even greater leap in performance.\nThe new Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system, for example, will perform AI inference at a staggering 30 times the pace of the equivalent H100 system. Each individual GB200 GPU will be priced between $30,000 and $40,000, which is similar to what many customers originally paid for the H100, so it's going to drive an incredible improvement in cost efficiency. As a result, demand is likely to significantly outstrip supply.\nIn fact, Huang says Blackwell GPUs will bring in billions of dollars in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 (which begins in November) as the company ramps up shipments to customers, squashing previous rumors that the new chips could be delayed by months.\nHuang says data center operators can earn $5 in revenue over four years for every $1 they spend on GPUs, by renting the computing power to AI developers. That's why the world's largest cloud providers, like Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle, are clamoring to get their hands on as many chips as possible.\nOther technology companies also want more chips to develop AI for their own purposes. Tesla is aiming to bring a cluster of 50,000 GPUs online by the end of 2024 to further train its AI-based self-driving software. Meta Platforms wants to have a whopping 600,000 H100 equivalents in action by the end of the year to train the next iteration of its Llama large language models (LLMs), which will power new AI features on Facebook and Instagram.\nUnfortunately for them, Nvidia can't keep up with demand. Oracle chairman Larry Ellison said he recently went to dinner with Huang, alongside Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He and Musk apparently begged Huang to take more of their money for additional GPUs.\nIt's no surprise supply is tight. Microsoft alone spent over $55 billion on capital expenditures (capex) in fiscal 2024 (ended June 30), most of which went toward AI data center infrastructure and chips. Similarly, Amazon says its capex spending will top $60 billion in calendar 2024.\nThat's how Nvidia was able to generate a record $26.3 billion in data center revenue during its recent fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28) alone, which was up 154% from the year-ago period. The result could have been even stronger if not for supply constraints.\nNvidia stock is currently trading 15% below its record high, but I think it will recover that ground (and then some) in the coming months.\nBased on the company's trailing-12-month earnings per share of $2.20, its stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 52.5. That's considerably more expensive than the tech sector as a whole, as represented by the 30.8 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100.\nHowever, the stock market is a forward-looking machine and Nvidia's fiscal 2026 begins at the end of January 2025, which is only a few months away. I think investors will soon start pricing the stock based on its potential earnings in the new year.\nWall Street expects Nvidia to deliver $4.02 in earnings per share during fiscal 2026, which places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 28.7. From that perspective, it actually looks quite cheap!\nMicrosoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms are just some of the companies that have explicitly said they will increase their capex spending on AI in the coming year. Since they are among Nvidia's biggest customers, it reduces some of the uncertainty surrounding Nvidia's potential financial results next year. Therefore, I predict Nvidia stock will surpass its record closing high of $135.58 by the end of 2024.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Meta Platforms wants to have a whopping 600,000 H100 equivalents in action by the end of the year to train the next iteration of its Llama large language models (LLMs), which will power new AI features on Facebook and Instagram.\nUnfortunately for them, Nvidia can't keep up with demand. Oracle chairman Larry Ellison said he recently went to dinner with Huang, alongside Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He and Musk apparently begged Huang to take more of their money for additional GPUs.\nIt's no surprise supply is tight. Microsoft alone spent over $55 billion on capital expenditures (capex) in fiscal 2024 (ended June 30), most of which went toward AI data center infrastructure and chips. Similarly, Amazon says its capex spending will top $60 billion in calendar 2024.\nThat's how Nvidia was able to generate a record $26.3 billion in data center revenue during its recent fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28) alone, which was up 154% from the year-ago period. The result could have been even stronger if not for supply constraints.\nNvidia stock is currently trading 15% below its record high, but I think it will recover that ground (and then some) in the coming months.\nBased on the company's trailing-12-month earnings per share of $2.20, its stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 52.5. That's considerably more expensive than the tech sector as a whole, as represented by the 30.8 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100.\nHowever, the stock market is a forward-looking machine and Nvidia's fiscal 2026 begins at the end of January 2025, which is only a few months away. I think investors will soon start pricing the stock based on its potential earnings in the new year.\nWall Street expects Nvidia to deliver $4.02 in earnings per share during fiscal 2026, which places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 28.7. From that perspective, it actually looks quite cheap!\nMicrosoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms are just some of the companies that have explicitly said they will increase their capex spending on AI in the coming year. Since they are among Nvidia's biggest customers, it reduces some of the uncertainty surrounding Nvidia's potential financial results next year. Therefore, I predict Nvidia stock will surpass its record closing high of $135.58 by the end of 2024.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 12, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.\nWall Street darling NVIDIA Corp. saw its market capitalization climb to $2.61 trillion from $358 billion two years ago with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). However, NVIDIA stock\u2019s unparalleled surge this year hit a speed bump lately due to the violation of antitrust laws, and AI bubble qualms.\nMeanwhile, CEO Jensen Huang has sold NVIDIA\u2019s shares, which makes us wonder whether the chipmaker has the potential to increase shareholder wealth. Let\u2019s have a look \u2013\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filings revealed last week that Huang off-loaded more than $633 million of the chipmaker\u2019s stock since June. Huang has sold shares in tranches of 120,000 each from June 13 to Sept. 5, which accounts for almost 5.3 million shares.\nOn Friday, NVIDIA\u2019s shares posted their worst two-week stretch in two years, while the world\u2019s most sought-after AI player was subjected to wild price swings over the past month that dwarfed even the most volatile assets like cryptocurrency.\nGeopolitical tensions to legal issues plagued NVIDIA, with the stock witnessing a $279 billion wipeout in a single trading session last week. The U.S. Department of Justice subpoenaed NVIDIA in a mounting antitrust issue.\nDoes this sound depressing? Fear not; the NVIDIA stock has an upside potential, and remaining bullish would reap benefits in the long run. Here are the positive reasons \u2013\nInvestors are waiting for the rollout of the cutting-edge new Blackwell chips. However, engineering snags have delayed the process. NVIDIA has been addressing the design flaws in the Blackwell B200 chip and aims to launch it by the year-end. So, the delay period is not long enough to impact the NVIDIA stock\u2019s 2025 results.\nMicrosoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms, Inc. have already ordered Blackwell chips worth billions of dollars, and Amazon.com, Inc. is expected to move from Hopper to Blackwell.\nNVIDIA confirmed that the demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply and may continue into the next fiscal year. After all, the Blackwell platform has more AI throughput than the current Hopper platform. The new Blackwell graphic processing unit (GPU) has greater processing power, which is the most pressing need. It holds 208 billion transistors, way more than the 80 billion in the present H100 CHIP. Also, Blackwell\u2019s NVLink offers high-speed communication, which is the need of the hour.\nThus, strong demand for the Blackwell chip is expected to boost the NVIDIA stock following its launch. Lest we forget, NVIDIA\u2019s shares surged by double digits in the three months following the launch of two previous architectures \u2014 Hopper in the fall of 2022 and Ampere in the spring of 2020.\nIn the dot-com bubble, companies\u2019 shares scaled upward based on hype before the real impact of their business models could be felt. However, AI has become an integral part of all businesses. According to Markets and Markets, the AI industry is poised to expand from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion in 2030.\nNVIDIA is well-poised to make the most of the flourishing AI industry since its chips are essential for AI models deployed across several verticals, including cloud computing. This explains why the company\u2019s H100 graphic cards have huge demand in the AI chip market. Moreover, unlike the stocks in the Internet bubble, NVIDIA has solid fundamentals that validate the company\u2019s stretched valuations, and squash bubble fears.\nNVIDIA has generated profits competently since its return on equity (ROE) is almost 120%, which is way higher than the Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s 73.2%. Notably, any ROE above 100% shows that the company\u2019s net income is more than its equity, or the performance is strong.\nNVIDIA\u2019s net profit margin is 55%, above the industry\u2019s 47.6%. Any net margin of 20% indicates the company can curtail costs and generate profits.\nWhat\u2019s more, NVIDIA recently approved a stock buyback worth $50 billion, indicating a healthy corporate organization. Share repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares and increase the value of the remaining shares, which bodes well for shareholders.\nBeing the worldwide leader in GPUs, NVIDIA\u2019s stock will benefit. Huge data is expected to migrate from central processing units to GPUs, per Huang. According to Precedence Research, the GPU market will expand from $56.55 billion in 2023 to $1,414.39 billion by 2034.\nNVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with Siemens to enter the metaverse space and the introduction of GeForce in the growing gaming market will act as a tailwind for the company. As a result, the $2.80 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s earnings per share is up 76.1% yearly.\nBanking on the highly anticipated launch of the groundbreaking Blackwell chips, inherent capability to crush bubble concerns, the introduction of stock buyback plans, and a dominant player in the semiconductor space gives NVIDIA\u2019s shares the fuel to scale northward despite the current hiccups.\nProminent brokers, thus, have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 40.2% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $106.47. The analysts\u2019 highest price target is $200, indicating an upside of 87.9%.\nMoreover, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average year to date, a tell-tale long-term uptrend. This is why investors should hang on to this multi-bagger stock and not let it go.\nNVIDIA stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Oracle Founder Larry Ellison Just Delivered Fantastic News for Nvidia Stock Investors",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Larry Ellison owns 42% of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), a $465 billion technology giant that is building some of the most powerful data centers for artificial intelligence (AI) development.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) supplies Oracle and most other tech companies with data center chips called graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia has experienced an eye-popping surge in its revenue over the past year, and GPU demand continues to outstrip supply. However, some investors have begun to question how much longer Oracle and its peers can throw billions of dollars at the chip giant to fuel their AI aspirations.\nWorries that the AI train may be starting to lose steam are a key reason Nvidia stock is trading down 14.5% from its all-time high. But the market may have missed comments this month from Ellison at Oracle's financial analyst meeting that suggest more fantastic news for Nvidia's investors.\nOracle's data centers are unique because they are automated. Each one is operationally identical regardless of its size, and since they don't require human workers, it allows the company to build them quickly. Plus, Oracle's RDMA (random direct memory access) GPU networking technology allows data to flow from one point to another more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks.\nSince most AI developers pay for computing capacity by the minute, Oracle's data centers can deliver considerable cost savings compared to competing infrastructure. That's why demand is soaring from leading AI start-ups like OpenAI, Cohere, and xAI. Oracle had 85 data centers up and running with 77 more under construction as of its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended Aug. 31), but Ellison thinks it could operate as many as 2,000 in the long term.\nNext year, Oracle intends to offer a cluster of 131,072 GPUs, which is a big step up from its largest clusters now, at around 32,000 GPUs. But there's another difference: The new cluster will use Nvidia's latest Blackwell chips, which can perform AI inference at 30 times the pace of its flagship H100, which Oracle currently uses. Theoretically, it's going to allow developers to build the largest AI models in history.\nThat's going to benefit Nvidia significantly. It generated $26.3 billion in data center revenue during its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28) primarily from GPU sales, which was a 154% increase from the year-ago period. That growth rate slowed compared to previous quarters because the numbers have become so large, but Nvidia's customers are showing no signs of pulling back.\nIn fact, Oracle spent $6.9 billion on data center infrastructure in fiscal 2024, and it plans to double that figure in fiscal 2025. But it gets better.\nDuring the analyst meeting, Ellison told the audience about a dinner he arranged with Tesla CEO (and xAI founder) Elon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at Nobu in Palo Alto. He recalled himself and Musk begging Huang for more GPUs:\nPlease take our money ... take more of it. You're not taking enough. ... We need you to take more of our money. Please.\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) generated $2.2 billion in revenue during Q1 (primarily from renting data center capacity to customers), which was a 46% increase from the year-ago period. However, Oracle ended the quarter with a record $99 billion in remaining performance obligations (RPOs), a whopping 53% jump. The company said it signed 42 new deals for GPU capacity worth $3 billion during Q1, which contributed to the backlog.\nOracle can't serve all of those AI developers -- or convert its RPO into revenue -- until it brings more data centers online, hence Ellison begging Huang for more GPUs.\nTesla is in a similar position. It's battling for supremacy in the autonomous self-driving software industry, and it's trying to bring a cluster of 50,000 GPUs online by the end of this year to further train its AI models. Tesla will spend $10 billion on that infrastructure, but it's going to need more capacity over time.\nOracle and Tesla aren't the only companies spending big on data centers. Microsoft spent $55.7 billion on capital expenditures (capex) mostly relating to AI infrastructure during its fiscal 2024 year (ended June 30), and it plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025. Similarly, Amazon's capex spending is on track to top $60 billion this calendar year.\nBased on Nvidia's trailing-12-month earnings per share of $2.20, its stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 52.7. That's expensive compared to the 30.9 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 technology index, which hosts many of Nvidia's big-tech peers.\nHowever, Nvidia's fiscal 2026 will begin at the end of January 2025, and Wall Street expects the company to deliver $4.02 in earnings per share for the year. That places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 28.8. In other words, investors who are willing to hold Nvidia stock for at least the next year and a half could be scooping up a bargain at its current price -- assuming Wall Street's forecast proves accurate.\nA slowdown in Nvidia's business will eventually come because the sheer magnitude of current AI spending will be very difficult to maintain over the long term. Plus, competition is slowly coming online in the GPU space, which could erode some of the company's market share in the next few years.\nHowever, based on the facts at hand today, Nvidia stock is likely a good buy at the current price. The earmarked AI spending from some of its largest customers suggests a slowdown isn't on the immediate horizon.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "NVIDIA Wipes Out $400B in Value: Buy, Hold, or Sell NVDA Stock?",
        "Author": "  Tirthankar Chakraborty ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA witnessed a meteoric rise over the past few years due to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Its recent share repurchase has installed confidence among investors and the highly anticipated launch of the new Blackwell architecture should fuel its stock price.\nHowever, American regulators launched a probe into the tech giant\u2019s contracts, which raised a lot of apprehensions about the NVIDIA stock\u2019s future trajectory. NVIDIA\u2019s shares were subjected to huge selloffs lately on Wall Street. So, is this the right time to sell the NVIDIA stock, or will remaining bullish be helpful? Let\u2019s have a look \u2013\n\u00a0\nNVIDIA saw around $406 billion being wiped out from its market value last week, which weighed heavily on Wall Street. The largest chipmaker witnessed wild swings in its share prices over the past 30 days that made even the most volatile asset, Bitcoin (BTC) look calm.\nNVIDIA\u2019s 30-day realized volatility touched a two-year high, dwarfing the level of gyration among Magnificent 7 peers and meme stocks. The NVIDIA stock recorded its worst two-week stretch in two years on Friday after the U.S. Department of Justice summoned the chipmaker in an escalating antitrust issue.\nSeptember, anyhow, isn\u2019t a good month for NVIDIA. According to the Dow Jones Market Data, the chipmaker\u2019s shares, on average, declined 2.4% in September, more than the broader S&P 500\u2019s decline of 1.2%. However, the long run bodes well for the NVIDIA stock that has rewarded investors handsomely this year, with its shares up more than 100% so far.\nNVIDIA recently approved a new $50 billion share repurchase. This indicated that the management is hopeful about the company\u2019s future business endeavors.\nStock buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares and jack up the value of the remaining shares, a blessing for shareholders. After all, decreasing the number of outstanding shares leads to an increase in share prices.\nAnyhow, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average (DMA) so far this year, signifying a long-term uptrend (read more: NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA is all set to launch its cutting-edge Blackwell AI chip later this year, and that can be a game changer. This is because Blackwell is more than just a graphic processing unit (GPU). Its platform will provide more AI throughput than the present Hopper platform.\nThe new Blackwell GPU will offer high-speed communication and greater processing power, which are needs of the hour. And if history repeats itself, the Blackwell launch would lead to an uptick in NVIDIA\u2019s share prices. After all, NVIDIA\u2019s shares did soar by double-digits in the three months following the launch of the previous two platforms \u2013 Hopper and Ampere.\nCEO, Jensen Huang recently said that a huge chunk of data would migrate from central processing units (CPUs) to GPUs, a blessing for NVIDIA. This is because NVIDIA is the worldwide leader in GPUs. The GPU market size is expected to grow to $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $56.55 billion in 2023, per Precedence Research.\nGPU Market Size 2023 to 2034 (USD Billion)\nImage Source: Precedence Research\nNVIDIA\u2019s move to enter the ever-growing gaming space with product line, GeForce, and industrial metaverse in collaboration with Siemens will act as a tailwind for the company. Hence, NVIDIA\u2019s earnings outlook for the current year looks promising, with the $2.80 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s earnings per share up 76.1% year over year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGiven the positives, the NVIDIA stock is destined to scale upward despite facing bouts of volatility in recent times. Notable brokers have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 39.2% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $107.21.

        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA witnessed a meteoric rise over the past few years due to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Its recent share repurchase has installed confidence among investors and the highly anticipated launch of the new Blackwell architecture should fuel its stock price.\nHowever, American regulators launched a probe into the tech giant\u2019s contracts, which raised a lot of apprehensions about the NVIDIA stock\u2019s future trajectory. NVIDIA\u2019s shares were subjected to huge selloffs lately on Wall Street. So, is this the right time to sell the NVIDIA stock, or will remaining bullish be helpful? Let\u2019s have a look \u2013\n\u00a0\nNVIDIA saw around $406 billion being wiped out from its market value last week, which weighed heavily on Wall Street. The largest chipmaker witnessed wild swings in its share prices over the past 30 days that made even the most volatile asset, Bitcoin (BTC) look calm.\nNVIDIA\u2019s 30-day realized volatility touched a two-year high, dwarfing the level of gyration among Magnificent 7 peers and meme stocks. The NVIDIA stock recorded its worst two-week stretch in two years on Friday after the U.S. Department of Justice summoned the chipmaker in an escalating antitrust issue.\nSeptember, anyhow, isn\u2019t a good month for NVIDIA. According to the Dow Jones Market Data, the chipmaker\u2019s shares, on average, declined 2.4% in September, more than the broader S&P 500\u2019s decline of 1.2%. However, the long run bodes well for the NVIDIA stock that has rewarded investors handsomely this year, with its shares up more than 100% so far.\nNVIDIA recently approved a new $50 billion share repurchase. This indicated that the management is hopeful about the company\u2019s future business endeavors.\nStock buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares and jack up the value of the remaining shares, a blessing for shareholders. After all, decreasing the number of outstanding shares leads to an increase in share prices.\nAnyhow, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average (DMA) so far this year, signifying a long-term uptrend (read more: NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA is all set to launch its cutting-edge Blackwell AI chip later this year, and that can be a game changer. This is because Blackwell is more than just a graphic processing unit (GPU). Its platform will provide more AI throughput than the present Hopper platform.\nThe new Blackwell GPU will offer high-speed communication and greater processing power, which are needs of the hour. And if history repeats itself, the Blackwell launch would lead to an uptick in NVIDIA\u2019s share prices. After all, NVIDIA\u2019s shares did soar by double-digits in the three months following the launch of the previous two platforms \u2013 Hopper and Ampere.\nCEO, Jensen Huang recently said that a huge chunk of data would migrate from central processing units (CPUs) to GPUs, a blessing for NVIDIA. This is because NVIDIA is the worldwide leader in GPUs. The GPU market size is expected to grow to $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $56.55 billion in 2023, per Precedence Research.\nGPU Market Size 2023 to 2034 (USD Billion)\nImage Source: Precedence Research\nNVIDIA\u2019s move to enter the ever-growing gaming space with product line, GeForce, and industrial metaverse in collaboration with Siemens will act as a tailwind for the company. Hence, NVIDIA\u2019s earnings outlook for the current year looks promising, with the $2.80 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s earnings per share up 76.1% year over year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGiven the positives, the NVIDIA stock is destined to scale upward despite facing bouts of volatility in recent times. Notable brokers have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 39.2% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $107.21. The highest price target is set at $200, an upside of 86.6%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, NVIDIA stock at the moment is expensive compared to its arch-rivals.

        "Title": "NVIDIA Stock Post 3-Month Split: Buy, Hold, or Sell?",
        "Author": "  Tirthankar Chakraborty ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA was the top performer on the S&P 500 in 2023 and continued its upward movement this year due to its sheer dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\nHowever, NVIDIA stock breezed past $1,000 in early 2024, making it inaccessible for many investors. So, a stock split was initiated in early June. Let\u2019s examine NVIDIA\u2019s performance following the split to determine its present investment potential.\nIn May, NVIDIA declared its intention to split its stock in a 10-for-1 ratio. Immediately after the announcement, the stock climbed from around $900 to more than $1,000. Between the announcement and the split date (Friday, June 7), NVIDIA stock soared about 30%. Post-split, it opened on June 10 at about $120, now trading at around $123, marking a more than 2% increase.\nNVIDIA stock, historically, has gained two out of three times in the three months following a stock split. A Statista report using Bank of America Corporation\u2019s BAC data found that companies that split their stocks had an average return of more than 25% in the 12 months post-split, double the S&P 500\u2019s average return in the same period.\nAfter the split, NVIDIA stock got a boost from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cuts. The Fed trimmed interest rates by 50 basis points to support economic growth. The Fed eased its monetary policy for the first time in four years.\nLower interest rates are expected to reduce NVIDIA\u2019s borrowing costs and boost profit margins. Lower interest rates also don\u2019t affect NVIDIA\u2019s cash flows necessary for growth initiatives.\nGoing back to the 1990s, the NVIDIA stock gained, on average, 20.7% in the 12 months following an interest rate cut, while the S&P 500 jumped only 2.9%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\nDominance in the graphic processing unit (GPU) market, shipment of the most sought-after Blackwell chips by year-end and significant growth in the AI market also boosted NVIDIA stock.\nThe widespread use of NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA software platform over Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u2019s AMD ROCm software platform has given it the bulk share in the GPU market, which is projected to reach $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion in 2024, according to Precedence Research.\nCEO Jensen Huang, meanwhile, assured that the high-end Blackwell chips will be available soon to cater to high demand. This is because the Blackwell chips have more AI throughput than the current Hopper chips.\nA recent report by Bain Technology showed that the AI hardware and software market is estimated to grow to $990 billion by 2027 from around $185 billion in the current year, crushing any concerns that the big cloud companies are contemplating spending big on AI.\nNVIDIA benefits from the AI boom as a key hardware and technology provider for AI applications. It expects revenues of $10 billion for 2024 from the government\u2019s sovereign AI investments, a significant increase from zero last year, per the Bain Technology report.\nNVIDIA\u2019s ability to generate profits proficiently and manage costs efficiently is likely to drive up its future share price based on its return on equity (ROE) and net profit margin.\nNVIDIA\u2019s ROE is 120%, surpassing the Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s 73.2%. Any reading above 100% indicates the company\u2019s net income is exceeding its equity.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA\u2019s net profit margin is 55%, more than the industry\u2019s 47.6%. Any reading above the 20% threshold indicates a high margin (read more: NVIDIA & 2 Other S&P 500 Stocks Show Strong Earnings Growth).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA\u2019s shares rose post-split due to macro trends and continue to be a Wall Street darling based on strong fundamentals.\nProminent brokers have also increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 23.7% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $120.87, while the highest price target is $200, a massive upside of 65.5%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMoreover, the NVIDIA stock is currently trading above the 50-day moving average (DMA) and the 200-DMA, indicating a near-term bullish trend.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA stakeholders, therefore, should retain their market share due to the strong price upside, making selling unlikely. However, NVIDIA stock\u2019s meteoric rise in the past few years due to the advent of AI has made the stock expensive.\nNew buyers, thus, should wait for an opportune moment to invest in NVIDIA. After all, per the price/earnings, the stock is trading at 43.8X, above the peer group\u2019s 18.2X forward earnings multiple.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor now, NVIDIA stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Text": "Alibaba Group Holding (BABA, 9988.HK)'s cloud computing services unit and semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) are collaborating on an artificial intelligence initiative that will enable Chinese automakers to advance the autonomous driving experience for smart vehicle owners.\nAlibaba Cloud, the digital technology backbone of the e-commerce giant, on Friday announced that collaboration, as it unveiled a large multimodal model (LMM) solution for automotive applications that it co-developed with Nvidia and start-up Banma Network Technology, Alibaba's intelligent cockpit solution provider, at the Apsara Conference that ran until Saturday. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\nHangzhou-based Alibaba Cloud's Qwen portfolio of proprietary large language models (LLMs) - including Qwen2-7B and Qwen2-VL - have been integrated with Nvidia's Drive AGX Orin platform for autonomous vehicles. LLMs are the technology underpinning generative AI services like ChatGPT.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nThis marks the first integration of Alibaba Cloud's large AI models into Nvidia's Drive automotive platform, which major Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers - including Li Auto, Great Wall Motors, Geely Auto's Zeekr Intelligent Technology and the EV unit of Xiaomi - are using to power their next-generation fleets.\nNvidia's model acceleration technology has already significantly reduced computational costs and minimised latency in the real-time processing of complex tasks by Alibaba Cloud's AI models. This ensures a smooth and uninterrupted intelligent experience for both drivers and passengers, according to Alibaba Cloud.\n\"Together with our partners, we want to empower more businesses and individuals to unlock the potential of generative AI,\" Alibaba Cloud chief technology officer Zhou Jingren said at the event.\nWith Qwen's advanced capabilities in handling complex inquiries and processing visual intelligence, the new LMM solution will enable in-car voice assistants to engage in dynamic, multi-turn conversations, according to Alibaba Cloud. These assistants will also be able to offer recommendations, ranging from providing information about nearby landmarks to proactively suggesting car headlights be turned on during certain conditions.\nAs part of that LMM solution, Alibaba Cloud's Mobile Agent will enable vehicle owners to effortlessly execute voice commands, such as ordering milkshakes through a food delivery app, resulting in richer in-car experiences, according to Alibaba Cloud.\nWhile stringent US export controls bar Nvidia from selling its most-advanced graphics processing units to mainland Chinese firms, the US company still has a thriving business on the mainland. In its financial year ended January 28, Nvidia said China was its third-largest market.\nNvidia and Alibaba Cloud on Friday announced at Apsara that they plan to work on adapting Qwen LLMs on the US firm's Drive Thor, a next-generation centralised car compute platform that combines advanced driver assistance, autonomous driving and AI cockpit capabilities.\nSanta Clara, California-based Nvidia was also working with Alibaba Cloud in terms of infrastructure \"to meet people's extreme demand for computing power\", Nvidia global vice-president He Tao said at a sub-forum hosted by the US company during the conference.\nNvidia and Alibaba Cloud are pursuing a number of LLM-related initiatives for accelerated computing, which use parallel processing to speed up work and increase energy efficiency across demanding applications, according to Nvidia.\nIn addition, the two companies are working to create customised solutions to help \"traditional enterprises\" move their LLM operations onto the cloud. Cloud computing technology enables enterprises to manage or distribute over the internet a range of software and other digital resources as an on-demand service, just like electricity from a power grid. These resources are stored inside data centres.\nAlibaba Cloud on Friday said its proprietary foundational model Tongyi has attracted more than 300,000 customers via its generative AI platform Model Studio, a significant jump from 90,000 revealed in May.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Text": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nFor the better part of 18 months, the stock market rally has been defined by the rise of artificial intelligence and its impact on a few large tech stocks. \nBut an increasing number of Wall Street strategists don't believe that thesis is what will drive the S&P 500's (^GSPC) next leg higher.\n\"Our sense is that NVDA is becoming just another Large Cap Growth stock,\" Citi's equity strategy team, led by Scott Chronert, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\nNvidia's (NVDA) recent earnings release did little to impress investors. The stock fell about 6% the day after its earnings release. But that sour sentiment didn't permeate through the market as the S&P 500 closed flat on that same day. This marked the second straight quarter that the broader S&P 500 didn't move with Nvidia following its earnings release.\nAnd, as Chronert's team highlights, after a more than 2,000% gain in the past five years, including gaining more than 110% this year alone, Nvidia stock appears to be coming back down to earth.\nWith that cooling off, the current moment may come to mark the end of the first AI-based chapter in this bull market.\n\"A simple look at the deceleration in rate of forward guidance increases suggests that [Nvidia's] most profound performance and fundamental impacts on index price action may be behind,\" Chronert's team wrote.\nAs top holding in the index, what Nvidia does on any given day will remain in focus as it can hold back or bolster the broader market's returns. But recent market action has shown a clear shift in what's driving investors to buy stocks. Instead of wondering how many generative AI chips one company is selling to a few others, developments in the macroeconomy are back to being top of mind for investors, especially the severity of the labor market's cooling.\nTake what's driving the market. Since the start of the quarter on July 1, the S&P 500 is nearly flat. Nvidia, down nearly 15%, and the Magnificent Seven as a whole, off more than 5%, have both lagged the benchmark index.\nMeanwhile, non-tech areas like Utilities, up about 12%, and Financials, up nearly 10%, have been leading the market rally, benefitting from investors positioning for interest rate cuts.\nFor now, it's a macro-driven market and every economic data release seems to matter more than an Nvidia earnings release or a headline about AI chip shipment delays.\nPerhaps the best illustration came last week. The worst weekly performance for both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq for all of 2024 came when the August jobs report failed to provide clarity on the health of the labor market and what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates on Sept. 18.\nOn the one hand, of course Nvidia's health and trajectory are still critical to the current bull market. On the other, big as Nvidia is, it's not more important than the US economy. And, perhaps, that's the way it should be. It is after all \"just another Large Cap Growth stock.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.\u00a0Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nWhile everyone is talking about rate cuts, some analysts are questioning whether it was necessary even to start cutting rates at this time. Latest data released on Tuesday showed retail sales in the US rose while Wall Street analysts were expecting to see a decline. Oksana Aronov, JPMorgan Asset Management head of market strategy for alternative fixed income, said while talking to CNBC that rate cuts are not even warranted as she thinks there are no signs of broader weakening except for the labor market.\nAronov said cutting rates would \u201cloosen\u201d the financial conditions further. The analyst said that about 14 months ago, everyone was looking at the CPI that was clocking in at 3% and expected the metric to fall to 2%. But even after all these months, CPI year over year is at 2.9%. She said that the Fed should move carefully and the 2% inflation target would be \u201celusive\u201d because fiscal spending will continue to rise.\nAI investors are however looking beyond this debate and already positioning to pile into more growth stocks amid the beginning of the rate-cut cycle.\nFor this article, we picked 10 buzzing AI stocks and discussed the latest news around them.\nWith each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPhoto by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nDan Niles, founder and portfolio manager at Niles Investment Management, said in a latest interview with CNBC that despite his belief that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is going through a \u201cdigestion\u201d phase as investors fear a slowdown in spending and want to see a return on their investments, the chipmaker\u2019s shares and revenue could double.\n\u201cI firmly believe in the next several years that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revenues will again be able to double from current levels and the stock will be able to double as well.\u201d\nNiles yet again mentioned the Cisco analogy, saying the company saw several years of revenue growth before hitting its peak.\nNvidia\u2019s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\nAt Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\nOf course, Nvidia won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: Putting $300 to Work in These 3 Unstoppable Stocks Right Now Would Be a Smarter Move",
        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the best aspects of putting your money to work on Wall Street is that most online brokers have eliminated barriers that had previously kept retail investors on the sideline. Minimum deposit requirements and commission fees for common stock trades on major U.S. exchanges are predominantly a thing of the past.\nFor everyday investors, it means virtually any amount of money -- even $300 -- can be the perfect amount to put to work in the stock market.\nWhile it might sound tempting to invest $300 in the hottest stock on Wall Street, artificial intelligence (AI) kingpin Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), there are three unstoppable stocks that make for much smarter buys right now.\nDespite Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) absolutely dominating in high-compute data centers, there are a number of reasons to believe the company's stock has peaked and will underperform in the years to come.\nFor example, there hasn't been a next-big-thing innovation for at least three decades that's avoided an early innings bubble-bursting event. Without fail, investors consistently overestimate the adoption and utility of new technologies and innovations, which eventually leads to real-world results falling short of otherworldly expectations. If artificial intelligence follows this path, no company is going to be hurt more than Nvidia.\nAnother expected headwind for Nvidia is an increase in competition. While it's well-documented that other chipmakers are ramping up production and/or debuting AI-GPUs for AI-accelerated data centers, investors are likely overlooking the prospect of internal competition. All four of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are developing AI-GPUs of their own, which will undoubtedly limit future orders for the company's hardware.\nInsiders aren't giving investors a reason to buy, either. Nvidia's recently unveiled $50 billion buyback program, or as I refer to it, the \"smoke-and-mirrors campaign,\" doesn't hide the fact that it's been 45 months since a single share was purchased by an insider on the open market.\nLastly, Nvidia's valuation isn't nearly as enticing as it might appear. Shares of the company are valued at an unsightly 30 times trailing-12-month (TTM) sales, and briefly topped a TTM price-to-sales ratio of 40 in June.\nForget about Nvidia and consider putting $300 to work right now in the following three unstoppable stocks.\nThe first sensational stock that can be bought with $300 right now, and has all the tools needed to deliver superior returns to Nvidia in the coming years, is leading payment processor Visa (NYSE: V).\nDespite recessionary red flags cropping up, Visa benefits immensely from the non-linearity of the economic cycle. While recessions are both normal and inevitable, they're historically short-lived. Just three of the 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II endured for a full year.\nBy comparison, most periods of growth stick around for many years, if not a decade. Visa enjoys the spoils of lengthy growth periods and the long-term expansion of consumer and enterprise spending.\nAt the same time, Visa is well-protected from downturns thanks to its purposeful avoidance of lending. Although some of its peers act as lenders and payment processors, Visa solely focuses on payment facilitation. Since it doesn't lend, it's not required to set aside capital for those inevitable periods where the U.S. economy weakens. This gives Visa more financial flexibility than its peers and helps it bounce back from recessions very quickly.\nVisa has an incredible opportunity in overseas markets, too. Cross-border payment volume grew 14% on a constant-currency basis in Visa's latest quarter, which follows a consistent theme of sustained double-digit growth in cross-border payment volume. Many of the world's fastest-growing emerging markets are chronically underbanked, which provides Visa with a no-brainer opportunity to sustain double-digit annual earnings growth through the remainder of this decade, if not well beyond.\nA second unstoppable stock that can outpace Nvidia in the return column and makes for a stellar buy right now with $300 is media goliath Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS).\nFew companies were clobbered more directly by the COVID-19 pandemic than Disney. The closing of theme parks, coupled with limited studio output and select movie theater closures, severely hampered its bottom line. But with China's economy reopened and studio output ramping up, Disney is shining, once more.\nPerhaps the best aspect of Disney's operating model is that it can't be duplicated. Even though there are no shortage of movies and shows to watch and theme parks to visit, no other company offers the history, depth of engagement, characters, or storytelling capacity that Disney brings to the table. This alone ensures that Walt Disney will continue to generate predictable cash flow from its multiple operating segments.\nSomething else for investors to be excited about is Disney's progress with its direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment. After years of sizable losses, Disney delivered its first operating profit from its DTC segment. Being an irreplaceable media company has allowed it to increase subscription prices for all of its tiers and move its DTC segment to profitability a full quarter ahead of schedule.\nThe \"House of Mouse\" is also historically inexpensive. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18 marks a 31% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the prior half-decade. Further, Disney should be able to deliver sustained double-digit earnings growth as its DTC segment and studio begin to stretch their proverbial legs.\nThe third unstoppable stock that makes for a smarter buy than Nvidia with $300 right now is small-cap adtech company PubMatic (NASDAQ: PUBM).\nPubMatic finds itself perfectly positioned to take advantage of the rise of digital advertising. Even though advertising is highly cyclical, and businesses aren't shy about paring back their marketing budget at the first sign(s) of trouble, the aforementioned non-linearity of economic cycles works in favor of ad-driven businesses. Investors with a long-term mindset should benefit from owning stakes in companies that see ad spending climb over time.\nOne of the key reasons PubMatic is set for success is the decision by its management team to design and develop its own cloud-based programmatic ad platform. While it would have been easy for PubMatic to rely on a third-party provider, the decision to build its own cloud-based infrastructure should result in a decisively higher operating margin as it scales its revenue.\nAs noted, PubMatic has honed in on the fastest-growing aspects of the advertising arena. Specifically, it's a sell-side platform aiming to sell digital display space for advertisers in mobile, video, and connected TV (CTV). All three of these segments can sustain double-digit annual ad spending growth for the foreseeable future, with CTV ad spend growing the fastest.\nLastly, PubMatic is sitting on a cash-rich balance sheet that gives it ample financial flexibility. The company ended June with $165.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, and no debt, and has repurchased roughly $100 million worth of its common stock. Additionally, it's working on its 10th consecutive year of generating positive operating cash flow.\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Visa wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco ",
        "Text": "From sifting through investor presentations and corporate filings to listening to earnings calls and watching interviews, getting a firm gauge on an investment often requires a lot of work.\nOne thing that I like to do is analyze 13F filings. These are forms filed by investment firms managing over $100 million in stocks. One of the more high-profile hedge funds is Ken Griffin's Citadel. Last quarter, Citadel reduced its stake in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) by 79% \u2014 dumping 9,282,018 shares. In addition, the firm increased its position by 1,140% in Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR), scooping up 5,222,682 shares.\nLet's dig into what may have compelled Griffin and his portfolio managers to sell Nvidia and buy Palantir. Moreover, I'll explore what catalysts could help fuel even more growth for Palantir \u2014 and why now could be a great time to follow Griffin's lead.\nOn the surface, selling Nvidia stock might look like a questionable move. After all, isn't artificial intelligence (AI) the next big thing?\nWell, even if AI ends up being the generational opportunity it's being touted to be, that doesn't mean a whole lot at face value. There are many components to the foundations of AI, and Nvidia's expertise in the development of advanced chipsets called graphics processing units (GPU) is just one of many building blocks supporting artificial intelligence.\nThe biggest bear narrative surrounding Nvidia stems from rising competition. At present, products developed by Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are the most obvious alternatives to Nvidia. However, I see a bigger risk in the competitive landscape.\nNamely, Nvidia's big tech cohorts including Tesla, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Amazon are all investing heavily into their own hardware development. Considering that many of these companies are Nvidia's own customers, I'm wary that the company's current growth trajectory is sustainable in the long run.\nWhen more GPUs come to market, there is a good chance this technology will be viewed as somewhat commoditized. Such a dynamic will likely lead to lower prices for Nvidia, which will subsequently bring decelerating revenue, margins, and profits.\nAll told, I don't really blame Griffin for selling such a large portion of his Nvidia position. Despite the company's success so far, its future prospects look potentially questionable.\nIn a different area of the AI landscape sits enterprise software company Palantir. It offers four data analytics platforms called Foundry, Gotham, Apollo, and AIP. The company's software is used across a host of use cases throughout the U.S. military and private sector.\nInvestors can see that over the last couple of years, Palantir's revenue accelerated on the backdrop of a bullish AI narrative. More importantly, the company's operating leverage has improved dramatically in the form of margin expansion and consistent profitability.\nEarlier this month, Palantir also achieved the notable milestone of inclusion in the S&P 500.\nI can't say for certain why Griffin increased his stake in Palantir so much last quarter, but I do find the timing interesting for one particular reason. Palantir has been eligible for the S&P 500 before but was not initially chosen. Perhaps some thought Palantir's newfound growth was purely an extension of demand for AI software and would not be sustainable in the long run.\nWhatever the case, I think those who have followed Palantir for a long time understood that the company's long-run prospects looked solid \u2014 regardless of the current AI narrative. Bearing that in mind, it was reasonable to think that the company would be included in the S&P 500 eventually.\nThis leads me to a broader point. Now that Palantir is in the S&P 500, there is a good chance more investment banks and research analysts will begin following the company more closely. In turn, this could lead to an increase in institutional investors buying the stock. Over time, this could strengthen Palantir's brand and perception in the investment community and bring the stock to even higher prices.\nI think there is a good chance Palantir will witness a rise in institutional ownership. The company is quickly emerging as a force in the AI software arena, and has even attracted the likes of Microsoft and Oracle \u2014 two relationships that I think will bring even further growth to the company.\nI very much see even better days ahead for Palantir, and think now is a great time to buy shares. With so many catalysts fueling the company's upside, I see Griffin swapping Nvidia for Palantir as a particularly savvy move.\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Has Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) finally run out of earnings surprises?\nThe high-flying AI chip superstar seemed to run out of gas in the fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings report it released on Aug. 28. While the company beat estimates on the top and bottom lines, the differences were narrower than investors were used to, and guidance was also less impressive than some had hoped.\nAdditionally, the company reported its first sequential decline in gross margin since demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) surged following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, a sign the chipmaker's profitability has peaked.\nSince then, Nvidia has continued to pull back, falling Tuesday on a report it was subpoenaed by the Department of Justice as part of an antitrust investigation. The company later said it had not received a subpoena.\nNonetheless, as of its close on Sept. 6, the stock was down 18% from where it was trading before the earnings report came out.\nThat sets up a potential buying opportunity for investors as the stock is now about as cheap as it's been (on a valuation basis) since the AI boom began, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 49.\nFor investors considering buying the dip on Nvidia, the AI stock is well-positioned to recoup its recent losses in the fourth quarter and move higher. Let's take a look at a few reasons why.\nThe launch of Nvidia's new Blackwell platform has been eagerly awaited since the company announced it in March at its GTC conference.\nThe new GPU ecosystem has been delayed about three months due to a design flaw, but it's expected to be ready to go in the fourth quarter. According to Nvidia, Blackwell is able to run generative AI programs and massive large language models at up to 25 times less cost and energy requirements than the earlier Hopper model. That could be a game-changer for the AI industry in the wide range of companies depending on Nvidia GPUs.\nCFO Colette Kress told investors on the recent earnings call, \"Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year.\"\nThe launch of the platform should support the company's growth and margins, and a successful rollout is likely to lift the stock as well.\nInvestors will be closely watching management's guidance when the company reports its fiscal third-quarter earnings in November for signs of Blackwell's impact.\nThe Fed is expected to cut interest rates at its meeting later this month, and rate cuts are likely to fuel gains for Nvidia and much of the stock market. Lower interest rates will encourage more consumer spending and business investment, and they tend to favor growth stocks like Nvidia as well.\nThere has already been evidence of this as Nvidia stock jumped 4.5% on Aug. 23 after Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated the time had come for the central bank to begin to cut rates.\nAssuming rates come down as fast or even faster than expected, Nvidia is likely to benefit.\nMuch of Nvidia's demand comes from cloud infrastructure giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon, and those companies look set to continue ramping up their purchases of Nvidia's components as they build out their AI capacity.\nTop tech CEOs like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla's Elon Musk have stressed the importance of staying ahead in the AI race as the consequences of falling behind could be much greater than overspending on AI hardware.\nAdditionally, Q4 tends to be a strong quarter in the tech industry, particularly in cloud software and infrastructure, and solid demand there should support further spending on Nvidia's products.\nAfter pulling back following its fiscal second-quarter report, Nvidia benefits from lower expectations and a more attractive stock price. If the company executes well on its Blackwell launch, not to mention any boost from the macroeconomic environment, it could be racing back toward its previous highs in the fourth quarter and beyond.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Some data centers can\u2019t be filled to full capacity, and others are being built well away from population centers.\nNvidia\u2019s leader has argued that his company\u2019s products, while more power hungry than their predecessors \u2014 the latest generation chip requires over a kilowatt \u2014 are more efficient because they can do the work of training and running AI software more quickly and replace multiple older components.\nSeparately, Huang said he\u2019s doing his best to serve customers in China and stay within the requirements of US government restrictions on Nvidia\u2019s exports to that country.\n\u201cThe first thing we have to do is comply with whatever policies and regulations that are being imposed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, meanwhile, do the best we can to compete in the markets that we serve. We have a lot of customers there that depend on us and we\u2019ll do our best to support them.\u201d\n--With assistance from Ed Ludlow and Ian King.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAdam Neumann\u2019s Latest Project Is a WeWork Competitor\nThe Great \u20ac3 Billion Shipping Container Heist\nElon Musk\u2019s Role in Reanimating the Far-Right Term \u2018Remigration\u2019\nHow a Short Seller\u2019s Attack Threatens This Spanish Family Company\nSports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Could Hit $200 in 2025",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock's breathtaking rally that began toward the end of 2022 has taken a hiatus of late. More specifically, shares of Nvidia have witnessed some volatility since the beginning of July, and the company's solid fiscal 2025 second-quarter results haven't been enough to inject some life into its fortunes on the stock market.\nThe reasons behind Nvidia's recent volatility can be attributed to concerns about a slowdown in its growth, as well as the viability of artificial intelligence (AI) technology following the massive investments made in this space by companies and governments across the globe. However, Nvidia's quarterly results and bullish guidance make it clear that the company's impressive growth is here to stay.\nMoreover, a closer look at the consensus stock price target indicates analysts expect Nvidia stock to regain its mojo. Nvidia has a median 12-month price target of $150 as per 63 analysts covering the stock, which would be a 28% jump from current levels. However, the Street-high price target of $200 suggests that Nvidia stock could jump another 71% over the next year.\nHere's why this semiconductor company's shares could hit that mark in 2025.\nStrategic advisory firm Constellation Research gave Nvidia stock a $200 price target in June this year. The firm points out that the semiconductor bellwether enjoys several advantages that could send its shares to $200 in the coming year and even help it sustain its rally for a longer period.\nConstellation says Nvidia has managed to create high barriers to entry in the AI chip market and has a robust product roadmap, while high switching costs mean that customers who are locked into its ecosystem are unlikely to move to a competing offering anytime soon. Because of these reasons, the research firm estimates Nvidia enjoys a technology lead of 24 months over its rivals in the AI graphics card market.\nA closer look at Nvidia's recent quarterly results will show that it is indeed the go-to supplier of graphics cards for companies and governments looking to train and deploy AI models. The company's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 shot up an impressive 122% year over year to $30 billion. The data center business produced $26.3 billion in revenue during the quarter, a jump of 154% from the same period last year.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang pointed out that the demand for the company's graphics cards based on the Hopper architecture remains solid, with shipments expected to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. That's a testament to Nvidia's outstanding moat in the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) market as the company's next-generation Blackwell chips are already sampling with customers and are set to go into full production from the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.\nIn other words, customers are still willing to purchase Nvidia's older AI chips even though the new ones are on the way, suggesting that its products are indeed superior to rivals such as AMD and Intel. For instance, Nvidia's Hopper H200 processor reportedly outperforms its AMD rival, MI300X, by more than 40% in AI inference applications. Considering that the H200 reportedly costs less than the MI300X, it is easy to see why Nvidia has been witnessing an improvement in the demand for this chip even though newer chips are on the way.\nNot surprisingly, Nvidia is likely to maintain its dominant position in the AI chip market. That's also helping the company maintain healthy pricing power and enjoy fat margins. For example, Nvidia's non-GAAP gross margin increased by 5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis last quarter to 75.1%.\nAs a result, the company's adjusted earnings jumped 152% year over year to $0.68 per share, prompting analysts to increase their earnings projections for the current and the next fiscal year.\nThe chart above indicates that Nvidia's earnings could hit $4 per share in the next fiscal year (which will coincide with the majority of calendar 2025). However, there is a good chance that its earnings could exceed that mark as analysts could continue to raise their growth expectations because of a potentially big jump in its data center revenue next year.\nLet's assume that Nvidia's earnings really do increase to $4 per share. That would be a 41% increase over its projected fiscal 2025 earnings. If the stock maintains its price-to-earnings ratio of 55 at that time, the stock price could jump to $220. It is worth noting that Nvidia is currently trading at a relative discount to its five-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 72.\nMore importantly, this company can justify its valuation through impressive growth because of its robust position in the AI chip market. So, there is a good chance that this AI stock could resume its journey north and go past $200 next year.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 16, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, Apple Inc\u2019s AAPL and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM.\nOf late, the stock market has wavered, with tech stocks underperforming in July and August. The euphoria about the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution faded following the post-earnings decline in shares of prominent chipmakers, leaving Wall Street without a major driver.\nChip stocks tanked from a mid-July high as their stretched valuations raised doubts about their capability to sustain real revenue growth, which resembles the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nHowever, the AI boom is here to stay and will drive the prices of chip stocks northward. In reality, chip stocks have now begun to gain ground by banking on the strength of AI. Thus, it\u2019s prudent for investors to keep an eye on chip stocks like NVIDIA Corp., Broadcom Inc. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., which display strong price upsides and increase shareholders\u2019 wealth.\nThe foundation of AI is based on practical applications whereas the dot-com companies had business models based on speculative ideas. Moreover, several sectors, including technology, healthcare, transportation, agriculture and finance, are adopting AI, curtailing sector-related bubbles\u2019 risks.\nCompanies from these sectors utilize AI for product innovation, efficiency and cost savings. Thus, AI has more tangible economic benefits in contrast to the abstract nature of the dot-com period. Mature infrastructure like cloud computing platforms supports the deployment of AI technologies. However, these established infrastructures were not there for dot-com ventures.\nThe global AI industry expanded beyond $184 billion in 2024, a jump of nearly $50 billion from 2023. The astounding growth is estimated to continue till 2030, with AI market size surpassing $826 billion, according to Statista.\nNVIDIA will benefit from this growth since the chip giant provides hardware and technologies vital for AI applications. NVIDIA\u2019s graphic processing unit (GPU) is a core part of the computer server infrastructure required to train large language models and function AI interfaces.\nBroadcom also plays a crucial role in the AI ecosystem. Its products used in data centers are important for AI applications. Broadcom\u2019s CEO Hock Tan expects the company\u2019s AI revenues to climb to $12 billion in fiscal 2024 and increase further in fiscal 2025 due to an uptick in demand for custom accelerators for AI data centers. Broadcom\u2019s AI revenues increased 10% sequentially in the fiscal fourth quarter to about $3.5 billion.\nTaiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC, manufactures chips for companies that make AI hardware and are therefore well-poised to gain from the flourishing AI industry. TSMC\u2019s manufacturing capability is required for GPUs to be functioning. These GPUs are essential for data centers where huge amounts of data are stored. These data are needed for AI applications, whose demand has shot up and, in turn, is expected to boost TSMC\u2019s business.\nA possible green light from the U.S. government to export chips to Saudi Arabia, the launch of the much anticipated next-generation Blackwell chip and a wide competitive moat in the GPU market space will surely help the NVIDIA stock to scale northward (read more: 2 Reasons NVIDIA Stock Popped Yesterday With More Room to Run).\nBrokers, thus, have jacked up the average short-term price target of NVDA by 27.7% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $116.91. The highest price target is $200, an upside of 71.1%.\nBroadcom\u2019s capability to pay off debts banking on strong cash flow should propel its stock price. Broadcom\u2019s free cash flow (FCF) was $4.791 billion in the fiscal third quarter, while revenues came in at $13.07 billion. Thus, the FCF margin was 36.65% (i.e., $4.791 billion/$13.07 billion in revenues), slightly more than last quarter\u2019s 36% (read more: Broadcom Selloff Explained! Should You Buy the Dip in AVGO Stock?).\nHence, brokers have increased the average short-term price target of AVGO by 20.3% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $158.27. The highest price target is $240, an upside of 51.6%.\nTSMC\u2019s significant pricing power due to its supremacy in the high-end chip market, and being the exclusive manufacturer of Apple Inc\u2019s\u00a0 AI chips should help its share prices scale upward (read more: 2 AI Stocks That Can Be the Next NVIDIA).\nTherefore, brokers have raised the average short-term price target of TSM by 20.3% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $170.23. The highest price target is $250, an upside of 46.9%.\nShares of NVIDIA, Broadcom, and TSMC have soared 140.6%, 47.4% and 64.8%, respectively, so far this year.\nAll these stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 6, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. TSM.\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nThe advent of artificial intelligence (AI) helped Wall Street's darling semiconductor stock, NVIDIA Corp., witness a meteoric rise in the last few years. NVIDIA designs specialized chips and outsources the manufacturing to foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd., better known as TSMC. So, in a way, these stocks complement each other; they aren't competitors.\nThe TSMC stock has also seen healthy gains so far this year. However, recently, a couple of factors weighed on NVIDIA's shares. Does this mean the TSMC stock is now more alluring compared to the NVIDIA stock? Let's have a look \u2013\nDemand for AI models is here to stay for the long run as they are presently deployed across several verticals, including cloud computing. NVIDIA's chips are needed for AI models, which explains why the semiconductor giants' H100 graphic cards are the most desirable in the AI chip market.\nMoreover, the largely anticipated next-generation Blackwell AI chips would provide NVIDIA a competitive edge over its peers since this chip's infrastructure platform can offer more AI throughput than the present Hopper platform. Simultaneously, NVIDIA's initiatives to penetrate the gaming market with GeForce and the industrial metaverse space in a tie-up with Siemens is a tailwind for the company.\nThe company's CEO, Jensen Huang also acknowledged that $1 trillion worth of data centers would migrate from central processing units to graphic processing units (GPUs). NVIDIA is the global leader in GPUs and its revenues from the data center business soared 154% year over year in the second quarter of 2025.\nNVIDIA also approved a $50 billion share repurchase plan, a tell-tale sign of a healthy corporate organization (read more: NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?)\nDespite the positives, the NVIDIA stock is facing bouts of volatility in September. The NVIDIA stock lately notched its worst two-day trading stretch in about two years after the Department of Justice subpoenaed the chipmaker regarding an antitrust investigation.\nAnyhow, September is historically the worst month for the NVIDIA stock. NVIDIA's shares, on average, declined 2.4% in September compared to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq's decline of 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively, per the Dow Jones Market Data.\nNVIDIA's latest promising quarterly results also failed to jack up its share price as it couldn't keep up with high expectations. After all, the NVIDIA stock has been the best performer on the S&P 500 so far this year (read more: The Best Chip Stock Post NVIDIA Earnings: NVDA, AMD or INTC?).\nUnlike NVIDIA, the TSMC stock has fared much better in September and there are a couple of reasons to be positive on it. As more companies have started to implement AI features in smartphones, the demand for TSMC's chips is expected to increase. Apple Inc (APPL) is one of the primary clients of TSMC and the launch of iPhone 16 would surely boost demand for TSMC's chips.\nThe ever-growing demand for AI applications would help TSMC's sales improve in the upcoming years. Notably, demand for AI applications such as Open AI's ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Gemini have increased substantially in recent times.\nAs a result, TSMC's earnings outlook for the present year looks encouraging, with the $6.45 Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share up 11.4% year over year.\nIn early August, NVIDIA's shares took a beating after major tech players curtailed spending on AI. NVIDIA is heavily dependent on the AI industry and lacks diversification.\nOn the contrary, TSMC's customer base is not limited to the AI industry only. It is spread across the automotive and consumer electronic industries. This diversification insulates the TSMC stock from any industry-specific downturns and provides a steady stream of income.\nThe TSMC stock accounts for an astounding 90% of high-end chips in the global semiconductor market. This dominance gives the TSMC stock significant pricing power. When NVIDIA fails to meet the soaring demand for AI chips, TSMC can leverage its capacity to charge higher prices and increase profitability.\nTSMC, by the way, is the exclusive manufacturer of Apple's AI chips, and this relationship should certainly lead to higher volume orders, boosting TSMC's revenues. However, NVIDIA's total dependency on data center AI chips means that any disruption in the AI industry would impact its business.\nThe TSMC stock is less expensive than NVIDIA, which has given the integrated circuit foundry an upper hand over the semiconductor behemoth. This is because buying TSMC's shares won't burn a larger hole in your wallet than the NVDA stock.\nAfter all, per the price/earnings ratio, the TSMC stock currently trades at 24.8X forward earnings. However, NVDA's forward earnings multiple is 39.1X.\nThe TSMC stock is a better buy than the NVIDIA stock due to reasonable valuations, pricing power, tactical partnerships, diversification, and an inherent ability to exploit the growing demand for AI applications.\nWell-known brokers have increased the average short-term price target of the TSMC stock by 27.6% from the company's last closing price of $160.49. The analysts have set the highest price target at $250, an upside of 55.8%.\nThe TSMC stock, thus, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). But NVDA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Affan Mir ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of the 7 Best Performing Long Term Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other best performing long term stocks in 2024.\nAfter the latest 50 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the market has been performing well. All of the major market indices have been in the green since then and experts are taking it as a good sign.\nWe discussed the Fed\u2019s rate cut in our article about the best day trading stocks. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\u201c\u2026the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) chose to lower its policy interest rate by 50 basis points, a move intended to ease monetary policy. Powell explained that this action reflects growing confidence that labor market strength can be maintained, while inflation continues to decrease toward the Fed\u2019s target. Powell emphasized the Fed\u2019s flexibility in its approach and noted that future rate changes will depend on incoming data and the evolving economic landscape.\nLead writer for Markets Live at The Wall Street Journal, Gunjan Banerji also shares the market\u2019s optimistic sentiment as she explained in an interview with CNBC on September 25. Banerji discussed the growing optimism in the stock market despite ongoing bullish sentiment for the past few years. She highlighted how the recent rate cut by the Federal Reserve boosted market confidence, with the VIX (volatility index) dropping to its lowest levels and other indicators like high-yield bonds and options showing continued belief in the rally.\nDominic Chu of CNBC expressed concerns about potential market overconfidence, given the calmness amid geopolitical risks, the upcoming U.S. presidential election, and consumer spending challenges. Banerji acknowledged these risks but emphasized that much of the market\u2019s optimism is tied to the Fed\u2019s actions, with people reassured by the larger-than-expected rate cut.\nFinally, Banerji pointed out a broadening of the market rally beyond the tech sector and mentioned the strong performances in sectors like energy and materials, and record highs from companies like Caterpillar and McDonald\u2019s, which indicates a healthier, more diverse market rally.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used stock screeners to identify nearly 60 mid to mega-cap stocks with year-to-date share price returns of over 100%. Next, we narrowed our list to 7 stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside, as of September 24. We also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 elite hedge funds. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of their upside potential.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nIs NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) the Best Performing Long Term Stock in 2024?\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 24.10%\nStock Price Performance YTD: 150.92%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a powerhouse in the technology sector, known for its work in graphics processing units and AI. It was originally focused on advancing the gaming experience but has now transformed the landscape of computer graphics with the launch of its GPU in 1999, which significantly improved video game performance and 3D applications.\nOver the years, the company has broadened its product range to include central processing units, data processing units, and various software solutions tailored for high-performance computing and deep learning. Today, it serves a wide range of industries, including gaming, professional visualization, data centers, automotive, and healthcare.\nIt takes its place on our list of the best performing long term stocks in 2024. The stock has a consensus Strong Buy rating from 64 analysts. As of September 24, the average price target of $150.00 represents an upside of 24.10% from the present levels.\nOne of the most eagerly awaited developments is the Blackwell product line. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) forecasts substantial revenue from this new series, which promises to be a game-changer in the field. The order book for both the current Hopper chip lineup and its successor, Blackwell, is strong.\nThe products feature advanced technology that allows clusters of NVIDIA chips to function as cohesive units that process massive amounts of data and execute computations at unprecedented speeds. This is especially valuable for training the neural networks that power modern AI applications.\nDemand for the company\u2019s existing products remains strong, and as supply chains improve, orders for the Blackwell range are steadily increasing. CEO Jensen Huang has emphasized that the company is ramping up production of the Blackwell GPU and is on track to begin shipments in the fourth quarter.\nWhile some engineering challenges have arisen that may delay certain product releases, the overall momentum is positive, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is ready to scale production as it moves into the next year.\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) was held by 179 hedge funds in the second quarter and the stakes amounted to $53.67 billion. Fisher Asset Management is the top shareholder of the company and has a position worth $11.54 billion as of Q2.\nIthaka Group stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d\nOverall, NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the best performing long-term stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today we will analyse the most recent data on NVIDIA\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n View our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nThe stock is currently trading at US$117 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 22% compared to our intrinsic value of $95.42. This means that the opportunity to buy NVIDIA at a good price has disappeared! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since NVIDIA\u2019s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NVDA\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on NVDA for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nIf you want to dive deeper into NVIDIA, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for NVIDIA (of which 1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) you should know about.\nIf you are no longer interested in NVIDIA, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): \u2018It\u2019s A Supply Problem, Not A Demand Problem\u2019",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently published Jim Cramer\u2019s Exclusive List: 10 Stocks to Monitor Closely. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recommends to monitor closely.\nOn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer emphasized the risks of straying too far from technology stocks, particularly the dominant tech companies, in today\u2019s market. He pointed out how JP Morgan, despite being one of the best-performing banks, caused a stir by cutting its forecast, warning that estimates might be overly optimistic. This news hurt the broader market, dropping it by 93 points, although the S&P 500 saw a slight rise of 0.54%, and the tech-driven NASDAQ gained 0.84%.\n\u201cIn this market, every time you stray too far from technology, especially the tech titans, you ultimately get slapped in the face by reality. That\u2019s what happened today when the largest, and arguably best-performing, bank in the world, laid a huge egg with its forecast. They told us the estimates are too high, maybe way too high. That spoiled a big chunk of the market, ultimately dipping 93 points. The S&P inched up 0.54%, but the tech-heavy NASDAQ still gained 0.84%.\u201d\nCramer explained that since the Federal Reserve gave positive signals, investors had shifted away from tech into other areas of the market. This shift was part of the \u201cbroadening out\u201d that many investors had been waiting for, as it was believed to signal a healthier market. Financial stocks, which make up around 13.3% of the S&P 500, had been a source of excitement for those tired of relying on the leading tech stocks.\n\u201cFor the past couple of months, ever since the Fed gave us the all-clear signal, we\u2019ve seen money flow out of tech into long-neglected regions of the stock market. This is the fabled \u201cbroadening out\u201d that people spent all year clamoring for. When we bring in more groups of winners, we\u2019re supposed to have a much healthier market, at least that\u2019s what they say. There are tons of financials in the S&P 500, about 13.3% of the index and the strength in those stocks was a source of much joy for everyone who had gotten sick of The Magnificent Seven.\u201d\nHowever, as Cramer noted, economic uncertainty and disappointing forecasts from bank companies disrupted this broader market strength. Daniel Pinto, the bank company\u2019s COO, dashed hopes by signaling that the outlook for the bank wasn\u2019t as strong as expected. The key issue was that net interest income, a critical measure for banks, was projected to miss expectations due to reduced capital market activity. For Cramer, this underperformance highlighted the danger of moving away from tech stocks too soon.\n\u201cBut a funny thing happened on the way to that broadened-out market: we got economic choppiness. Or to use a more accurate phrase, we got guide-downs that were intolerable to any of the leaders, and the kiss of death to the stock of the bank. You can\u2019t be a leader when you\u2019re slashing your forecast for H2. That\u2019s when the shareholders kick you to the curb and find someone new to follow.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nJim Cramer believes that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s recent revenue shortfall is primarily due to production delays for their new AI chip, Blackwell. He emphasizes that the demand for this chip remains extremely high, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is making progress in addressing the supply issues. Cramer doesn\u2019t see this as a significant setback for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s overall performance.\n\u201cNow, I don\u2019t see much evidence of this, though the bears will point to NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s failure to report a spectacular revenue beat. But that only happened because their new AI chip, Blackwell, got delayed. They\u2019re having trouble producing it at scale, which is totally reasonable. But they\u2019ve basically solved the problem now. It\u2019s a supply problem, not a demand problem. Demand is off the charts.\u201d\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers a strong bullish case, supported by its outstanding financial performance and leadership in AI and GPU technology. In Q2 FY2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) posted remarkable earnings, with revenue soaring to $13.51 billion, a 101% year-over-year increase, largely driven by booming demand for AI and data center products. Notably, data center revenue surged by 171% to $10.32 billion, as businesses ramped up investments in AI infrastructure.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s strategic partnerships with companies like VMware Inc. (NYSE:VMW), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and Hugging Face further bolster its position in the AI ecosystem, while its H100 GPUs continue to set benchmarks in AI model training. New product releases, such as the GeForce RTX 4060 and AI Workbench, reinforce NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s growth across multiple sectors. Looking forward, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) projects even stronger results for Q3 2024, with expected revenue of $16 billion and gross margins between 74.8% and 75.5%.\nAnalysts remain highly optimistic about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s future, driven by its technological dominance and the expanding global demand for AI. This combination of innovation, strategic partnerships, and market leadership makes NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) a compelling investment opportunity.\nOverall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of exclusive stocks Jim Cramer recommends to monitor closely. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure:\u00a0None.

        "Text": "What is Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang's biggest worry?\n\u201cWe have a lot of people on our shoulders, and everybody is counting on us,\u201d Huang said when asked that question by Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference.\n\u201cDemand is so great that delivery of our components, our technology, infrastructure, and software is really emotional for people,\" Huang added. \"Because it directly affects their revenues, it directly affects their competitiveness.\u201d\nInvestors and journalists lined up more than an hour before the session just to catch a glimpse of one of the world's most sought-after CEOs. Huang told the audience that although generative AI is still in its early days, it\u2019ll expand beyond data centers.\n\u201cNow what\u2019s amazing is, so the first trillion dollars of data centers is going to get accelerated and invented this new type of software called generative AI. Generative AI is not just a tool, it\u2019s a skill,\" Huang told Solomon.\n\"For the first time, we\u2019re going to create skills that augment people.\u201d\nFollowing Nvidia's brutal sell-off last week, Huang's keynote was seen as an opportunity to calm investors' nerves.\n\u201cThe infrastructure players like ourselves and all the cloud service providers put the infrastructure in the cloud so that developers can use these machines to train the models and fine-tune the models, guardrail the models,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd the return on that is just fantastic.\u201d\nAccording to Huang, for every dollar a cloud service provider spends with Nvidia, it translates to $5 worth of rentals.\n\u201cI think the days of every line of code being written by software engineers, those are completely over,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThe idea that every one of our software engineers will essentially have companion digital engineers 24/7 \u2014 that\u2019s the future.\u201d\nFor example, Huang shared that Nvidia has 32,000 employees who will be supplemented by \u201chopefully 100x more digital engineers\u201d in the near future.\nNvidia servers \"look expensive, and it could be a couple of million dollars per rack, but it replaces thousands of nodes,\" Huang said. \"The amazing thing is the cables of connecting old, general purpose computing systems cost more than replacing all of those and densifying into one rack.\"\nCompanies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and OpenAI use Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. Despite the tech giant reporting $30 billion in second quarter revenue, its stock fell by more than $200 billion on the same day.\nLast week, Nvidia shed another $400 billion in market value following a Bloomberg report that the Department of Justice subpoenaed the company as part of an antitrust investigation. Nvidia denied the report.\n\u201cWe have inquired with the US Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cNonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.\u201d\nHuang was not asked about the Bloomberg report on Wednesday. And despite the recent sell-off, Nvidia shares are up nearly 150% in the last 12 months.\nHuang also said while training AI models is resource-intensive, it pays off in the long run.\n\u201cOne of the takeaways there is AI isn\u2019t just about training the model, of course; that\u2019s just the first step,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about using the model. And so when you use the model, you save enormous amounts of time \u2014 processing time.\u201d\nHowever, Huang said it\u2019s amazing to watch the AI his company uses to design the chips. \u201cThe part of that that is really intense is just the world on our shoulders,\u201d Huang said. \u201cLess sleep is fine. Three solid hours is all we need.\u201d\nRead more coverage of the 2024 Goldman Sachs Communacopia and technology conference:\nRobinhood can still grow in face of interest rate cuts, says CEO\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang: 'Everybody is counting on us'\nAT&T CEO on Fed rate cuts: They will make our stock look more attractive\nDisney investors are glued to CEO succession outcome: Goldman Sachs analyst\nAmazon Web Services' competitive advantage in AI is its competitors\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. has joined a $100 million-plus funding round for Tokyo startup Sakana AI, one of the larger investments the US chipmaker has made so far in Japan\u2019s fledgling artificial intelligence arena.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis\nWorld's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It\nThe Plan for the World\u2019s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation\nUC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus\nRome May Start Charging Entry to the Trevi Fountain\nSakana, founded in 2023 by a pair of former Google engineers, secured the Series A or early-stage financing led by New Enterprise Associates, Khosla Ventures and Lux Capital. The startup said it will team up with Nvidia on research, data center access and \u201cAI community-building\u201d locally.\nSakana \u2014 which means \u201cfish\u201d in Japanese \u2014 sets out to train low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. Its team unveiled several AI models for Japanese speakers this year, demonstrating how quickly domestic companies can ramp up their capabilities in the sphere.\nNvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he was drawn in particular to Sakana\u2019s endeavors in Japan to popularize AI. His company, which makes the accelerator chips that drive the global development of generative AI, has since 2023 stepped up its pace of startup investment.\n\u201cCountries are embracing sovereign AI to capture and codify their data, culture and language through their own unique large language models,\u201d Huang said in a statement. \u201cThe team at Sakana AI is helping spur the democratization of AI in Japan.\u201d\nThe Asian nation is beginning to draw global attention as an AI market. Microsoft Corp. is investing $2.9 billion over two years to build out the country\u2019s data centers and cloud computing infrastructure, while OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman just opened a Tokyo office. Microsoft is also partnering with SoftBank Corp. on generative AI, while OpenAI is working with Rakuten Group Inc.\nPreviously valued at around $200 million, Sakana\u2019s approach contrasts with those of industry leader OpenAI and others spending billions of dollars training AI on huge datasets. Sakana says its algorithms can help automate the creation of AI models that process language or images by mimicking natural selection when they combine, test and discard data, reducing the amount of human input required.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\u2018They Have Stolen Our Business\u2019: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms\nHow Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company\u2019s Janky Software\nThe Average American Eats 42 Pounds of Cheese a Year, and That Number Could Go Up\nHoward Lutnick Emerges as Trump\u2019s No. 1 Salesman on Wall Street\nJustice Is Beside the Point in America\u2019s Immigration Courts\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Columbia Threadneedle Investments, an investment management company, released its Columbia Contrarian Core Fund second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. Columbia Contrarian Core Fund (Institutional Class shares) returned 5.39% (net of fees) in the quarter compared to the Russell 1000 Index\u2019s 3.57% return.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute and networking solutions. The one-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 3.91%, and its shares gained 185.16% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On September 26, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $124.04 per share with a market capitalization of $3.043 trillion.\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) \u2013 Following the release of first-quarter earnings in May featuring record revenue growth of 262% year over year, NVIDIA continued its upward march. On June 10, shares of the company began trading on a split-adjusted basis following a 10-for-1 forward stock split, making stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors alike. Just one week later, the company officially surpassed Microsoft in market cap to become the most valuable publicly traded company (although it would relinquish the title not long after).

        "Title": "46% of Nvidia's $30 Billion in Q2 Revenue Came From 4 Mystery Customers",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world's leading supplier of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers -- hardware that provides the computing power necessary for the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The chipmaker can't keep up with the enormous demand for its top GPUs, which is driving a growth surge across its business.\nNvidia just reported results for its fiscal 2025 second quarter (which ended July 28), and they topped all expectations with yet another triple-digit percentage increase in revenue led by GPU sales. However, a concerning trend is emerging beneath the surface: Nearly half of the company's Q2 revenue came from just four customers, which appeared to be a big jump from the prior quarter.\nThis indicates that Nvidia is increasingly reliant on a handful of the world's largest technology giants to drive its growth, which makes the company vulnerable if sentiment toward AI starts to shift.\nCloud computing giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) operate numerous centralized data centers filled with servers, leasing computing and storage capacity on those machines to millions of businesses that use it to store data, host websites, develop software, and more.\nNow, those data center operators are bolstering their infrastructure with powerful GPUs and renting the computing capacity to AI developers -- a practice Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says can earn cloud providers $5 in instant hosting revenue over four years for every $1 they spend on Nvidia chips. However, those tech giants are also using their computing capacity to develop their own AI products and services to sell.\nTech companies that don't offer cloud services are also investing heavily in AI data centers. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is using them to develop its autonomous self-driving software, and Nvidia says the automotive industry has been a key driver of GPU sales growth for that reason. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is using Nvidia's chips to expand its Llama open-source large language models (LLMs), which will power several new AI features for Facebook and Instagram.\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the benchmark for the AI industry last year, but during Q2, the company started ramping up shipments of its new H200, which can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of its predecessor. However, all eyes are on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, which will offer even greater performance.\nThe new Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system, for example, will perform AI inference a whopping 30 times faster than the equivalent H100 system. GB200 GPUs are expected to sell for somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000 each, which is similar to the original price of the H100, so they will deliver an incredible improvement in cost efficiency.\nThe GB200 will start shipping in high volumes during its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (beginning in November), and Nvidia anticipates it will generate billions of dollars in revenue in the period.\nNvidia generated $30 billion in revenue during fiscal Q2, which was a 122% increase from the prior-year period, and comfortably above management's forecast of $28 billion. Data center segment sales, which were up by a whopping 154%, accounted for $26.3 billion of that total.\nHowever, according to the company's 10-Q filing for the second quarter, four customers that it did not name accounted for 46% of its $30 billion in revenue.\nCustomer\nProportion Of Nvidia's $30 Billion In Q2 Revenue\nCustomer A\n14%\nCustomer B\n11%\nCustomer C\n11%\nCustomer D\n10%\nData source: Nvidia.\nThe share of concentrated revenue appeared to increase materially from just three months earlier. In its fiscal first quarter, mystery customers A and B together accounted for 24% of total revenue. Nvidia only singles out customers that account for at least 10% of revenue, so it's possible there were other material buyers of its chips in Q1, but they came in shy of the 10% threshold during the period.\nInvestors should pay close attention to this trend because Customer A, for example, spent $4.2 billion with Nvidia during Q2 alone, and an eye-watering $7.8 billion in the first two quarters of fiscal 2025 overall. There are only a small handful of companies in the world that can sustain that kind of spending on chips and infrastructure.\nIn other words, if even two of Nvidia's top customers cut back on their spending, it could lead to a significant drop in its revenue. Nvidia stock has soared by more than 600% since the beginning of 2023, catapulting the company's market capitalization from $360 billion to about $2.6 trillion. Those gains could slowly evaporate if investors become skeptical of Nvidia's ability to generate further sales growth.\nHere's the good news: Nvidia's top four customers are likely some combination of Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Tesla, or even ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and each of them has deep pockets. Based on their public filings, we know most of those companies are spending mind-boggling amounts of money on their data centers.\nMicrosoft spent $55.7 billion on capital expenditures during its fiscal 2024 (which ended June 30), most of which went toward data center infrastructure and chips. The company says it plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025.\nAmazon's capital expenditures during the first half of 2024 alone were $30.5 billion, and it plans to spend even more in the second half to support the growth it's seeing in AI.\nMeta Platforms expects its capital expenditures to come in somewhere between $37 billion and $40 billion for 2024, and it forecasts \"significant growth\" in that number for 2025 to support its AI projects. Meta's Llama 3.1 LLM was trained on 16,000 H100 GPUs, but the company plans to expand its capacity to 600,000 H100 equivalents by the end of this year.\nAlphabet spent $25 billion on capital expenditures in the first half of 2024, and it expects to spend roughly the same in the second half.\nTesla expects to spend a total of $10 billion on capital expenditures in 2024 as it works to bring a cluster of 50,000 GPUs online to advance the development of its self-driving software.\nConsidering that those companies intend to maintain the same infrastructure spending -- or, in the case of Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, increase it -- Nvidia's revenue pipeline looks robust for at least the next year.\nHowever, there is competition coming online. Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices forecasts substantial growth in its data center GPU sales this year. Additionally, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are designing their own AI chips right now, and while it could take years for them to achieve the same level of performance, their efforts pose a risk to Nvidia's longer-term outlook.\nInvestors who own Nvidia stock have no cause for immediate panic, but they should keep a close eye on the company's revenue concentration in upcoming quarters. If it continues to rise, the company could be at a higher risk of experiencing a steep drop-off at some point in the future.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Max Juang ",
        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 5.9% in the afternoon session after market volatility increased (Nasdaq down 2.5%, S&P 500 down 1.5%) following the underwhelming jobs report, which raised more questions about the health of the economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that non-farm Payrolls for the month of August 2024 revealed that the US economy added 142,000 jobs. While the growth represented a significant improvement from the previous month (+89k additions), it fell below the 161,000 consensus forecast. In addition, the unemployment rate clocked in at 4.2%, roughly in line with expectations.\nFollowing the report, the consensus expectation continued to point to a higher probability of a 25 basis points (0.25%) rate cut during the September 2024 Fed policy meeting. Overall, the report offered limited clarity on how the new data might influence the Fed's policy decisions in the coming months, as it presented arguments that could support both bullish and bearish perspectives.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nNvidia\u2019s shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 23 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today\u2019s move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago, when the company dropped 8.3% as the major indices declined (Nasdaq -1.2%, S&P 500 -0.9%). Markets are likely bracing for increased volatility ahead of the Fed's policy decision in September (2024). The consensus expectation is for the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points to 5.00% - 5.25% during the September 2024 meeting. This will be the first rate cut since the committee began raising rates to tackle inflation. Historically, September has been a challenging month for most assets. Notably, since the post-World War II era, major stock indices have consistently recorded significant losses in the month of September relative to other months.\nAdditional data to consider amidst the volatility include the labor market report released in the first week of September, and the CPI report the following week. Given the historical trends and upcoming Fed policy decision, investors may need to prepare for continued market uncertainty and potential downside risk in the weeks ahead.\nNvidia is up 112% since the beginning of the year, but at $102.18 per share it is still trading 24.6% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $22,878.\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "Title": "3 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead of Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "With the attention artificial intelligence (AI) is getting, it's easy to focus on Nvidia as a top tech stock. It's a great pick and has performed incredibly well, but there are other stocks that look more attractive right now.\nThree that I have my eye on are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Procore Technologies (NYSE: PCOR). I think they all offer a great compromise between growth and value, and are far better buys than Nvidia today.\nTaiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC for short, is the largest contract chip manufacturer in the world. It takes designs from giants like Nvidia and Apple and produces them, making it a winner regardless of which company is ahead in the AI race.\nTSMC is at the cutting edge of technology. It has market-leading 3 nanometer (3nm) chips and is already working on its next-generation 2nm chips. These chips can be configured to offer more computing power or be more efficient.\nWith the computing power of existing technology already impressive, it's more likely that TSMC's clients will choose more-efficient versions, especially since the input costs for AI computing hardware are so high. This could drive even more demand for its chips, making the stock a strong buy.\nManagement projects 15% to 20% compound annual revenue growth, which gives it the potential to be a market-crushing stock. With shares still down around 10% from their July highs, now is a great time to buy.\nMeta Platforms is the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Messenger. It also has its Reality Labs division, which offers products like virtual reality headsets.\nBut all investors really need to focus on is its advertising business on its social media sites, which accounts for 98% of revenue. Meta investors just have to learn to balance the benefits of advertising with the high unprofitability of Reality Labs.\nHolistically, Meta is truly an impressive business: 38% operating margins with 22% revenue growth. Those are fantastic metrics, yet the stock trades for 24 times forward earnings. Considering that the S&P 500 as a whole trades for 23 times forward earnings, it's a real bargain because its business is far better than the average S&P 500 constituent.\nMeta is slated to continue its social media dominance, and if one of its Reality Labs products becomes a hit, the stock could be a massive winner.\nProcore is a name you might not have heard of, but its construction management software is revolutionizing the industry. Unlike nearly every other sector that went through a software revolution over the last decade, the construction industry has only recently benefited from widespread cellular connectivity.\nNow that it's possible, Procore's software is incredibly popular since it allows contractors, subcontractors, and project owners to all work from the same information source, reducing extra costs from having to fix errors. So, if an engineer makes a change to the electrical schematic, they can upload it to Procore, and the electrical contractor can access the changes nearly instantly at the jobsite.\nDespite its popularity, Procore has a long way to grow in its target market. In its 2023 investor day presentation, it estimated that it has captured less than 2% of businesses, with about 12% of construction monetary volume. Worldwide, it's even less, with about 1% and 2%, respectively.\nIn light of the industry's size, Procore has the potential to turn into a massive business if it keeps up its growth trajectory. In the second quarter, revenue rose 24% year over year. The business is not profitable but is getting closer each quarter.\nWith its massive runway, it shouldn't be long before Procore starts generating a profit and rewarding its shareholders.\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Christiaan Hetzner ",
        "Text": "Nvidia boss Jensen Huang is starting to feel like Atlas with the weight of the world\u2014or at least AI\u2014bearing down squarely on his shoulders.\nThe CEO and founder of the $2.9 trillion semiconductor giant spoke openly on Wednesday about the tension he\u2019s feeling, offering a glimpse into the pressure he faces to crank up the supply of microchips capable of training the latest AI systems like the\u00a0successor to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.\nCustomers see his products from the perspective of a player in a zero-sum game\u2014each chip they receive means an advantage for them as well as a disadvantage for rivals who struck out. Huang's job is to walk this tightrope, balancing the allocation of supply as best he can in order not to endanger client relationships.\n\u201cDelivery of our components\u2014and our technology, and our infrastructure and software\u2014is really emotional for people, because it directly affects their revenues, it directly affects their competitiveness,\u201d he told a tech conference hosted by Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs.\nWhat Huang exactly meant by \u201cemotional\u201d is unclear, and Nvidia declined to comment further when reached by Fortune. But one thing is certain: Customers\u2014especially the three main cloud hyperscalers, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, which each require a vast supply\u2014realistically have nowhere else to turn. Nvidia controls 90% of the market.\nAs founder and CEO, Huang takes his responsibility to key customers personally. In April, he hand-delivered the world\u2019s first DGX server equipped with its upgraded Hopper series AI training chip, the new H200, to OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman and president Greg Brockman.\nAnd in his quest to topple OpenAI from the industry summit, Elon Musk recently revealed plans to purchase 50,000 H200s over the next few months to double the compute at his\u00a0xAI training cluster\u00a0in Memphis, where his rival AI model, Grok-3, is currently in training.\n\u201cOur fundamental competitiveness depends on being faster than any other AI company. This is the only way to catch up,\u201d Musk explained in a recent social media post. \u201cWhen our fate depends on being the fastest by far, we must have our own hands on the steering wheel, rather than be a backseat driver.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why he was willing to risk the ire of Tesla shareholders after\u00a0allocating Nvidia chips\u00a0to xAI that should have gone to training the carmaker\u2019s self-driving software system, FSD. It also explains how xAI was able to bring online the largest single compute cluster in the world, powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 graphic processing units, in the span of just three months.\nWhether Musk is a preferred customer is not known, but Nvidia has revealed that\u00a0just four data center clients\u00a0were responsible for nearly half of its Q2 top line revenue.\n\u201cIf we could fulfill everybody\u2019s needs, then the emotion would go away, but it\u2019s very emotional, it\u2019s really tense,\u201d Huang told the Goldman conference on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of responsibility on our shoulders and we try to do the best we can.\u201d\nHuang is not being facetious. At the end of last month, Nvidia posted fiscal second-quarter results that Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives called nothing short of \u201cthe most important tech earnings in years.\u201d\nOne of the core concerns that both investors and customers were most keen to hear addressed included any additional information on the rollout and ramp-up of Blackwell, the next series of AI chips after Hopper, following\u00a0reports of delays.\nDuring the investor call, Huang confirmed changes had to be made to the production design template, or \u201cmask,\u201d to improve the yield of chips printed on each silicon wafer. Nonetheless, he insisted he would still be able to ship several billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Blackwell processors before the fiscal fourth quarter ends in late January.\nUnlike integrated device manufacturers like Intel or Texas Instruments, Nvidia outsources all semiconductor fabrication to dedicated foundries that specialize in production technology, primarily TSMC. The\u00a0Taiwanese giant\u00a0leads the industry when it comes to efficiently miniaturizing transistors, the building blocks of the logic chips printed on each wafer.\nThat means, however, that Nvidia cannot quickly reply to demand spikes, especially since these chips go through months of complicated process steps before they are fully fabricated.\nPressed about the issue, Huang told Bloomberg Television late last month that constraints were easing.\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting Q3 to have more supply than Q2, we\u2019re expecting Q4 to have more supply than Q3, and we\u2019re expecting Q1 to have more supply than Q4,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cSo I think our supply condition going into next year will be a large improvement over this last year.\u201d\nIf true, then Huang can finally look forward to fewer tense moments with emotional customers in the not too distant future.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

This model is expected to advance the capabilities of OpenAI in both consumer-facing tools and enterprise applications. Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos. This positions Adobe at the forefront of generative AI for content creation, with a focus on commercial safety by using licensed datasets.\nLooking ahead, Wall Street analysts project significant revenue and earnings growth for key players in the AI space, particularly in semiconductor companies that power AI applications. NVIDIA, for example, is forecast to achieve an impressive 27% annual revenue growth, outperforming both the semiconductor industry and the broader US market. The total revenue for the chipmaker in 2025 is expected to reach around $123 billion, with earnings projected to grow by over 24%\u200b.

The company is a leader in the AI hardware space, controlling nearly 90% of the market for AI GPUs. However, the AI software capabilities of the firm often go under the radar. NVIDIA has a distinct advantage over competitors like Intel and AMD when it comes to AI software offerings. Some examples of this include the CUDA and AI Enterprise software marketed by the chipmaker. The company charges $4,500 per GPU per year for AI software and tech giants that pay for NVIDIA GPUs also pay for these software features in advance. Within the AI software, the firm also markets the DGX Cloud, a cloud service that allows users to train and deploy AI models over the cloud. This service costs a whopping $37,000 per month.\nWall Street analysts have been monitoring NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) closely. Morgan Stanley has an Overweight rating on the shares with a price target of $144.

        "Author": "  Jennifer Sor ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's stock is flashing a sell signal, says strategist Bill Blain.\nBlain cites Nvidia's high valuation and its wealthy employees as reasons to bail.\nHe says the run-up in the chip maker's stock marks the peak of a decadeslong market cycle.\nNvidia's stock is flashing a big \"sell\" sign to investors, according to the veteran strategist Bill Blain.\nBlain, the founder of Wind Shift Capital and a longtime financial strategist, pointed out in a note on Tuesday that Nvidia's sky-high valuation has made many of its employees very wealthy. He referred to a recent poll that found 40% of those who worked at Nvidia had a net worth between $1 million and $20 million, while 37% had a net worth of over $20 million.\nBlain said that leaves less than a third of Nvidia's staff with \"any real daily financial pressure upon them.\"\n\"Do you think that poor quarter of Nvidia peons are really going to bust their guts for guys who are already rich and highly motivated to protect their wealth and position? Do they think Nvidia will rise a further 700%? Will they be happy remaining exceedingly poor relative to their peers and bosses? Or is it more likely the enormous wealth in the office means the poorer but still highly motivated staff are going to figure their wealth chances will be better elsewhere?\" Blain wrote.\nNvidia's enormous valuation could also signal a peak in the broader stock market, Blain said. While investors are pricing in ambitious rate cuts over the next year, policy easing will likely be \"limited\" from the Fed, he said, adding that he believed 4%-6% interest rates would constitute the market's new normal.\n\"Some folk think lower interest rates, as promised by the Fed later this month, spell joy unlimited for markets. (I think it may still be a sell-the-fact moment.)\" Blain said. \"And many, including myself, believe a new long-term economic cycle could reverse the last 40 years of diminished inflationary pressures.\"\nMarkets began their current long-term cycle in 1980s as inflation steadily decreased following a difficult period of inflation during the prior decade, Blain said. He suggested that markets could enter a fresh cycle as soon as 2025, pointing to inflationary pressures stemming from geopolitical tensions, commodities, and the mounting US debt balance.\n\"I just found my best reason to sell Nvidia, confirming we're at the top of the market. What might come next? How about 20-years of rising inflation, rising rates, and a global commodities super-cycle as nations scrabble to secure future strategic resources?\" he added.\nOther strategists have warned of continued inflationary pressures, despite price growth trending downward from its peak in 2022. Inflation could see a resurgence, BlackRock strategists previously predicted, pointing to the risk of a big spike in oil prices, as well as demand outpacing supply in the US economy.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's 10 Stock Picks That Could Change Your Investment Game.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks that could change your investment game according to Jim Cramer.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer points out that tech stocks often perform well when the Federal Reserve maintains high interest rates and the economy slows down. However, when the Fed cuts rates, as it did recently, Wall Street shifts its focus to companies that can show significant earnings growth due to these lower rates. This may seem confusing, but in the stock market, cash is limited, and it's currently flowing into companies that would struggle without the rate cuts. While many stocks initially rose after the cut, they couldn't maintain those gains, leading to a market decline.\n\"The thing is, these tech stocks tend to be winners when the Fed keeps rates high and the economy slows. But when the Fed slams on the accelerator, as it did today, Wall Street bands together and piles into the companies that can post big earnings gains with much lower interest rates. Now, that may sound strange to you. Obviously, the real world makes no distinction between a company that does well all the time and one that does extremely well some of the time.\nCramer questions whether all tech stocks are now weaker and suggests that not every company will suffer the same fate. He believes there are still standout stocks in the tech sector that can thrive regardless of economic conditions, even if they don\u2019t perform well on days when the market dips. These companies help larger businesses operate more efficiently, and there's always a demand for that kind of support, indicating that some tech players will continue to shine.\n\"So, is every player doomed to the same small part? Are the stocks of all tech companies weaker now? Can nothing transcend that status? Like when I went out for Bye Bye Birdie or Guys and Dolls in high school, I mean, first, no publicly traded company would ever be that low. I was totally expendable, other than as Lieutenant Rooney in ARS Gold Lace, where I don't think I ever spoke more than a few words.\nJim Cramer also highlights that artificial intelligence is a crucial factor in today's market. Companies using AI can enhance their profit margins, increasing earnings even amid declining sales. This indicates that AI can drive profitability without needing to boost sales.\nOur Methodology\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Mad Money episode, in which he analyzed several stocks. We selected 12 companies and ranked them by their ownership levels among hedge funds, beginning with those that are least owned and moving to those that are most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nJim Cramer highlighted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s ambition to create more powerful chips that can accomplish incredible tasks. He noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has already achieved significant breakthroughs in this field, showcasing its innovative capabilities.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s strong outlook is backed by its impressive Q2 2024 earnings, which exceeded analyst expectations and showed record revenue growth due to high demand for its GPUs in data centers and AI applications. As a leader in AI hardware and software,NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are essential for training and running AI models, positioning the company for ongoing growth as AI adoption increases across industries.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also enhancing its product offerings with innovations like the Hopper and Grace architectures, which improve performance for AI and high-performance computing tasks. Strategic partnerships with major tech companies help NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expand its influence in areas such as autonomous vehicles, cloud computing, and gaming.\nWith rising investments in AI and machine learning, analysts have raised their price targets for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reflecting positive expectations for its growth. Recent announcements about major contracts and advancements in AI technology have further boosted investor confidence, creating a strong bullish outlook for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the stocks that could change your investment game according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was among the tech stocks plunging today after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported cooler-than-expected job growth in August. Just 142,000 jobs were added last month, below expectations at 161,000, and readings from June and July were revised downward as well.\nThe news led investors to believe that the economy was weakening faster than expected, which could be particularly damaging for growth and tech stocks like Nvidia that are relying on billions in infrastructure spending to advance new generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.\nAs a result, tech stocks were down broadly with the Nasdaq Composite down 2.3% as of 1:19 p.m. ET, and Nvidia was off 4% at the same time after falling as much as 5.8% earlier in the session. The iShares Semiconductor ETF was down 4% as well, showing the chip sector was broadly impacted.\nIt's been a rough week for the AI chip leader. The stock plunged on Tuesday, seemingly because of rumors that the Justice Department had issued it a subpoena related to an antitrust investigation, though Nvidia later said that wasn't true.\nStill, today's pullback shows that the stock is sensitive to the broader macro environment. Investors apparently believe that a recession or an economic slowdown could slam the brakes on the AI boom as it would deter big tech companies and start-ups from investing in the new technology.\nThat would be a problem for Nvidia as its business and its lofty valuation is based on soaring demand for its data center GPU components, which are highly valued for their ability to run complex AI models.\nThe jobs report is just one data point of many, and while there are other signs that the economy is weakening, it doesn't look like a recession is around the corner -- the unemployment rate is still low at 4.2%.\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates later this month, which should give a boost to Nvidia and the broader economy.\nThe stock did fall after its earnings report last week, but its overall numbers were strong. The business continues to grow exceptionally fast, and it expects to ramp up production of its new Blackwell platform, which is already seeing strong demand, in Q4.\nFinally, Nvidia's biggest customers, like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, are unlikely to be fazed by a hiccup in the economy as these companies are sitting on tens of billions of dollars in cash and have all declared that investing in AI infrastructure is a top priority.\nIt would likely take a significant economic crash to derail their investment plans, meaning Nvidia is more protected from economic volatility than it may seem. That's a good reason to bet on the stock recovering from today's slide.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Kayode Omotosho ",
        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 6.8% in the afternoon session after markets rebounded (Nasdaq up 1.8%, S&P 500 up 0.8%) after shaking off the initial negative reaction to the August inflation report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report revealed that CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) for the month of August 2024 came in line with expectations, growing 0.2% month on month.\nA concerning aspect of the report lies in the core CPI (which excludes food and energy prices), which revealed a 0.3% increase from the previous month, slightly exceeding the expected 0.2%. Despite this, annual inflation seemed to be easing, rising by 2.5%, the lowest level since February 2021. The improved market sentiment suggests investors still very strongly believe that the Fed will cut rates later this month.\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. The result of lower interest rates, all else equal, is higher stock valuations. This is especially true for higher-growth stocks such as those in the technology sector, where the current value depends more on cash flows many years out in the future.\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nNvidia\u2019s shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 23 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today\u2019s move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago, when the company dropped 5.9% as market volatility increased (Nasdaq down 2.5%, S&P 500 down 1.5%) following the underwhelming jobs report, which raised more questions about the health of the economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that non-farm Payrolls for the month of August 2024 revealed that the US economy added 142,000 jobs. While the growth represented a significant improvement from the previous month (+89k additions), it fell below the 161,000 consensus forecast.\nIn addition, the unemployment rate clocked in at 4.2%, roughly in line with expectations. Following the report, the consensus expectation continued to point to a higher probability of a 25 basis points (0.25%) rate cut during the September 2024 Fed policy meeting.\nOverall, the report offered limited clarity on how the new data might influence the Fed's policy decisions in the coming months, as it presented arguments that could support both bullish and bearish perspectives.\nNvidia is up 143% since the beginning of the year, but at $116.83 per share it is still trading 13.8% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $25,348.\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n"

        "Title": "Vistra Surpasses NVIDIA as S&P 500's Top Stock in 2024: Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Tirthankar Chakraborty ",
        "Text": "This year, Vistra Corp.\u2019s VST strong rally could potentially hinder NVIDIA Corporation NVDA from becoming the S&P 500\u2019s top annual performer back to back, a title held only by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD since 1999.\nHowever, Vistra\u2019s stupendous gains have made the stock pricey. So, let\u2019s look at how to trade the VST stock.\nWall Street darling NVIDIA squashed bubble fears and witnessed a meteoric rise this year with the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI).\nShipment of the much-awaited next-generation Blackwell chips by the end of the year and sheer dominance in the graphic processing units (GPU) market has given the magnificent 7 stock an edge over its peers.\nMost importantly, NVIDIA stock got a boost from the Federal Reserve\u2019s major interest rate cuts. Lower interest rates don\u2019t affect NVIDIA\u2019s crucial cash flows for growth. Also, lower borrowing costs boost its profit margins (read more: Post-Fed Rate Cut: Buy, Hold, or Sell NVIDIA Stock?).\nAs a result, NVIDIA\u2019s shares have soared 134.8% this year and remained the S&P 500\u2019s top performer for quite some time. However, Vistra, a not-so-household name, toppled NVIDIA last week to become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500, an index it joined not long ago.\nThe change in the top position took place as investors showed keen interest in an electric company rather than semiconductor stocks to play the boom in AI.\nVistra shares scaled upward for its nuclear power business and high demand from power-consuming AI data centers. Vistra is poised to capitalize on AI data center power needs with its exclusive gas and nuclear power plants mix.\nThe Vistra stock climbed 189.8% year to date, while its peers trailed, with the Utility - Electric Power industry soaring 17.2%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIt\u2019s just not power requirements for data centers that are propelling Vistra shares upward. According to analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Jefferies, Vistra stands to gain from an increase in power prices, increased plant usage and likely contracts with data centers. Hence, the $4.78 Zacks Consensus Estimate for VST\u2019s earnings per share is up 8.9% year over year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nVistra has also generated profits significantly, which boosted its share price. After all, the VST stock has a return on equity (ROE) of 21.1%, more than the industry\u2019s 10.4%. Any ROE above 20% is considered to be very strong.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBanking on the AI boom, increase in wholesale power prices and potential to generate profits competently not only helped Vistra to be the top performer in the S&P 500 but also will boost its shares further. Anyhow, the VST stock is trading above the 200-day moving average this year, indicating a long-term uptrend.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nProminent brokers have also increased the average short-term price target of VST by 6.6% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $107.88. The highest price target is at $133, an upside of 23.3%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThus, those who have invested in the VST stock should stick to it and capitalize on the strong price upside trend. But if you are thinking of buying the stock now, it may burn a hole in your pocket! This is because, per price/earnings, the VST stock, presently, trades at 23.3X forward earnings. However, the industry\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 17.4X. So, better wait for an opportune moment to invest in the VST stock.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nVistra currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the US-China tech war remain major concerns.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past year (+80.9% vs. +21.8%).

Consumer spending on travel and entertainment, which carries higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well.American Express\u2019 solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividends.However, with higher utilization of AXP\u2019s cards, costs in the form of card member services and card member rewards are likely to go up. Rising marketing costs are straining its margins. Its current debt level amid a high-interest rate environment induces a rise in interest expenses. The stock is overvalued at the moment. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on American Express here >>>)Wells Fargo\u2019s shares have underperformed the Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (-1.4% vs. +6.2%). The company\u2019s loan growth is likely to remain limited, as the asset cap remains in place until it complies fully with regulators\u2019 demands regarding operational risk management.The bank agreed to divest its non-agency third-party servicing segment of the Commercial Mortgage Servicing (CMS) business to Trimont. High mortgage rates and low originations is likely to hurt mortgage banking income in the near term.Nevertheless, its progress on efficiency initiatives, like branch and footprint reduction, will support cost reduction and drive bottom-line growth. A decent deposit balance is likely to aid its financials, driven by the strength in the Consumer Banking and Lending segment. With a strong capital position and decent liquid profile, the capital distribution seems sustainable.(You can read the full research report on Wells Fargo here >>>)Shares of Elite Pharmaceuticals have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry over the year-to-date period (+177.9% vs. -0.5%).

Its recent facility expansion enhances manufacturing capacity, supporting future product launches.A robust pipeline and favorable generics market dynamics support long-term prospects. Elite Pharmaceuticals boasts positive cash flows, low debt and a solid cash position.However, risks include customer concentration, pricing pressure from large buyers, intense competition, and regulatory challenges related to controlled substances. Supply chain vulnerabilities and potential overextension in product launches are other concerns.(You can read the full research report on Elite Pharmaceuticals here >>>)PrimeEnergy Resources\u2019 shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry over the year-to-date period (+30.3% vs. -4.1%).

Favorable oil prices and strategic acreage in the Permian Basin offer long-term growth potential.However, risks include exposure to volatile oil and gas prices, rising production costs, heavy capital expenditures and dependency on a limited number of partners.

He's known for, among other things, taking a contrarian approach to investing, zigging while others are zagging.\nTepper's latest moves are an excellent example of that philosophy. In the second quarter, Appaloosa Management dumped shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), arguably the most popular stock on the market, and piled into some of the most beaten-down, unloved stocks available. Take a closer look.\nTepper's fund dumped 3.73 million shares of Nvidia, or roughly $450 million worth of the top artificial intelligence (AI) stock, in Q2. That wasn't quite all of Appaloosa's stake. But it was more than 84% of it, leaving the fund with just 690,000 shares, representing roughly $90 million worth of the stock.\nThe Appaloosa boss hasn't directly commented on selling Nvidia, but he's one of several billionaire hedge fund managers to do so in Q2. Many seem to believe that the so-called easy money has been made with Nvidia. Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller also sold the stock recently, saying that the market now recognizes what he recognized at the start of the AI boom.\nFor Tepper, the Q2 sale continued a pattern. He dumped 3.48 million shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, even as the stock surged over that period.\nAppaloosa also sold a number of other chip stocks in Q2, indicating a broader rotation out of the sector. Among those it sold were Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. It also trimmed its position in \"AI stocks\" like Amazon, Oracle, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms.\nHowever, what Tepper was buying instead was even more surprising.\nChina stocks have been in trouble for the last five years, falling sharply from their pandemic peak. A crackdown on the tech sector by Beijing and a weak recovery post-COVID have combined to make the sector a laggard.\nIn fact, as the chart below shows, the iShares MSCI China ETF is down 12% over the last five years, getting trounced by the S&P 500, which has nearly doubled in that time.\nHowever, Appaloosa seems to smell an opportunity in China, as the fund bought a number of Chinese stocks in Q2.\nAppaloosa added more than 1 million shares of the Kraneshares CSI China Internet ETF (NYSEMKT: KWEB), which counts Tencent and Alibaba as its top two holdings.\nThe fund also added more than 660,000 shares of leading e-commerce stock JD.com, 565,000 shares of the iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSEMKT: FXI), and 380,000 shares of KE Holdings, a Chinese real estate services company.\nThough Appaloosa actually trimmed its stake in Alibaba, that Chinese e-commerce stock remained his top holding, making up 12.2% of the Appaloosa portfolio.\nThe fund first bought shares of Alibaba in Q2 2022. He's acquired the other Chinese stocks more recently, mostly within the last year.\nTepper hasn't explained his bullishness on China, but he likely thinks the sector is oversold and due for a recovery.\nAnyone with a bullish bet on China got some good news on Tuesday when Chinese stocks soared on surprise interest rate cuts, the government's biggest effort to stimulate the economy since the pandemic.\nIndeed, Chinese stocks jumped on the news. The iShares MSCI China ETF was up 9% in afternoon trading, showing perhaps greater upside potential in the sector.\nThe Chinese economy is still generally weak, but the rate cuts could be a sign that the government plans to do more to boost that economy. Even so, most Chinese stocks, like Alibaba and JD.com, have put up underwhelming growth numbers in recent quarters, which is why the stocks have generally lagged.\nTepper and his team at Appaloosa seem to believe that those stocks have hit rock bottom, and any good news would prompt a turnaround. That theory seems reasonable, but investors have been saying that for years, and China has continued to struggle.\nRate cuts notwithstanding, investors still seem better off exercising cautiousness in China. Beijing is unpredictable, the economy is lagging, and new chip export restrictions from the U.S. and others could further impair its recovery.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia\u2019s incredible rise has been powered by 3 crucial but overlooked factors",
        "Author": "  Geoff Colvin ",
        "Text": "In the fevered run-up to the most overhyped quarterly earnings announcement in recent years\u2014Nvidia\u2019s, of course\u2014it\u2019s hard to believe that anything of relevance was left unsaid. But in fact three crucial elements of the Nvidia story were underplayed or ignored. Without understanding them, envisioning the company\u2019s future is hopeless.\nThe company\u2019s profit for the second quarter was a staggering 168% greater than profit for the same quarter last year. If Nvidia just earned that same profit for the year\u2019s two remaining quarters, it would be the fourth most profitable company in the Fortune 500 (behind only Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet, and Microsoft). But Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia\u2019s profits to continue growing strongly this year\u2014and on average the analysts have underestimated Nvidia\u2019s performance so far.\nEven more impressive is Nvidia\u2019s profitability on multiple measures. I have long preferred measures based on economic profit, also known as economic value added (EVA), which eliminates distortions in standard accounting. Institutional Shareholder Services calculates EVA data for 21,000 publicly traded companies worldwide, and it reports that Nvidia\u2019s returns on capital and its upward trend put it in the 100th percentile for profitability. That doesn\u2019t mean Nvidia is in the top percentile (which would be the 99th percentile). It means Nvidia ranks above all those other 21,000 companies, or possibly ties with some of them.\nThat is simply phenomenal. When Nvidia\u2019s profit growth slows down, as eventually it must, the company could still rank in the 95th percentile\u2014or heck, even in that shabby 85th percentile\u2014and remain an extraordinary financial performer.\nHuang made news in March when he spoke to students at his alma mater, Stanford University. \u201cGreatness is not intelligence,\u201d he told them. \u201cGreatness comes from character, and character isn\u2019t formed out of smart people. It\u2019s formed out of people who suffered.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t go into much personal detail at that event, though he has often mentioned that he was a dishwasher at Denny\u2019s, \u201cand then they promoted me to busboy.\u201d But he was much more open about his formative years when he spoke to Fortune 23 years ago:\nIn 1973, the 9-year-old Huang was living in Thailand with his Chinese parents. Worried about the political situation there, his parents decided to send him to a U.S. boarding school his uncle had found in a magazine ad. Before long Huang was enrolled in the Oneida Baptist Institute in Oneida, Ky. It turned out the institute was a school for troubled kids. Huang's 17-year-old roommate was fresh out of prison and covered with stab wounds. Huang says that during his two years at the school he got beat up a lot and spent afternoons cleaning the latrine. Nonetheless, he looks on those days as a valuable experience. \"Now I don't get scared often. I don't worry about going places I haven't gone before,\" says Huang, \"and I can tolerate a lot of discomfort.\"\nSuffering remains central to Huang\u2019s leadership. \u201cTo this day I use the phrase \u2018pain and suffering\u2019 inside our company with great glee,\u201d he told Stanford students. \u201cYou want to refine the character of your company. You want greatness out of them.\u201d\nCEOs often complain that Wall Street won\u2019t let them embark on long-term projects that will yield profits only far in the future. Huang has insisted on pursuing such projects anyway. Investors should know that Nvidia\u2019s history is a story of spending years to create technology for which there is no market until the technology creates a market.\nNvidia\u2019s first project was designing chips to create 3D graphics for video games when video games barely existed. Eventually the chips turbocharged the games industry and made Nvidia successful. Huang and his partners knew that same technology could do much more, including powering a new way of computing that became AI. But \u201cfor 10, 15 years, the markets that fuel Nvidia today just didn\u2019t exist,\u201d says Huang. \u201cAll your shareholders, your board of directors, your partners\u2014you\u2019re taking everybody with you, and there\u2019s no evidence of a market. That is really, really challenging.\u201d\nHuang\u2019s experience is a warning to Nvidia investors that some day after today\u2019s AI frenzy, the time may come when they must be patient. It\u2019s also an inspiration to business leaders that pain and suffering will yield dividends, and that persistence and confidence can pay off, sometimes spectacularly.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\nTop 5 Upgrades: \nBarclays upgraded Victoria's Secret (VSCO) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $25, up from $23. The firm sees a balanced risk versus reward for the shares given new leadership, \"sufficiently low\" second half of 2024 consensus expectations, and a return to the brand's \"core heritage and strengths in intimates.\"\nBTIG upgraded GE HealthCare (GEHC) to Buy from Neutral with a $100 price target. GE HealthCare enters the second half of 2024 with a lower bar and faces easier compares in the first half of 2024, contends BTIG.\nBarclays upgraded VF Corp. (VFC) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $22, up from $19. The firm believes the stock's risk/reward is attractive at current levels.\nGuggenheim upgraded Sirius XM (SIRI) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $30, up from $29. Core operating trends and free cash flow remain stable, while subscriber trends are set to improve, the firm tells investors.\nJefferies upgraded Extra Space Storage (EXR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $204, up from $162. The firm anticipates peer-leading sane-store revenue growth as the company closes the 9% gap between Life Storage and Extra Space rents.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nJefferies downgraded Edwards Lifesciences (EW) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $70, down from $85. The firm sees modest TAVR growth continuing for Edwards.\nWolfe Research downgraded ResMed (RMD) to Underperform from Peer Perform with an $180 price target. The firm says this is a risk/reward call triggered by its physician survey work.\nTruist downgraded Incyte (INCY) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $74, down from $83. The company's efforts to offset the Jakafi patent cliff failed, and its oncology programs are \"encouraging but early\" or in highly a competitive space, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nBofA downgraded Cencora (COR) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $245, down from $275. Industry growth is normalizing, and the competitive dynamics are shifting following years of stable end markets in drug distribution and tailwinds from COVID, the firm tells investors.\nBarclays downgraded Portland General Electric (POR) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $49, up from $48. The firm sees more limited consensus earnings revision potential and less upside to the shares after factoring in the company's $1.5B of additional capex.\nTop 5 Initiations: \nWilliam Blair initiated coverage of Nvidia (NVDA) with an Outperform rating. Nvidia's data center revenue grew 217% in fiscal 2024 and is expected to grow 132% in fiscal 2025, exceeding $110B in revenue from $15B in fiscal 2023, the firm noted.\nWilliam Blair initiated coverage of Arm (ARM) with an Outperform rating. Blair believes Arm's royalty/licensing revenue model drives best-in-class profitability.\nWilliam Blair initiated coverage of Broadcom (AVGO) with an Outperform rating. Broadcom is targeting $12B in AI revenue in FY24 and the firm sees room for continued steady growth into FY25 and FY26 driven by increasing custom chip demand, improved software monetization, recovery in non-AI semi chips and accelerating growth of Ethernet AI network fabrics, the firm tells investors.\nNeedham initiated coverage of Supermicro (SMCI) with a Buy rating and $600 price target. The firm views Supermicro as a first mover in the design of GPU-based compute systems and liquid cooled rack level solutions and \"significant beneficiary\" from growing investment in AI infrastructure.\nHSBC initiated coverage of KKR (KKR) with a Buy rating and $148 price target. The firm thinks the market \"underappreciates its significant earnings growth prospects.\" \n"

        "Title": "Jim Cramer Highlights NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) As A Standout Despite Recent Negativity Surrounding Its Performance",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 10 Stocks to Track for Potential Growth. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among Jim Cramer's top stocks to track for potential growth.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised investors to hold onto their stocks, anticipating a rebound after the market\u2019s downturn. This advice proved useful as the Dow rose by 484 points or 1.16% and the NASDAQ also climbed by 1.16%, indicating that selling during the market decline was not the best choice.\n\u201cLast week, I advised you to hold off on selling everything and just wait, as I believed that once the pain ended, we would see a rebound. The average investor saw gains, with the Dow up 484 points, or 1.16%, and the NASDAQ also climbing 1.16%. While it might not be a full recovery, it shows that selling into Friday\u2019s downturn wasn\u2019t the best strategy.\u201d\nJim Cramer noted that the previous week was tough for economically sensitive and tech stocks, despite a mixed August employment report. This report suggested a balanced economic outlook, not too strong or weak, which initially seemed favorable for those hoping for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite this, Wall Street reacted negatively, shifting away from cyclical stocks to more recession-proof sectors like consumer goods and pharmaceuticals, with industries such as industrials and semiconductors being particularly affected.\nCramer observed that recession-proof stocks, such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices, have performed well recently but have seen significant gains, raising concerns about a potential correction.\n\u201cToday, recession-proof stocks like pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform well, which is dangerous as these stocks have seen parabolic gains and could be due for a correction.\u201d\nHe highlighted that historically, when the Federal Reserve is about to cut rates, it signals a shift in investment strategy. With the Fed expected to ease rates soon, Cramer suggests investors consider moving away from recession-proof stocks and look into more cyclical companies that could benefit from economic stimulus. While investing in cyclical stocks during a downturn is challenging, the anticipated rate cuts could make these stocks more attractive. Cramer advises maintaining diversification but being ready to adjust investment strategies based on the economic outlook.\n\u201cHistorically, when the Fed is about to start cutting rates, we know that it\u2019s time to shift focus. With the Fed leaning towards easing and an expected rate cut next week, it\u2019s time to consider moving away from recession-proof stocks and investing in more cyclical companies. While it\u2019s challenging to buy cyclical stocks during a slowdown, anticipating that the Fed will boost the economy can make them strong investment opportunities. It\u2019s important to maintain diversification but be ready to adjust as needed.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nThis article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer\u2019s Mad Money, where he talked about several stocks. From there, we picked ten companies and discussed how hedge funds are investing in them. Finally, we rank these companies from those least owned to those most owned by hedge funds.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nJim Cramer highlights NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a standout despite recent negativity surrounding its performance. After a strong earnings report, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell from $126 to $102, with many investors misunderstanding the company\u2019s potential and even mispronouncing its name. This week, those who sold in panic might be regretting their decision.\nCramer notes that demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s new Blackwell supercomputer chipset is so high that CEO Jensen Huang mentioned customers are becoming \u201cemotional about allocation,\u201d indicating strong demand rather than a shortage. Additionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s use of accelerated computing with its advanced GPUs offers significant energy efficiency and cost advantages compared to traditional CPUs from companies like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\u201cNaturally, saving the best for last: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). We got a huge quarter from them last month, yet all we heard was how disappointing the numbers were. Yeah, cancel the watch parties for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), no more tailgating. The stock was trading around $126 before the quarter and fell to $102 at its lows last week. The world had given up on it, but they didn\u2019t even know why or how. They didn\u2019t even know what NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does. They certainly can\u2019t pronounce it\u2014they say it like Nivea cream.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a top investment pick due to its strong position in the AI sector, impressive financial performance, and growing presence in data centers. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) leads in AI hardware with its powerful GPUs, like the A100 and H100, which are crucial for AI model training and inference. This leadership has significantly boosted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s revenue.\nIn Q2 FY2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) exceeded expectations with revenue reaching $26 billion, a 206% increase from the previous year, and an EPS of $4.02. The demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s AI chips remains high, with growth expected to continue in data centers and AI applications through 2025 and beyond. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s strategy to diversify its data center revenue across different sectors and regions strengthens its growth prospects.\nWhile high valuation and potential fluctuations in AI demand are risks, Wall Street\u2019s strong buy ratings and price targets up to $1,200 reflect NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s potential for significant returns, making it an attractive investment in AI and accelerated computing.\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor\u00a0letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on the list of Jim Cramer's top stocks to track for potential growth. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 10 Stocks to Track for Potential Growth. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among Jim Cramer's top stocks to track for potential growth.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised investors to hold onto their stocks, anticipating a rebound after the market\u2019s downturn. This advice proved useful as the Dow rose by 484 points or 1.16% and the NASDAQ also climbed by 1.16%, indicating that selling during the market decline was not the best choice.\n\u201cLast week, I advised you to hold off on selling everything and just wait, as I believed that once the pain ended, we would see a rebound. The average investor saw gains, with the Dow up 484 points, or 1.16%, and the NASDAQ also climbing 1.16%. While it might not be a full recovery, it shows that selling into Friday\u2019s downturn wasn\u2019t the best strategy.\u201d\nJim Cramer noted that the previous week was tough for economically sensitive and tech stocks, despite a mixed August employment report. This report suggested a balanced economic outlook, not too strong or weak, which initially seemed favorable for those hoping for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite this, Wall Street reacted negatively, shifting away from cyclical stocks to more recession-proof sectors like consumer goods and pharmaceuticals, with industries such as industrials and semiconductors being particularly affected.\nCramer observed that recession-proof stocks, such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices, have performed well recently but have seen significant gains, raising concerns about a potential correction.\n\u201cToday, recession-proof stocks like pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform well, which is dangerous as these stocks have seen parabolic gains and could be due for a correction.\u201d\nHe highlighted that historically, when the Federal Reserve is about to cut rates, it signals a shift in investment strategy. With the Fed expected to ease rates soon, Cramer suggests investors consider moving away from recession-proof stocks and look into more cyclical companies that could benefit from economic stimulus. While investing in cyclical stocks during a downturn is challenging, the anticipated rate cuts could make these stocks more attractive. Cramer advises maintaining diversification but being ready to adjust investment strategies based on the economic outlook.\n\u201cHistorically, when the Fed is about to start cutting rates, we know that it\u2019s time to shift focus. With the Fed leaning towards easing and an expected rate cut next week, it\u2019s time to consider moving away from recession-proof stocks and investing in more cyclical companies. While it\u2019s challenging to buy cyclical stocks during a slowdown, anticipating that the Fed will boost the economy can make them strong investment opportunities. It\u2019s important to maintain diversification but be ready to adjust as needed.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nThis article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer\u2019s Mad Money, where he talked about several stocks. From there, we picked ten companies and discussed how hedge funds are investing in them. Finally, we rank these companies from those least owned to those most owned by hedge funds.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nJim Cramer highlights NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a standout despite recent negativity surrounding its performance. After a strong earnings report, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell from $126 to $102, with many investors misunderstanding the company\u2019s potential and even mispronouncing its name. This week, those who sold in panic might be regretting their decision.\nCramer notes that demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s new Blackwell supercomputer chipset is so high that CEO Jensen Huang mentioned customers are becoming \u201cemotional about allocation,\u201d indicating strong demand rather than a shortage. Additionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s use of accelerated computing with its advanced GPUs offers significant energy efficiency and cost advantages compared to traditional CPUs from companies like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\u201cNaturally, saving the best for last: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). We got a huge quarter from them last month, yet all we heard was how disappointing the numbers were. Yeah, cancel the watch parties for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), no more tailgating. The stock was trading around $126 before the quarter and fell to $102 at its lows last week. The world had given up on it, but they didn\u2019t even know why or how. They didn\u2019t even know what NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does. They certainly can\u2019t pronounce it\u2014they say it like Nivea cream.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a top investment pick due to its strong position in the AI sector, impressive financial performance, and growing presence in data centers. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) leads in AI hardware with its powerful GPUs, like the A100 and H100, which are crucial for AI model training and inference. This leadership has significantly boosted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s revenue.\nIn Q2 FY2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) exceeded expectations with revenue reaching $26 billion, a 206% increase from the previous year, and an EPS of $4.02. The demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s AI chips remains high, with growth expected to continue in data centers and AI applications through 2025 and beyond. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s strategy to diversify its data center revenue across different sectors and regions strengthens its growth prospects.\nWhile high valuation and potential fluctuations in AI demand are risks, Wall Street\u2019s strong buy ratings and price targets up to $1,200 reflect NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s potential for significant returns, making it an attractive investment in AI and accelerated computing.\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor\u00a0letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs).

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It doesn't take an investing genius to know that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a huge winner from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The surging demand for graphics pressing units (GPUs) -- driven largely by AI -- has made Nvidia one of the largest companies on the planet.\nCan Nvidia grow even bigger? Yep. The chip giant sees a $1 trillion opportunity ahead -- and it's not AI.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in his company's second-quarter earnings call in August, \"[T]he world is moving from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion worth of data centers. $1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing.\" He added later in the call, \"We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize $1 trillion worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing.\"\nIs further AI demand needed to facilitate this transition to accelerated computing? Huang doesn't think so.\nHe spoke on Sept. 11, 2024, at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference. In his remarks, Huang imagined a scenario where AI didn't exist. He said, \"Well, in the world where there's no AI at all, general-purpose computing has run out of steam still.\"\nHuang argued that \"Moore's Law is over\" -- a reference to the principle espoused by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the speed of computers will double every two years. He maintained that the physical limits of fabricating semiconductors will get in the way.\nThe solution to the problem in Huang's view, is accelerated computing. And no company beats Nvidia at designing the GPUs required to make accelerated computing possible.\nOf course, we don't live in a hypothetical world where AI doesn't exist. In the real world, AI is accelerating the shift to accelerated computing. Nvidia continues to add fuel to this fire.\nThe company's new Blackwell GPU architecture will enable building and running large language models (LLMs) with 1 trillion parameters at up to 25 times lower cost and energy consumption than the current gold standard Hopper platform. Unsurprisingly, Huang said in Nvidia's Q2 earnings call that \"the demand for Blackwell is incredible.\"\nBut AI won't just speed up the transition of existing data centers that use general-purpose computing to new ones that use accelerated computing; it will also likely continue to drive the construction of more data centers. These new data centers will be what Nvidia calls \"AI factories\" with data and electricity as raw materials and AI as the product.\nLook for Nvidia to continue pouring fuel on the fire. The company is now in a \"one-year rhythm\" of introducing new GPU technology. As Huang said earlier this year, [A]fter Blackwell... we have other Blackwells coming.\"\nDoes Nvidia's $1 trillion opportunity make the stock a no-brainer buy? Maybe, although it's not a slam dunk.\nFor one thing, it could take much longer than Huang envisions for existing data centers to transition to accelerated computing. The surge in AI-related demand could taper off. Nvidia might not capture as much of the data center market as it hopes.\nInvestors should also recognize that significant growth prospects are already baked into Nvidia's share price. The stock trades at 29.3 times trailing 12-month sales and 40 times forward earnings.\nBut the general premise of Huang's case for Nvidia's $1 trillion opportunity seems reasonable. Whether or not you think Nvidia stock is a no-brainer buy, it should still deliver exceptional gains for long-term investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Laura Bratton    ",
        "Text": "AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led the tech stock rally Thursday following the Federal Reserve\u2019s sizable 50 basis point interest rate cut. Nvidia stock jumped more than 5%, while its rival Advanced Micro Devices saw shares rise as much as 7% in afternoon trading, before edging down slightly to close the day.\nThe rising stock prices illustrate that investors are absorbing \u2014 and believing \u2014 Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s message that the US economy is \u201cin good shape.\u201d The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) led the stock market\u2019s upward trajectory. The index rose 2.5%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.7% and the Dow (^DJI) climbed 1.3%.\nThe so-called Magnificent Seven Big Tech stocks all posted gains. Meta (META) stock rose 4%; Apple (AAPL) jumped 3.7%. Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) all bumped up nearly 2%. But the semiconductor subsector of the tech industry was a top gainer. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) climbed nearly 5%.\nNvidia\u2019s climb is welcome news to investors who watched the stock\u2019s roller-coaster ride in recent weeks. The chipmaker's shares fell after the company reported its fiscal second quarter earnings at the end of August, beating Wall Street\u2019s expectations but lowering its projected gross margin for the full year.\nThe stock tumbled further upon news that the Department of Justice sent subpoenas to Nvidia as the agency ramped up its antitrust investigation of the company. But it jumped again after CEO Jensen Huang successfully pitched investors on AI\u2019s return on investment during a Goldman Sachs conference last week, and big names like Oracle chief technology officer Larry Ellison and Elon Musk have reportedly \u201cbegged\u201d for more Nvidia AI chips.\nAnd while Nvidia\u2019s stock price may be down about 12% from three months ago, it\u2019s up a staggering 172% from this time last year. The semiconductor superpower has continued to benefit from the AI boom, which is proving to be more than just hype.\nAlthough Nvidia dominates the market for AI hardware, AMD is also a major beneficiary of the AI innovation wave. While the stock has faced ups and downs throughout the last year and has come down from record highs in March, shares are up nearly 55% from last year.\nAMD in late June posted second quarter profits up nearly 20% from the prior year. The company will report third quarter results in late October.\nThe semiconductor sector\u2019s good day is a bright spot as it faces uncertainty with the US presidential election inching closer. Both presidential candidates\u2019 tough-on-China stances would be bad news for American chip companies like Nvidia. The Biden administration implemented tough export controls banning Chinese companies from directly buying chips from Nvidia and AMD in 2022.\nThe US introduced further restrictions regarding semiconductor and quantum computing exports earlier this month. In the meantime, Nvidia is working on a custom chip for Chinese customers that complies with current trade restrictions.\nAnd despite an upbeat day, Citi head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert warned that tech stocks' rise is slowing and that investors should take a barbell strategy.\n\u201cWhat we're focused on from this barbell angle is we want to be holders of those, but when you look at the rate of increase in this and forward-year earnings expectations, it's been a stair-step function for over a year now,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance Thursday. \u201cIt's beginning to decelerate.\u201d\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

Nvidia shares ended the day down 2.2% to $121 and fell further early Monday. Meanwhile, Chinese AI chipmaker Cambricon Technologies (688256.SS) surged 20% in Monday trading.\nNvidia did not immediately respond to questions from Yahoo Finance.\nMeanwhile, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) dropped 1.2% early Monday. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell modestly, down 0.6% to about $163. Qualcomm (QCOM) shares were flat, while Intel (INTC) fell nearly 2% to around $23. Memory chipmaker and Nvidia partner Micron (MU) fell 3.4% to about $104.\nThe US enacted tougher export controls on AI chips to China in late 2022 \u2014 and has continued to tighten those rules in an attempt to hinder China\u2019s ability to surge ahead in the so-called AI arms race. Nvidia has felt the impact: Sales to China made up 14% of data center revenue during the company\u2019s fiscal year ended Jan. 28, 2024, compared to 19% the prior year.\nNvidia has responded by attempting to work around those roadblocks by creating specific versions of its chips for China, which comply with the stricter controls.\nIts recently launched \u201cH20\u201d Hopper chips for China are expected to generate $12 billion in revenue for the company this year. Nvidia is also set to launch a version of its latest Blackwell chip, called \u201cB20,\u201d for China. A release date has not been set. In the meantime, the black market for Nvidia chips has taken off.\nNvidia sales in China have recovered in recent quarters. Revenue from sales in China totaled about $3.7 billion in the most recent quarter ended July 28, up 33.8% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg estimates. Nvidia shares are up 144% since the start of the year.\n\"If the US more strongly enforces the limits on sales to China, and China more strictly enforces the limits on its own companies, it would have a very detrimental impact on Nvidia,\" D.A. Davidson senior analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance Monday.\nAnalysts remain bullish on Nvidia despite trade tensions and historic volatility in the semiconductor sector. About 90% of Wall Street analysts recommend buying the stock and see shares rising to $147.61 over the next year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\"Unless the economy craters or we go to war with somebody, Nvidia is strong for 12 months, at least,\" said Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights & Strategy.\nDaniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, told Yahoo Finance that there is \u201cstrong optimism right now from the top leaders\u201d in the semiconductor sector.

Investors have had to tweak their portfolios as global central banks tweak their monetary policies in response to slowing inflationary pressure.\nUncertainty over the upcoming US election is another headwind that is fuelling volatility in the markets. Geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, have also weighed significantly, forcing some investors to resort to defensive investment plays.\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy According To Warren Buffett and 10 Best Debt-Free Penny Stocks to Buy Now.\nNevertheless, the array of disappointing economic data led by weakness in the labor market has raised serious doubts about whether the US economy is overheating amid the high interest rates. With the economy creating partly 142,000 jobs and the unemployment rate at 4.25% in August, serious doubts were cast about the resilience of the US economy.\nInvestors need help understanding the state of the US economy, which had decelerated from the rapid expansion it experienced right after the pandemic when companies rushed to reopen and recruit new employees.\nReducing inflation has provided some relief for families struggling with rising costs. However, the job market has also slowed down, with fewer people being hired, wages increasing at a slower pace, and the duration of unemployment increasing as it becomes harder to secure employment.\nSource: pexels\nA survey carried out by CNBC indicates that the probability of the US economy experiencing a soft landing stands at 53% as the US Federal Reserve starts its interest rate cut cycle. According to Michael Englund of Action Economics, the US economy is growing much faster than expected, even as it stares at economic risks on the horizon.\nHowever, there is also a probability that the economy will plunge into recession at 36%, owing to the negative effects of the high interest rates. According to Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG US, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Power's legacy highly depends on him engineering a soft landing after keeping interest rates high for too long.\nAnalysts and economists share mixed opinions on whether the economy needs 25 or 50 basis points to start with to cure the effects of the high interest rate environment. The argument for beginning with a smaller cut is based on the assumption that the economy is fundamentally sound, as current and former FED officials argue.\nThey argue that starting with a 50-basis-point reduction could signal a deeper concern over the economy. It could prompt investors to expect quicker rate reductions, which could spark market booms that complicate efforts to combat inflation.\nOn the other hand, a bigger reduction might cause investors to believe wrongly that the Fed intends to lower rates by the same amount at its meetings in November and December. This could create an expectation that the Fed would move swiftly towards a neutral interest rate target, which is meant to neither stimulate nor decelerate economic growth, according to James Bullard, who served as the president of the St. Louis Fed from 2008 to 2023.\nAmid the monetary policy uncertainty and economic growth slowdown concerns, the US equity market has remained resilient and supported by solid financial results. The S&P 500 rallying by double percentage points affirms growing investor sentiment.\nThe artificial intelligence frenzy has been one of the main catalysts driving sentiments in the equity markets. Some stocks with exposure to AI have rallied by more than 50%. On the other hand, the FED cutting interest rates is expected to provide the much-needed fuel to sustain the upward momentum in the equity markets.\nThe best forever stocks to buy now are companies depicting solid revenue and earnings growth with low debt levels poised to generate long-term shareholder value. Additionally, they boast a competitive edge in their respective industries by investing billions of dollars in research and development.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Justice has sent a subpoena to Nvidia as it deepens its probe into the AI heavyweight's antitrust practices, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the investigation.\nThe antitrust watchdog had previously delivered questionnaires, and has now sent legally binding requests to Nvidia, the report said, adding that other companies had also received subpoenas.\nOfficials are concerned that the chipmaker is making it harder to switch to other suppliers and penalizes buyers that do not exclusively use its artificial intelligence chips, the report said.\n\"Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, who can choose whatever solution is best for them,\" a spokesperson for the company said.\nLast month, the Information reported the Department of Justice had launched an investigation into the company after complaints from competitors that it had abused its market dominance.\nThe subpoena comes at a delicate time for AI-related companies as investors recalibrate expectations around the technology amid worries about slow payoffs from hefty investments in it.\nThe company said last week it has received requests for information from regulators in the U.S. and South Korea, regarding its investments, partnerships and agreements with other companies. It has also received inquiries from the EU, UK and China.\nNvidia's quarterly forecast, which fell short of investors' expectations last week, has also softened the optimism around AI.\nThe company's shares fell 1.5% in extended trading on Tuesday after losing 9.5% in the regular session, slashing Nvidia's market capitalization by $279 billion, a record one-day loss for any company.\nThe shares, however, are still up 141% so far this year, thanks to a dizzying rally sparked by AI expectations.\nThe DoJ declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\n(Reporting by Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Jody Godoy and Max Cherney; Editing by Tasim Zahid and Shinjini Ganguli)\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock (NVDA) Is Still a Long-Term Winner, No Matter the Noise",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) prodigy Nvidia (NVDA), the world\u2019s third-highest-valued stock, experienced a material decline in market capitalization following its Q2 earnings in late August. However, NVDA stock has shown some vigor again, rising 5% in the last week. After temporarily surpassing the $3 trillion milestone earlier this year, investors are wondering what the future will hold. \u00a0My thesis remains unchanged \u2014 I\u2019m bullish on NVDA shares as an investment due to its clear AI supremacy and exponential growth potential.\nIt is well known that NVDA is positioned for a long runway of growth with top-notch clients like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) bulking up on their AI efforts. However, beyond these leading customers, Nvidia\u2019s AI penetration is still rising across all industries, increasing my optimism for NVDA stock. Enterprises across industries and geographies are eager to incorporate AI benefits into their operations. Likewise, NVDA continues to enter into collaborations with top businesses.\nThere\u2019s a reason enterprises are flocking to NVDA for their AI ambitions. Beyond being the leader in AI GPU processors, NVDA provides a complete end-to-end AI infrastructure that supercharges productivity. That\u2019s something that few, if any, of its global AI peers can deliver.\nAnother reason for my optimism about NVDA is CEO Jensen Huang\u2018s relentless focus. He is committed to transforming NVDA into a fully AI-driven data center powerhouse that covers all aspects of hardware and software under the NVDA brand.\nThis strategy is a key reason why NVDA can maintain premium pricing for its products, contributing to steady growth in its profit margins. However, critics argue that NVDA\u2019s exceptional revenue and margin growth may not be sustainable. Some members of the investment community are worried about a slowdown in revenue growth over the coming years.\nFor context, NVDA reported an extraordinary 217% increase in its data center revenues for fiscal 2024. While that growth is expected to moderate to around 130% in 2025, this remains an impressive triple-digit figure, especially considering the strong FY2024 baseline for comparison. Although lower than today\u2019s pace, these are still remarkable growth projections for the future. I view bullish analyst estimates as a reason to remain confident in this AI leader, particularly as the disruptive potential of generative AI is only beginning to unfold.\nDemand for NVDA\u2019s chips is robust and will boost future revenues in the coming quarters. Therefore, despite some investor concerns, I expect NVDA will continue to maintain its clear AI dominance with an unbeatable competitive moat and best-in-class AI products and services.\nNvidia posted yet another stellar Q2 result on August 28, 2024, driven by accelerated computing and the continued momentum of generative AI.\u00a0Adjusted earnings of $0.68 per share\u00a0handily beat the consensus analyst estimate of $0.65 per share. The figure came in much higher (+152%) than the Fiscal Q2-2023 figure of $0.27 per share.\nThe company posted a 122% year-over-year revenue growth, delivering $30.04 billion for the three months ending July 31 and surpassing analysts\u2019 projections. Importantly, Data Center revenues, the company\u2019s crown-jewel division, grew 154% year-over-year to $26.3 billion. Additionally NVDA\u2019s adjusted gross margin expanded 5 percentage points to 75.1% from 70.1% a year ago. Many investors were apparently hoping for even bigger numbers, and therefore the stock dropped slightly following the Q2 report. Shares then continued a downtrend until they bottomed out on September 6, just above the $100 level.\nNvidia\u2019s guidance for the 3rd quarter appeared less promising to investors, with\u00a0revenues\u00a0expected to reach about $32.5 billion. Guidance came in below expectations. Adjusted gross margins are forecast to level off at about 75%, versus 75.15% delivered in Q2.\nInsider selling at Nvidia added downward pressure on NVDA shares in recent months. CEO Jensen Huang sold NVDA shares across multiple transactions from June to September, but it\u2019s important to know that those sales were part of a predetermined trading plan adopted in March. This plan allowed Huang to sell up to six million NVDA shares by the end of Q1 2025.\nNotably, Huang has completed sales of more than $700 million worth of NVDA stock. Despite the significance of these sales, he remains the largest individual shareholder of the company. At last report, Huang held 786 million shares through various trusts and partnerships, and 75.3 million shares directly, according to company filings. Combined, Huang controls a ~3.5% stake in the company, with an approximate total of 859 million shares.\nInvestors may have been hesitant to buy NVDA stock at current levels, pointing to the stock\u2019s extraordinary run as well as due to concerns about the company\u2019s and slowing growth.\nOn the contrary, however, my contention is that NVDA stock is not as expensive as it may seem. Currently, it\u2019s trading at a forward P/E ratio of about 43x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is actually cheaper than some valuation multiples of its peers. For instance, NVDA\u2019s closest competitor and U.S.-based semiconductor company, Advanced Micro Devices, carries a 46.8x forward P/E. Interestingly, NVDA\u2019s current valuation still reflects a 10% discount to its five-year average forward P/E of 47.3x.\nGiven NVDA\u2019s consistent outperformance and strong growth potential, the current valuation appears reasonable and justified. Any future dip in the stock price could represent a solid buying opportunity, in my opinion, especially considering Nvidia\u2019s immense potential in the rapidly expanding AI market.\nWith 39 Buys and three Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus TipRanks rating is a Strong Buy. The\u00a0average Nvidia stock target price of $152.44\u00a0implies potential upside of about 26% for the next year.\nDespite recent weakness, NVDA shares have nearly tripled over the past year compared to a rise of about 37% for the Nasdaq 100. The post-earnings sell-off for NVDA stock, in my view, was largely driven by profit-taking. After bottoming near $100, the stock appears to be in recovery mode now.\nIn the near term, I believe ongoing economic and political uncertainties may keep the stock range-bound. However, I view any dips as buying opportunities. I see NVDA as a strong long-term investment given the significant continued potential of AI.\nRead full\u00a0Disclosure\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) fell as much as 2.8% in premarket trading Monday as investors continued to absorb news that Chinese regulators are reportedly discouraging local companies from buying Nvidia\u2019s artificial intelligence chips.\nThe stock pared losses after the bell, down about 1.4% to around $120.\nBloomberg reported Friday afternoon that Beijing is urging Chinese companies to buy from chipmakers within its own borders \u2014 rather than Nvidia\u2019s popular GPUs \u2014 amid heightened trade tensions with the US. Nvidia shares ended the day down 2.2% to $121 and fell further early Monday. Meanwhile, Chinese AI chipmaker Cambricon Technologies (688256.SS) surged 20% in Monday trading.\nNvidia did not immediately respond to questions from Yahoo Finance.\nMeanwhile, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) dropped 1.2% early Monday. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell modestly, down 0.6% to about $163. Qualcomm (QCOM) shares were flat, while Intel (INTC) fell nearly 2% to around $23. Memory chipmaker and Nvidia partner Micron (MU) fell 3.4% to about $104.\nThe US enacted tougher export controls on AI chips to China in late 2022 \u2014 and has continued to tighten those rules in an attempt to hinder China\u2019s ability to surge ahead in the so-called AI arms race. Nvidia has felt the impact: Sales to China made up 14% of data center revenue during the company\u2019s fiscal year ended Jan. 28, 2024, compared to 19% the prior year.\nNvidia has responded by attempting to work around those roadblocks by creating specific versions of its chips for China, which comply with the stricter controls.\nIts recently launched \u201cH20\u201d Hopper chips for China are expected to generate $12 billion in revenue for the company this year. Nvidia is also set to launch a version of its latest Blackwell chip, called \u201cB20,\u201d for China. A release date has not been set. In the meantime, the black market for Nvidia chips has taken off.\nNvidia sales in China have recovered in recent quarters. Revenue from sales in China totaled about $3.7 billion in the most recent quarter ended July 28, up 33.8% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg estimates. Nvidia shares are up 144% since the start of the year.\n\"If the US more strongly enforces the limits on sales to China, and China more strictly enforces the limits on its own companies, it would have a very detrimental impact on Nvidia,\" D.A. Davidson senior analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance Monday.\nAnalysts remain bullish on Nvidia despite trade tensions and historic volatility in the semiconductor sector. About 90% of Wall Street analysts recommend buying the stock and see shares rising to $147.61 over the next year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\"Unless the economy craters or we go to war with somebody, Nvidia is strong for 12 months, at least,\" said Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights & Strategy.\nDaniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, told Yahoo Finance that there is \u201cstrong optimism right now from the top leaders\u201d in the semiconductor sector. He noted that Nvidia stock has been more volatile since its 10-for-1 stock split in June.\nThis story has been updated.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Title": "Will Nvidia Stock Drop as Much as Supermicro? 3 Points to Consider.",
        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has pulled back since the summer as it struggled to meet ever-increasing investor expectations. However, its fall did not compare to that of one of its key partners, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), which has faced a string of confidence-rattling events.\nSupermicro delayed the filing of its latest 10-K on Aug. 28, a day after short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report alleged accounting irregularities at the company. As a short-seller, Hindenburg benefits when the stock falls. Then, on Sept. 26, The Wall Street Journal reported that unnamed sources indicated the Department of Justice had launched a probe into Supermicro.\nStill, Supermicro stock was having a rocky time before the recent news. It's down about 60% over the past six months as I write this.\nNvidia has had two declines in the last 10 years that exceeded 50% and investors might be worried that a similar pullback is possible again. But that looks increasingly unlikely. Three reasons explain why.\nUltimately, the most crucial factor driving Nvidia stock is its lead in the AI chip market. Although companies like AMD and Qualcomm have begun to develop competing products, Nvidia is far ahead, and new releases will likely ensure it stays on top.\nIn contrast, Supermicro is not the only server company -- many companies can build servers with Nvidia AI chips. Supermicro has developed a niche by focusing on environmentally friendly and energy-saving servers. Nonetheless, it has to compete against companies such as Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, giving it no obvious path to industry leadership.\nAs the market leader, Nvidia has gotten a substantial boost in its valuation. In this case, valuation goes far beyond the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). It has grown its profits so rapidly that its earnings multiple is 58. That is higher than Supermicro's 20 P/E, but you could argue Nvidia is cheap considering its triple-digit profit growth.\nHowever, where Nvidia's premium really stands out in its price-to-sales ratio (P/S). The market values Nvidia at about 32 times its revenue, far above Supermicro's sales multiple of 1.6.\nThat P/S ratio could leave Nvidia vulnerable to a massive downturn in its stock price if its growth slows down. Still, Nvidia might be able to avoid such a decline if it can continue to maintain triple-digit or high double-digit net income growth for the foreseeable future.\nInvestors also need to keep in mind the history of both companies and their divergent growth paths. Interestingly, both companies came into being in the same year, 1993. And both spent decades not being seen as mainstream forces in the tech industry.\nSupermicro develops IT hardware that it sells in over 100 countries, and despite the extent of its business, it gained little name recognition outside its industry for years.\nNvidia was better known because of its long history of making popular graphics processing units (GPUs). These products were not the most crucial part of a computer and server until a few years ago. However, once data centers made GPUs a more crucial part of the IT infrastructure, the past successes positioned it to emerge as an industry leader.\nIn contrast, Supermicro did not achieve significant recognition until the pandemic, when demand for its cloud servers increased. When it finally became better known, the growth and recognition fostered a high level of volatility in the stock. And the recent short-seller moves as well as rumors of DOJ interest in the stock have created more volatility. And that could continue, while Nvidia faces no such pressure.\nAlthough anything can happen with Nvidia stock in the near term, investors should probably not have to worry about a drop that compares to the one that Supermicro has faced in 2024.\nUnlike Supermicro, Nvidia is a clear technical leader in the AI industry. Moreover, it should maintain a high valuation benefiting from a technical lead and good management. In contrast, Supermicro faces struggles as it gains more name recognition and deals with controversy.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Intel Corp. INTC and Arm Holdings plc ARM.\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nWall Street darling NVIDIA Corp. recently reported its fiscal second-quarter results, following which its shares dipped. Does this mean that NVIDIA has lost its sheen to arch-rivals Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and Intel Corp. in the semiconductor space? Or, does it still have the potential to increase shareholders' wealth soon? Let's examine \u2013\nNVIDIA recently posted blowout second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues and net income that easily surpassed analysts' estimates. For the quarter ending on July 28, 2024, earnings per share for the chipmaker came in at $0.68, up 11% from the prior quarter and up 152% year over year.\nTotal reported revenues were $30 billion, up 15% from the previous quarter and 122% from a year ago. Revenues of each segment, such as data center, gaming, professional visualization, and robotics were up from the previous quarter and year.\nStrong demand for existing Hopper chips and shipping of next-generation Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) chips to be launched later this year boosted NVIDIA's quarterly results.\nHowever, despite such promising quarterly results, NVIDIA's shares dipped 6.4% in Thursday's trading and were 2.1% lower on Wednesday. This is because the performance expectations were much higher as the NVIDIA stock is currently the S&P 500's best performer this year.\nThe share price drop at the moment is just a blip for NVIDIA. This is because if we look at the broader picture, with the Federal Reserve all set to trim interest rates in the September policy meeting, NVIDIA's capital expenditure outlays on AI-related infrastructure are expected to increase.\nAI is a growing field, with the industry expected to expand from $214.6 billion in the current year to $1,339.1 billion by 2030, per MarketsandMarkets.\nWhile the Blackwell AI chip launch will give NVIDIA a competitive edge over its peers, its gaming graphic processing units (GPU) product line, GeForce, is expected to help NVIDIA penetrate the growing gaming market. NVIDIA's initiative to enter the industrial metaverse space with the help of Siemens is also a tailwind for the company.\nLike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices also makes semiconductors and is trying to enter the gaming space. However, NVIDIA is way ahead of Advanced Micro Devices, whose latest quarterly revenues were minuscule compared to that of NVIDIA. In the recently reported quarter, Advanced Micro Devices' total revenues increased just 9% from a year ago.\nAdvanced Micro Devices is investing heavily in AI, but unlike NVIDIA, they are late to the party. Any AI investment takes a long period to generate returns on the invested capital. Moreover, Advanced Micro Devices hasn't poured money into the necessary AI infrastructure, which can be an issue for the company in the long run.\nAnyhow, Advanced Micro Devices is losing the competition with NVIDIA. Per data from Jon Peddie Research, Advanced Micro Devices' market shares in GPUs have fallen from 35% to 12% over the past decade, while NVIDIA's shares have risen from 65% to 88%.\nWhile NVIDIA is in a league of its own, Intel is struggling to compete with Advanced Micro Devices, which has seen some progress in the production of high-performance processing machinery.\nIntel is in dire straits after failing to progress in the foundry business. Intel failed to make the most of the ever-expanding AI applications industry, where most of its peers are doing reasonably well.\nIntel's server and networking segment is also being disrupted by Arm Holdings plc. Many of ARM's designs in the micro server segment have been accepted by Intel's competitors. Intel's shares never fully recovered from the dot-com bubble burst and currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.\nNVIDIA has generated profits more proficiently than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. This is because the NVIDIA stock has a return on equity (ROE) of 124.6%, while Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have an ROE of 6% and 1.8%, respectively. As a thumb rule, any reading above 20% is considered very good.\nNVIDIA's net profit margin is 55%, way more than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel's 5.8% and 1.8%, respectively. Any reading above the threshold of 20% signifies the company has been able to keep operation costs under control and generate profit from sales. As a result, the $2.71 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA's earnings per share is up 74.8% year over year.\nFrom a technical perspective, the NVIDIA stock has been constantly trading above its 200-day moving average (DMA) so far this year, indicating a long-term uptrend.\nOn the other hand, the prices of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have fallen below the 200 DMA this year, a tell-tale sign of a persistent downtrend.\nWith NVIDIA's shares exhibiting a bullish trend and the stock faring much better than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel in the AI space and beyond, notable brokers have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 13.5% from the stock's last closing price of $125.61. The analysts' highest price target is at $200.\nHence, despite the recent hiccups, investors should hang on to the NVIDIA stock more than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, as AI is here to stay (read more: 2 AI Stocks That Can Be the Next NVIDIA).\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

NVIDIA's initiative to enter the industrial metaverse space with the help of Siemens is also a tailwind for the company.\nLike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices also makes semiconductors and is trying to enter the gaming space. However, NVIDIA is way ahead of Advanced Micro Devices, whose latest quarterly revenues were minuscule compared to that of NVIDIA. In the recently reported quarter, Advanced Micro Devices' total revenues increased just 9% from a year ago.\nAdvanced Micro Devices is investing heavily in AI, but unlike NVIDIA, they are late to the party. Any AI investment takes a long period to generate returns on the invested capital. Moreover, Advanced Micro Devices hasn't poured money into the necessary AI infrastructure, which can be an issue for the company in the long run.\nAnyhow, Advanced Micro Devices is losing the competition with NVIDIA. Per data from Jon Peddie Research, Advanced Micro Devices' market shares in GPUs have fallen from 35% to 12% over the past decade, while NVIDIA's shares have risen from 65% to 88%.\nWhile NVIDIA is in a league of its own, Intel is struggling to compete with Advanced Micro Devices, which has seen some progress in the production of high-performance processing machinery.\nIntel is in dire straits after failing to progress in the foundry business. Intel failed to make the most of the ever-expanding AI applications industry, where most of its peers are doing reasonably well.\nIntel's server and networking segment is also being disrupted by Arm Holdings plc. Many of ARM's designs in the micro server segment have been accepted by Intel's competitors. Intel's shares never fully recovered from the dot-com bubble burst and currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.\nNVIDIA has generated profits more proficiently than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. This is because the NVIDIA stock has a return on equity (ROE) of 124.6%, while Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have an ROE of 6% and 1.8%, respectively. As a thumb rule, any reading above 20% is considered very good.\nNVIDIA's net profit margin is 55%, way more than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel's 5.8% and 1.8%, respectively. Any reading above the threshold of 20% signifies the company has been able to keep operation costs under control and generate profit from sales. As a result, the $2.71 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA's earnings per share is up 74.8% year over year.\nFrom a technical perspective, the NVIDIA stock has been constantly trading above its 200-day moving average (DMA) so far this year, indicating a long-term uptrend.\nOn the other hand, the prices of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have fallen below the 200 DMA this year, a tell-tale sign of a persistent downtrend.\nWith NVIDIA's shares exhibiting a bullish trend and the stock faring much better than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel in the AI space and beyond, notable brokers have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 13.5% from the stock's last closing price of $125.61. The analysts' highest price target is at $200.\nHence, despite the recent hiccups, investors should hang on to the NVIDIA stock more than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, as AI is here to stay (read more: 2 AI Stocks That Can Be the Next NVIDIA).\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?",
        "Author": "  Tirthankar Chakraborty ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA crushed bubble fears this year and its shares surged more than 100%. However, NVIDIA\u2019s stock price recently faced bouts of volatility after tech behemoths trimmed spending on artificial intelligence (AI) and the company\u2019s latest quarterly results failed to meet high expectations.\nBut it\u2019s also true that NVIDIA\u2019s newest stock buyback plan is expected to please income-oriented investors. So, is this the right time to buy the NVIDIA stock? Let\u2019s have a look \u2013\nNVIDIA hasn\u2019t tampered with its quarterly dividends, but it recently authorized a fresh $50 billion share repurchase. However, stock buybacks aren\u2019t new for NVIDIA. The company approved a $25 billion share repurchase in August 2023 and bought back stocks worth around $15.4 billion in the first half of its fiscal 2025.\nNVIDIA\u2019s board of directors can afford to repurchase shares as the company has generated significant cash flows. NVIDIA\u2019s new stock buyback plan is currently the third largest on the S&P 500. Apple Inc. AAPL has repurchased shares worth around $91 billion over the past year, while Alphabet Inc. GOOGL has repurchased some $63 billion in shares, per FactSet.\nShare repurchases, in general, are an indication of a healthy corporate organization. This is because share repurchases lead to a decrease in the number of outstanding shares and an increase in the value of the remaining shares, which is a blessing for shareholders.\nNVIDIA\u2019s new $50 billion stock buyback and the remaining $7.5 billion share repurchase authorization may be less than 2% of the company\u2019s market capitalization. However, this shows that management is optimistic about NVIDIA\u2019s future business prospects.\nDo share prices go up after a stock buyback? The reduction in the number of outstanding shares often leads to an uptick in share prices. So, it\u2019s expected that NVIDIA\u2019s shares should increase in the long run.\nIt\u2019s prudent for investors to ignore NVIDIA\u2019s $279 billion market capitalization rout on Tuesday since its shares are not down on isolation. The broader tech sector fell due to discouraging economic data. In reality, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average (DMA) year to date, signifying a long-term uptrend.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBeing the worldwide leader in graphic processing units (GPUs) bodes well for NVIDIA. The company\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, recently said that $1 trillion worth of data centers would migrate from central processing units (CPUs) to GPUs.\nNotably, the global GPU market size is projected to jump from $75.77 billion in 2024 to $1,414.39 billion by 2034 at a CAGR of 13.8%, according to Precedence Research.\nGPU Market Size 2023 to 2034 (USD Billion)\nImage Source: Precedence Research\nNVIDIA\u2019s strong positioning in the AI field should help its shares scale upward. MarketsandMarkets stated that the AI industry is estimated to expand from $214.6 billion in the current year to $1,339.1 billion by 2030.\nLaunch of the cutting-edge Blackwell AI chips later this year would eventually squash any skepticism about NVIDIA. This is because Blackwell is more than just a GPU, its infrastructure platform can offer more AI throughput than the current Hopper platform.\nNVIDIA\u2019s initiatives to enter the ever-growing gaming and industrial metaverse space are also a tailwind for the company. Hence, the $2.76 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s earnings per share is up 73.6% from a year ago (read more: The Best Chip Stock Post NVIDIA Earnings: NVDA, AMD, or INTC?).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFundamentally, NVIDIA has been able to generate profits more proficiently. After all, NVIDIA stock\u2019s return on equity (ROE) is nearly 120%, while the Semiconductor-General industry\u2019s is 73.2%. An ROE above 100% shows that the company\u2019s net income is greater than its equity or that the company\u2019s performance is very strong.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nDespite the positives, buying NVIDIA\u2019s shares may burn a hole in your wallet. The voracious demand for AI models and supremacy in the GPU market has made the NVIDIA stock pricey.\nThis is because, per the price/earnings ratio, NVIDIA stock currently trades at 43.2X forward earnings. However, NVIDIA\u2019s rivals or the peer group\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 18.2X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThus, investors should wait for the right entry point and buy on the dip. Those who have invested in NVIDIA should hang on to it since the stock is for the future, as AI is the next big thing in the technology space (read more: 2 AI Stocks That Can Be the Next NVIDIA).\nNVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Title": "Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): \u201cDoes anyone care about artificial intelligence anymore?\u201d",
        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Jim Cramer Thinks These 10 Stocks Deserve Your Attention. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer thinks deserve attention.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised investors to hold off on selling stocks, anticipating a rebound once the market\u2019s downturn ended. This strategy proved effective as the average investor saw gains, with the Dow rising by 484 points or 1.16%, and the NASDAQ also climbing by 1.16%. This performance suggests that selling during Friday\u2019s decline was not the best move.\n\u201cLast week, I advised you to hold off on selling everything and just wait, as I believed that once the pain ended, we would see a rebound. The average investor saw gains, with the Dow up 484 points, or 1.16%, and the NASDAQ also climbing 1.16%. While it might not be a full recovery, it shows that selling into Friday\u2019s downturn wasn\u2019t the best strategy.\u201d\nThe previous week was challenging for economically sensitive stocks and tech stocks, despite the August employment report showing modest growth and a downward revision for July. The recent report seemed favorable for those hoping for Federal Reserve rate cuts, as it presented a balanced scenario of neither too strong nor too weak. Nonetheless, Wall Street reacted negatively, with investors moving away from cyclical stocks in favor of recession-proof sectors like consumer goods and pharmaceuticals. Industrials and semiconductors were particularly affected.\nJim Cramer observed that on Monday, recession-proof stocks such as pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform strongly. However, this trend is concerning as these stocks have surged significantly and might be due for a correction.\n\u201cRecession-proof stocks like pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform well, which is dangerous as these stocks have seen parabolic gains and could be due for a correction.\u201d\nAccording to Cramer, historically, when the Federal Reserve is about to cut rates, it\u2019s a signal to shift investment strategies. With the Fed moving towards easing and a rate cut expected next week, Cramer suggests it\u2019s time to reconsider holding recession-proof stocks. Instead, investors should look at more cyclical companies that could benefit from economic stimulation. While investing in cyclical stocks during a downturn can be challenging, anticipating a positive impact from the Fed\u2019s rate cuts could make these stocks attractive.\n\u201cHistorically, when the Fed is about to start cutting rates, we know that it\u2019s time to shift focus. With the Fed leaning towards easing and an expected rate cut next week, it\u2019s time to consider moving away from recession-proof stocks and investing in more cyclical companies. While it\u2019s challenging to buy cyclical stocks during a slowdown, anticipating that the Fed will boost the economy can make them strong investment opportunities. It\u2019s important to maintain diversification but be ready to adjust as needed.\u201d\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nJim Cramer questioned whether artificial intelligence is still a hot topic, given recent trading patterns. He pointed out that stocks associated with AI, including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a key player in the AI space and a name in his investment club\u2014have dropped nearly 14% over the past five sessions. This decline raises doubts about current investor interest in AI-related investments.\n\u201cDoes anyone care about artificial intelligence anymore? Seems fair to ask considering the recent trading in stocks lumped into the AI trade, including key enabler and fellow Club name Nvidia, which is down almost 14% in the past five sessions.\u201d\nA positive outlook on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is supported by its impressive financial performance and leadership in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers. In Q2 FY2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s revenue surged 122% year-over-year to $30 billion, with net income increasing 168% to $16.6 billion. This growth was driven mainly by a 154% rise in data center revenue, reaching $26.3 billion, due to high demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s advanced Hopper GPUs used in AI applications.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s leadership in AI is further highlighted by its upcoming Blackwell architecture, expected to boost revenue even more. The gaming segment also performed well, with a 16% revenue increase to $2.9 billion, thanks to the versatility of its RTX GPUs, which are used for both gaming and AI tasks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s commitment to returning value to shareholders is clear with its $50 billion share repurchase program, showing strong confidence in future growth.\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor\u00a0letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving.\nOverall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of Jim Cramer Thinks These 10 Stocks Deserve Your Attention. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "4 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist After Its Latest Pullback",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights ",
        "Text": "I was right about Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). And I was wrong, too.\nEarlier this week, I predicted the stock would soar after its fiscal 2025 second-quarter update on Aug. 28 for three key reasons: blowout numbers, stellar guidance, and clarity on its Blackwell platform launch. Nvidia indeed reported blowout Q2 numbers. It provided stellar guidance. The company also gave more information about when it would begin shipping Blackwell.\nHowever, Nvidia's shares didn't soar despite all of this good news. Instead, the stock tumbled 6% lower the day after its Q2 update.\nShould investors buy Nvidia stock hand over fist after its latest pullback? Here are four reasons why the answer could be a resounding \"yes.\"\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said in the company's Q2 earnings call that the Blackwell platform will ramp up production beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. She added that Nvidia expects Blackwell will generate \"several billion dollars\" of revenue in Q4. Kress mentioned that demand exceeds supply, a trend that should extend into next year.\nCEO Jensen Huang clarified that Nvidia will begin shipping Blackwell in Q4. He touted Blackwell's capabilities and maintained that it's \"going to be a complete game-changer for the industry.\" Huang emphasized that Blackwell isn't just a graphics processing unit (GPU); it's \"an AI infrastructure platform\" that offers between 3 times and 5 times more AI throughput than Nvidia's Hopper platform.\nSome investors might have been disappointed that Nvidia missed its \"whisper\" earnings number in Q2 despite beating the official Wall Street estimates. However, I suspect the release of Blackwell will soon wipe away those misgivings.\nIt's important to keep in mind why Blackwell and forthcoming innovations are so critical to Nvidia's success. A massive migration of data centers from CPUs to GPUs is underway. As Huang said in the Q2 call, \"$1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs.\"\nDon't look at this as an opportunity for Nvidia that's well into the future, though. Huang noted that the company expects its data-center business will grow \"quite significantly next year.\"\nOne reason why data centers need powerful GPUs is that the next generation of generative AI is at hand. According to Huang, \"The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software.\" He noted that Nvidia is already using generative AI coding \"quite extensively.\"\nBut while the use of generative AI in coding, chatbots, and image generation is accelerating, Huang argues that's \"just the tip of the iceberg.\" He mentioned several other areas that generative AI is transforming, including ad targeting, large-scale recommender systems, robotics, and search systems.\nImportantly, training next-generation AI models will require 10 times to 20 times more computing power. This creates a huge growth market for Nvidia, one the company is capitalizing on.\nThere's at least one other reason to buy Nvidia stock after the recent pullback: The company plans to buy its shares hand over fist. Nvidia's board of directors approved a $50 billion stock-buyback authorization. This comes on top of the $7.5 billion remaining on the existing share-repurchase authorization.\nSure, the total amount of authorized-stock buybacks represents less than 2% of Nvidia's market cap. However, the increased authorization underscores that the board believes in the company's future growth prospects. With Nvidia prepared to bet another $50 billion on itself, it could give investors putting up much less money to buy the stock with more confidence in their decision.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $731,449!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying an Index Fund That Could Soar 43%, According to a Wall Street Analyst",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence has been the dominant investing theme for the last two years, and Nvidia has stolen the spotlight. The company reported triple-digit sales growth in the last five quarters, and shares have surged more than sevenfold since January 2023, making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during that period.\nHowever, artificial intelligence is not the only theme investors should explore. The hedge fund managers listed below (all of whom are billionaires) sold Nvidia stock in the second quarter while buying shares of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEMKT: IWM), an index fund that tracks the small-cap Russell 2000.\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors sold 9.2 million shares of Nvidia, slashing his stake by 79%. He also added 125,383 shares of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (exchange-traded fund), increasing his position by 27%.\nDavid Shaw of D.E. Shaw & Co. sold 12.1 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 52%. He also added 638,084 shares of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF, increasing his position by 169%.\nImportantly, Ken Griffin and David Shaw run the best-performing hedge funds as measured by net gains since inception. Neither fund manager closed their position in Nvidia, so we can't assume they have lost confidence in the chipmaker. But we can assume they are bullish about small-cap stocks.\nTom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, shares that optimistic outlook. In January, he told CNBC that the Russell 2000 could end the year above 3,000. That implies 43% upside from its current level of 2,091, which suggests identical gains for shareholders of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF.\nHere's what investors should know.\nThe Russell 2000 index measures the performance of approximately 2,000 small-cap U.S. stocks, representing 5% of domestic equities in terms of total value. The median market capitalization among Russell 2000 companies is roughly $1 billion. By comparison, the S&P 500 is a large-cap index, and the median market capitalization is $33 billion.\nTom Lee is optimistic about small-cap stocks for two reasons. First, small-cap valuations are at their cheapest level in decades relative to large-cap stocks. Second, small-cap companies are more sensitive to interest rates, so they stand to benefit more than large-cap companies when the Federal Reserve starts cutting rates.\nRegarding valuations, J.P. Morgan strategist Michael Cembalest recently wrote, \"Small-cap stocks are at their cheapest levels in the 21st century with potential market and political catalysts in their favor.\" But he also noted that small-cap companies are likelier to have lower margins and negative earnings than large-cap companies.\nWith respect to interest rates, small-cap companies rely more heavily on floating-rate debt, meaning debt with a variable interest rate tied to some benchmark, often the federal funds rate. So, when the Federal Reserve lowers its benchmark rate, floating-rate debt becomes less expensive. \"Small-cap companies tend to take on more floating-rate debt, and so lower rates are very helpful,\" according to Sonu Varghese at Carson Group.\nImportantly, the market expects the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates at its meeting later this month.\nThe iShares Russell 2000 ETF lets investors spread capital across the Russell 2000 index, giving them diversified exposure to roughly 2,000 small-cap companies. The 10 largest holdings in the index fund are listed by weight below:\nVaxcyte: 0.5%\nFTAI Aviation: 0.5%\nInsmed: 0.4%\nSprouts Farmers Market: 0.4%\nEnsign Group: 0.3%\nFabrinet: 0.3%\nFluor: 0.3%\nHalozyme Therapeutics: 0.3%\nMueller Industries: 0.3%\nApplied Industrial Technologies: 0.3%\nThe small-cap Russell 2000 has consistently underperformed the S&P 500 over the last five years, 10 years, and 20 years, and the underperformance was often extreme. For instance, the Russell 2000 returned 105% during the last decade, compounding at 7.4% annually. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 returned 224%, compounding at 12.4% annually.\nThe iShares Russell 2000 ETF has a reasonable expense ratio of 0.19%, meaning the annual fees will total $1.90 for every $1,000 invested in the fund. For comparison, the average expense ratio across U.S. index funds was 0.36% in 2023, according to Morningstar.\nHere's the bottom line: Patient investors should consider buying a small position in the iShares Russell 2000 ETF today. The index fund could soar when the Federal Reserve starts cutting rates and small-cap stocks trade at historically cheap valuations.\nHowever, shareholders should not expect a 43% return by year-end. Additionally, investors who own the iShares Russell 2000 ETF should consider balancing their portfolios with an S&P 500 index fund. The Russell 2000 could conceivably outperform the S&P 500 in the future, but history says that outcome is unlikely to persist over long periods.\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Trust - iShares Russell 2000 ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and iShares Trust - iShares Russell 2000 ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 1 Year?",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's no secret that excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has helped propel technology stocks, and the entire market, to new highs over the last year. It's also no secret that semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has witnessed unparalleled buying activity -- so much so, that it's now the third most valuable company in the world as measured by market cap.\nBut with shares soaring 140% so far in 2024 and 160% over the last 12 months, could Nvidia stock possibly be headed even higher?\nBelow, I'll explore some factors that could support the ideas of Nvidia stock moving both higher or lower over the next year. Let's dig into the full picture and assess what could influence Nvidia's price action. I'll make my final case for where I see Nvidia stock landing one year from now.\nOver the last couple of years, one of the biggest catalysts for semiconductor companies is demand for graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are an integral component for training large language models (LLMs) and myriad machine learning applications.\nAs it stands today, Nvidia is widely perceived as developing the best GPUs on the market. Its hardware roster featuring H100 and A100 chips is used by some of the largest companies in the world. Furthermore, Nvidia's next-generation GPUs, the Blackwell series, are finally set to hit the market following a brief setback due to a design flaw.\nDuring Nvidia's second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call, CFO Colette Kress said, \"Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year.\"\nKress said that Blackwell should generate \"several billion dollars\" of revenue during the fourth quarter. Considering the robust demand levels for Blackwell, I think it's reasonable to think that the bulk of these revenue tailwinds will trickle into fiscal 2026 (calendar year 2025).\nAs a result, I would not be surprised at all to see Nvidia stock experience some revived buying activity throughout the latter half of 2024 and into early months of 2025.\nEven if Nvidia shares experience a nice pop, I think concerns around competition could dent any euphoria surrounding the stock.\nWhile Nvidia faces direct competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices, the company is also looking at rising opposition from other megacap tech companies. Some examples include:\nAmazon: While Amazon is mostly known for its e-commerce marketplace, the company is a massive force in the world of cloud computing thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Over the last year, Amazon has invested billions into AI-related initiatives. Two big areas where Amazon has doubled down on its AI vision are an $11 billion data center project in Indiana as well as developing its own training and inferencing chips.\nMeta Platforms: Meta is a known customer of Nvidia. Per comments made by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, a good portion of Meta's capital expenditure (capex) budget has been geared toward buying H100 GPUs. However, Meta has also been designing its own chip, dubbed the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA). I see this as a move to migrate away from Nvidia over time, and keep as much of Meta's technology stack internalized as possible.\nTesla: Another known \"Magnificent Seven\" customer of Nvidia is Tesla. The company's CEO, Elon Musk, has referenced Nvidia's H100 GPUs as a critical piece of infrastructure in training the company's autonomous driving software. However, during Tesla's second-quarter earnings call, Musk stated that the company might have to compete with Nvidia in the future because \"demand for Nvidia hardware is so high that it's often difficult to get the GPUs.\"\nThere are a couple of important ideas to unpack here. First, as more chips enter the competitive landscape, it's natural to think that Nvidia's growth could continue slowing. Moreover, a potentially bigger issue is that many companies seeking to disrupt Nvidia's dominance are its own customers.\nTo me, GPUs will eventually be seen as commoditized pieces of hardware. This will essentially force Nvidia to compete on price, and since many of its largest sources of growth are looking to move away from a reliance on its hardware, the company's sales and profits could start witnessing a dramatic deceleration.\nThis could lead to a normalization of Nvidia's stock price as its growth prospects become less attractive.\nIn addition to competition, I see a couple of other things that could impact Nvidia's stock price. As I recently expressed, I have some major questions over the company's $50 billion share buyback. I do not see this as an efficient use of capital allocation, and I think it could permeate into a broader narrative that negatively impacts the stock.\nFurthermore, as murmurs continue about a possible investigation from the Department of Justice (DOJ) over antitrust concerns, it's very possible that some investors will dump Nvidia stock purely out of emotional fear.\nI will admit that the buyback and the possibility of government intervention are longer-term issues surrounding Nvidia, but I think the ideas of both could impact the stock in the near term.\nAt the end of the day, I think Nvidia stock will experience a period of fleeting buying activity influenced by newfound growth inspired from Blackwell. However, I see these gains as short-lived as competition rises and question marks remain over the company's growth tactics. For this reason, I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia stock is relatively flat overall one year from now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "When digging through financial statements, it's important to look at the trends for metrics rather than just a single quarter of results. This can lead to a better picture of a company's performance, and I've pinpointed one for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) that investors should watch.\nThe trend of this metric is concerning and could cause weakness in the stock.\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become an important piece of computing hardware. Their ability to process multiple calculations in parallel separates them from more conventional computing methods. This also makes them perfect for processes that require intense calculations, like training artificial intelligence (AI) models or running an engineering simulation.\nAI has been the primary driver for Nvidia's surge in GPU demand. With major players in AI loading up on its GPUs, the company has been able to charge practically whatever it wants, since its GPUs are seen as second to none.\nThis has shown up in its gross profit margin, a figure that conveys how much money is left after the cost of manufacturing the product is accounted for.\nHistorically, Nvidia's gross profit margin hovered in the high 50% to low 60% range. But thanks to this new wave in demand and the company's market position, it has spiked to around 75%.\nBut the second quarter saw a slight decline in gross margin from the first quarter, falling to 75.1% from 78.4%. This fall is expected to continue in the third quarter, with management's projections guiding for 74.4% gross margins.\nThis isn't a huge decline, but the trend is noteworthy. Usually, when a company's gross margins fall, it means it has to decrease prices to drive more demand. Obviously, Nvidia doesn't need any more demand. But what the decline could mean is that alternative solutions are gaining steam, and the company is having to tweak its prices slightly.\nThis could be a drop in the bucket and have no real meaning over the long term. But if worthy competition does arise and Nvidia's profit margins fall back to historical levels, the stock could be in trouble.\nIf Nvidia's margins reverted back to historical levels, it wouldn't be good for the stock.\nLet's assume the gross profit margin falls back to normal levels (60%) and its current operating expense level is maintained. That would give Nvidia net income of $12.2 billion (if the second quarter's tax rate is used). That would be a 27% decline from today's levels.\nThe expectations that are built into Nvidia's stock are extraordinary: It trades for 55 times trailing earnings and 41 times forward earnings.\nIf you reduce the denominator of the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) by 27%, these figures would rise to 75.6 times trailing earnings and 56.5 times forward earnings.\nThat's even more expensive, and the stock might not command that premium with growth rates starting to slow down due to year-over-year comparisons becoming more difficult.\nSo, I wouldn't be surprised if the stock price declined by a similar amount. That's only if I could snap my fingers and see Nvidia's margins instantly decline. In reality, a decline like this would take some time to play out.\nI'm not saying that Nvidia's margins will fall back to previous levels. However, investors should consider that the new margin levels are vital to the investment thesis.\nIf the gross margin continues to compress and then starts to fall, then the stock will likely follow suit. However, unless Nvidia's competitors (or its current customers) launch a product that can rival its GPUs, its elevated gross margins could be permanent.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of Morgan Stanley's Best Stock Picks: 15 Stocks To Own For 2025.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Morgan Stanley's other stock picks.\nThe tail end of 2024 is seeing a market shift in the stock market as the Federal Reserve has finally signaled that interest rate cuts are on the horizon. This means that cheaper capital might be on the horizon, with the rate cuts coming just as the labor market starts to feel the pinch through lower growth.\nIt also means that consumer spending can pick up if economic output remains robust. For investors, it creates an opportunity to gain an early foothold into stocks that could benefit from the new environment. On this front, investment banks have been analyzing the situation diligently for quite some time.\nOne bank that's out with regular reports is Morgan Stanley. It releases monthly reports that cover the latest trends in the economy and the stock market. The bank's August report covered some recent trends. It shared that the labor market was one of its most closely watched economic indicators as it was \"vulnerable to a further deceleration in economic activity.\" To explain why, the bank shared that US excess labor supply, that is the demand minus supply, was at pre pandemic levels that had sustained since 2018. This implies that employers no longer have the incentive to offer lucrative pay packages to attract workers, which in turn leads to less money flowing into the economy to contribute to inflation.\nMS added that the three month national unemployment average was 0.5% above the 12 month average, which is a warning bell for the economy. This is because according to one of the most widely used recession indicators, the Sahm Rule, a recession has started once the rate is 0.5% or higher than the 12 month average. MS is not the only one that is ringing warning bells on this front, as JPM also confirmed in early August that the rule was triggered when the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3%. However, it did add that we \"do not think a recession is imminent\" and \"remain constructive on U.S. equities despite increased volatility, and see opportunity to lock in rates before they fall.\"\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\nReturning to MS, it also sees an opportunity in the battered commercial real estate market. It cites the commercial real estate cap rate, which is the rate of return based on its income generation capability, to argue that commercial real estate valuations are currently depressed enough to warrant an investment. The office real estate market had a cap rate of 9% in March 2024 as per MS, for a two percentage point and three percentage point lead over retail and residential real estate, respectively. As for the stock market, the bank shared in August that it still prefers large cap stocks (an important point as you'll find out when you check out the stocks in this piece).\nThe bank believes that small caps \"are lower in quality, more volatile and carry greater exposure to cyclical sectors relative to large cap,\" meaning that their outperformance \"requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates.\" MS warned that \"softer economic data may constrain\" small cap performance. In terms of data, it argues that small cap performance is dependent on bond yields. This data set shows that when we assume an index value of 100 for US small caps had led benchmark S&P stocks except the Magnificent 7 at a time when 10 year US bond yields were around 1.5% in July 2021, the indexed returns dropped to 90 in July 2023 when the yields were approximately 4.3%.\nAugust's final week was pivotal for the stock market as Fed Chair Jerome Powell finally signaled that the time for interest rates had come. \"The time has come for policy to adjust,\" stated Powell at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. \"The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\" he added.\nFollowing the Fed Chair's remarks, MS was out with its September report. Commenting on the economy, the bank shared that it does not \"believe the economy is set to accelerate over the next few months, which makes the S&P 500 around 5650 our near-term upper bound. At the same time, the economy is not collapsing, which makes 5200 attractive and 5350 seem fair. We plan to trade around the ranges.\" MS also shares key details for the unemployment rate, which are important when analyzed in tandem with the Sahm Rule. It comments that higher immigration \"may be supporting a higher labor force participation rate, which in turn would contribute to a higher reported unemployment rate. From this perspective, a higher unemployment rate is not signaling weakness but rather an increase in the labor supply that would help bring inflation down without affecting growth.\"\nSubsequently, the bank believes that the percentage of total unemployed accounted for by people who lost their jobs (Job Losers) and the number of total layoffs (Challenger Layoffs) might be more relevant when analyzing the labor market. Job Losers currently sit at 50%, while Challenger Layoffs are less than 50,000 after having jumped to 100,000. In short, this paints a more robust labor market picture that might not signal a recession as the Sahm Rule might have suggested.\nRemaining bearish on small caps, it believes that the \"window for small cap outperformance is too narrow \u2013 requiring \u201cGoldilocks\u201d growth and inflation.\" This sentiment is also echoed in the bank's Vintage Values 2025 stock report, where it comments that its strategists \"currently recommend avoiding small caps, and Vintage Values 2025 reflects that view. It skews heavily toward large-cap stocks: 80% of the names are classified as either mega-cap or large-cap.\" Mind you, this sentiment was also echoed in the 2024 report, verbatim.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of MS' top stocks for 2025, we ranked MS' Vintage Value 2025 stock picks by their share price percentage upside based on the bank's price target.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Its GPUs, which offer businesses the ability to accelerate their workloads, are also key to its hypothesis. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s rapid share price growth of 715% since 2023 started is built on Wall Street's optimism of its GPUs being heavily demanded for enterprise computing use cases. Artificial intelligence is also one of these use cases, and as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have lost 12% since their June peak, the firm has sought to slightly shift the narrative. At a recent conference, CEO Jensen Huang shared that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also plays in a non AI $1 trillion market for GPUs that will help accelerate computing that has slowed down over the years due to physical limitations of CPU design. Naturally, this means that as long as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to design superior products and there is demand for them, its shares perform well. However, any inventory glut or growth in custom chips by the likes of Amazon and Meta could spell trouble.\nBaron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\u201cMore recently, however, we\u2019ve entered the period of doubts and questioning, some of which is real and normal in the first stages of a new paradigm, and some of which is prompted by short sellers. Given the explosive returns of NVIDIA and other AI leaders, AI bears and fear mongers have been comparing the current AI market winners with the internet bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, and NVIDIA\u2019s stock move today with Cisco\u2019s back then. First, while many stocks were trading at nosebleed valuations and on made up metrics (such as price per eyeballs) before the bursting of the internet bubble, as we\u2019ve said many times, the internet proved to transform our world and create the digital age we are now living in. Second, while NVIDIA\u2019s stock price inflection has been nothing short of unprecedented for a company of its size, it was fueled almost entirely by explosive growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows\u2013 not multiple expansion. Over the last 12 months, NVIDIA\u2019s stock has eectively tripled, but its forward P/E multiple has remained essentially flat, because NVIDIA blew away Wall Street expectations despite being covered by over 60 sell-side analysts, who have increased their forward projections every single quarter. In my career, the only comparative analogue is when Apple first introduced the iPhone and stunned Wall Street with its growth. In contrast, most of Cisco\u2019s move in the late 1990s was due to multiple expansion. At its peak, Cisco traded at a P/E ratio over 130 times, more than quadruple its five-year average of 37 times. At the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA traded at a P/E ratio of 40 times, equal to its five-year average, and at a P/E to growth (or PEG) ratio for 2025 of 0.8 times, as consensus expectations are for NVIDIA to grow earnings per share 40% next year.\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of Morgan Stanley's best stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Investors\u2019 favorite AI play, Nvidia, has been on thin ice in recent weeks. Concerns about its rich valuation, new pressure from antitrust regulators, the sustainability of the AI boom, and the impact of the slowing U.S. economy have spooked even some of the chipmaker\u2019s most ardent defenders.\nNvidia stock has dropped roughly 18% since Aug. 19, with the majority of the damage coming after a 9.5% plunge on Tuesday that erased a record $279 billion in market cap.\nJust after the dark day of trading for Nvidia, Bloomberg reported that the U.S Department of Justice (DOJ) has ramped up its antitrust probe against the company. DOJ officials reportedly sent a subpoena to Nvidia, and other involved companies, which includes \u201clegally binding requests that oblige recipients to provide information,\u201d according to unnamed Bloomberg sources familiar with the matter. Subpoenas often precede the filing of a formal complaint against a company under investigation.\nDOJ officials have expressed concern that Nvidia makes it difficult for its customers to switch to new suppliers and penalizes those that don\u2019t exclusively use its AI chips, according to Bloomberg\u2019s sources. The DOJ investigation into Nvidia began in July, The Information first reported, after similar allegations from competitors about Nvidia\u2019s pricing strategies.\nIn a statement to Fortune, Nvidia said that it \u201cwins on merit\u201d and customers are free to choose whatever solution works best for them, adding that the company \u201cscrupulously\u201d adheres to all laws.\n\u201cWe have inquired with the U.S. Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed. Nonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business,\u201d a representative added.\nStill, the tech world\u2019s issues with Nvidia\u2019s tactics certainly seem to be widespread.\n\u201cAll of Nvidia\u2019s competitors have issued grievances with me. I\u2019m not going to name them, but you can imagine who they might be,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, a technology analyst and advisory firm, told Fortune.\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s customers haven\u2019t talked about any of these tactics, but they have talked about the desire to have\u2014what words did they use\u2014a more \u2018balanced supply chain,\u2019\u201d he added.\nNvidia\u2019s April acquisition of RunAI, which provides AI computation software, is also under the DOJ\u2019s microscope, per Bloomberg\u2019s report. There are concerns that the purchase will further strengthen Nvidia\u2019s grip on the entire AI chip supply chain, making it more challenging for its customers to switch to competitors\u2019 products.\nOverall, Moorhead believes this could end up being \u201ca very serious probe\u201d for Nvidia, which could slow its business slightly, force the company to open up some of its software platform for use by competitors, or, eventually, lead to a significant fine.\n\u201cThe reason I say that is first of all, technically, Nvidia is a monopoly. Second, AI is super important to society, economics, and business today and into the future. So it\u2019s a super hot-button [issue]. And that means regulators are super motivated to do something,\u201d he warned.\nNvidia controls roughly 90% of the AI-critical next-generation chip market, and it has made big steps toward vertical integration in recent years, branding itself as not just a chip company but an \u201cAI platform enterprise.\u201d\nThe impressive market share gains and suite of both software and hardware AI offerings have made Nvidia a monopoly in the view of many experts, but the DOJ will have to prove more than just that.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not illegal to be a monopoly. It\u2019s illegal\u2014if you\u2019re a monopoly\u2014to squash competition and harm consumers,\u201d Moorhead noted.\nTying agreements, where a seller ties the sale of one product to the purchase of another, are one of the ways Nvidia is allegedly abusing its monopoly power. These agreements, also called \u201ctie-in\u201d sales, are not always illegal, but can be challenged under four provisions of antitrust laws, according to the DOJ.\nBoth section one and section two of the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, which prohibit the \u201crestraint of trade\u201d and make it illegal to \u201cmonopolize,\u201d can be used to challenge tying agreements. Similarly, the DOJ could rely on section three of the 1914 Clayton Antitrust Act, which forbids acts that will \u201csubstantially lessen competition,\u201d or section five of the 1914 Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits \u201cunfair competition.\u201d\nJim Keller, CEO of AI chipmaker Tenstorrent, an Nvidia competitor, told The Information in August that Nvidia\u2019s sales tactics are not illegal, in his view, but he admitted customers often \u201cfeel pressured to buy Nvidia\u2019s networking gear to guarantee themselves access to the company\u2019s vaunted AI server chips.\u201d\nWhile the DOJ is investigating claims of tying agreements, they will likely have to prove that the tying was done with official contracts, rather than merely \u201cpressure.\u201d\nBut that may be difficult to do, according to Scott Bickley, practice lead and principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group, a tech research and advisory firm. He noted that semiconductors have always been dished out on allocation schedules, with contracts both parties agree to in advance, and Nvidia isn\u2019t being accused of breaching any contracts.\n\u201cOf course, they\u2019re going to try to sell their gear\u2014which they will probably say is more compatible, that you\u2019ll get a better quality experience if you run Nvidia chips with Nvidia racks and things like that. But to my understanding, and from what I\u2019m hearing, they haven\u2019t forced that. They're heavily encouraging it, but they\u2019re allowing their biggest customers to utilize their own gear and their own hardware for their data center designs,\u201d he explained.\nBickley argued that the tying agreement beef is largely a jockeying match for pricing between Nvidia and its very influential and powerful big tech clients in a space with little to no serious competition.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Nvidia\u2019s doing anything\u2014that I can see, at least on the surface\u2014that would be breaking the law,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019ve just become the 800-pound gorilla in a space where there\u2019s not any other 800-pound gorillas to fight them off at this point.\u201d\nThe potential use of exclusionary rebates is likely another reason the DOJ could be investigating Nvidia for antitrust violations. \u201c[Those say] I\u2019m only going to give you this good price if you don\u2019t buy the competition. It\u2019s not volume-based pricing, it\u2019s exclusionary-based pricing,\u201d Moorhead explained, noting, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that if you\u2019re a monopoly.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s software platform CUDA might also be under the microscope. CUDA is used in everything from low-level drivers to generative AI models, and it isn\u2019t open to competitors like AMD or Intel to use.\n\u201cNow, if you\u2019re not a monopoly, that\u2019s fine. If you have monopolist powers, people might look at that and say, well, \u2018You\u2019re more in the marketplace business, right?\u2019\u201d Moorhead said, explaining: \u201cIn that case, you have so much power you have to open this up, even if it\u2019s [to] your competitors.\u201d\nStill, Bickley argued that Nvidia is simply utilizing its technology advantage to increase profits and gain market share, rather than engaging in anticompetitive behavior. Attempting to fine, break up, or slow Nvidia would only impede the development of AI in his view.\n\u201cWhat we need is some good, old-fashioned innovation,\u201d Bickley argued. \u201cYou know, have some other companies come out with competing products and technologies that start to siphon away some of that investment from Nvidia.\u201d\nNvidia could face significant challenges if a DOJ investigation finds antitrust violations, experts say. But even if there aren\u2019t any violations, the chipmaker\u2019s business operations could be slowed, at least slightly, by the investigation.\n\u201cWhen anybody has the Department of Justice looking at them, it slows things down,\u201d Moorhead explained, likening it to putting small bits of sand in a gas tank. \u201cYou have to have a lawyer approve your allocations. You have to have a lawyer approve your pricing. You have to have a lawyer\u2014in meetings that you normally wouldn't have a lawyer in.\u201d\nNvidia could also be forced to open up its CUDA software platform to competitors in a worst-case scenario, leading to increased competition. \u201cApple had to open up the App Store, and Microsoft had to open up its API with Internet Explorer; this would likely be something like that, which would enable AMD, Intel, and others \u2026 to tap into CUDA on an equal basis,\u201d Moorhead explained.\nIf the DOJ is able to prove Nvidia acted illegally, it may need to pay heavy fines as well, and not just in the U.S. \u201cI do believe that this case is going to spread to the EU, Korea, Japan, and likely Taiwan\u2014probably not China\u2014which, again, just makes the scrutiny even higher. But essentially, it\u2019s paying a fine,\u201d Moorhead said.\nHowever, neither Moorhead nor Bickley believes these fines will dramatically impact Nvidia\u2019s business, in large part owing to the company\u2019s distinct technology advantage and surging revenues. Both experts also noted that it will take months, or more likely years, for the DOJ\u2019s investigation to conclude.\n\u201cBy the time it comes to a conclusion, whatever that conclusion is, the money will have been made by Nvidia, so any fine that they put forward will be basically pocket change,\u201d Bickley said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will have any material impact at all on them and their earnings and their financial position.\u201d\nBickley doesn\u2019t see the DOJ\u2019s case as likely to succeed, either, despite investors\u2019 negative reaction to news of the investigation. \u201cI don\u2019t really see a path for them to come up with any type of true anticompetitive judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to come up much.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\nWall Street analysts are urging investors to take advantage of the recent pullback in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares. Despite the AI giant\u2019s quarterly forecast falling short of the lofty expectations set by investors, who have driven a massive rally in its stock on hopes for generative AI, analysts remain bullish.\nNvidia's shares dropped more than 6% on Thursday after the fiscal Q2 report was released. While the company reported significant growth and profit, the results were viewed as mixed, as revenue and gross margin projections didn\u2019t surpass Wall Street's lofty targets as they had in previous quarters.\nUBS analysts, however, believe investors should \u201cbuy the pullback,\u201d noting that key indicators for Nvidia remain bullish. The bank specifically pointed to the surge in Nvidia\u2019s purchase commitments and supply obligations, describing this as \u201cthe most important metric we watch and a harbinger of future growth.\u201d\nUBS analysts also expressed confidence in Nvidia's margins, stating they are not concerned about gross margins and expect data center margins to stay consistent through the Blackwell cycle, mirroring the stability seen during the Hopper cycle.\nSimilarly, Bank of America analysts reiterated their Buy rating on Nvidia stock following the report and raised the target price from $150 to $165.\nBofA acknowledged that the stock is \u201clikely to be volatile\u201d in the near term due to Nvidia\u2019s projections missing elevated expectations, and noted that rising Blackwell ramp costs could impact Q3 margins.\nNonetheless, BofA remains confident in Nvidia\u2019s long-term prospects, stressing that they \u201ccontinue to believe in NVDA\u2019s unique growth opportunity, execution and dominant 80%+ share as generative AI deployments are still in their first 1-1.5 years of what is at least a 3-4 year upfront investment cycle.\u201d\n\u201cAI deployment remains a mission-critical imperative for global cloud and enterprise customers, with NVDA providing the best turnkey model.\u201d\nCiti analysts have elevated Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to their \u201ctop AI pick\u201d for 2025, surpassing both Nvidia and Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET). This move comes as Apple gears up to unveil its iPhone 16 lineup at the \u201cIt\u2019s Glowtime\u201d product event on September 9th.\nAt the event, Apple is expected to introduce several key updates, including A18 chips utilizing the N3E process with an enhanced neural engine, improved camera and microphone features, and an upgraded modem for the Pro models.\n\u201cApple\u2019s September event is generally all about hardware updates, but we believe the company will put a lot of focus on how the hardware updates for the iPhone 16 family can better support its Apple Intelligence features that are expected to roll out officially later in the fall,\u201d Citi analysts remarked.\nLooking ahead, Citi expects a major refresh with the iPhone 17 next year, with AI features gradually being introduced over the coming year. This phased rollout is expected to give developers time to create apps and allow Apple to build customer recognition.\nCiti projects iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 unit sales to reach 85 million and 92 million in calendar years 2024 and 2025, respectively. Total iPhone units are expected to hit 228 million in 2024 and 241 million in 2025.\nThe analysts also highlighted that \u201cAAPL stock on average outperformed the broader market since 2016 by 5%-6% over the period from June-quarter earnings date into the September iPhone release date.\u201d\nInvestors should be more concerned about the potential bursting of the AI bubble than a looming U.S. or global recession, according to strategists at BCA Research. The firm\u2019s analysis suggests that the risks associated with the rapidly growing AI sector are more serious than those posed by broader economic downturns.\n\"When bubbles burst, the investment priority is to steer well clear of the bursting bubble plus sectors, regions, and countries heavily exposed to it.\" This implies that regardless of whether a recession follows the collapse of the bubble, the primary focus should be on avoiding the areas most impacted by the fallout.\nIn line with this, BCA Research advises investors to underweight U.S. tech and quasi-tech sectors, which are closely tied to the AI boom, and to reduce their exposure to U.S. equities within a global portfolio.\n\"Investors should worry much less about a U.S. or global recession than they should worry about the bubble in anything AI-related,\u201d BCA noted.\nWith the AI sector continuing to attract significant attention and capital, BCA warns that the potential for a sharp correction poses a noteworthy threat.\nWilliam Blair has initiated research coverage of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) with an Outperform (Buy) rating, primarily driven by the underappreciated potential of Tesla's energy storage business.\nThe firm believes that Tesla Energy, particularly its Megapack and Powerwall products, could emerge as a significant growth driver, especially as expectations for the electric vehicle (EV) segment moderate in the near term.\n\u201cWe view Tesla Energy as the most underappreciated component of the Tesla story and expect the narrative will shift toward the energy storage business in light of tempered EV expectations in the near term.\"\nThe analysts highlight three key factors that make Tesla's energy storage business a compelling investment: the need for grid stabilization, the expansion of data centers, and the integration of renewable energy sources.\nThese aspects, alongside Tesla's broader automotive business and emerging opportunities in AI, robotaxis, and robotics, position the company as a technology leader with what William Blair describes as an \"Apple-esque ecosystem for the future of energy.\"\n\"Energy is the foundation for life, an abundance or lack of which determines how far society can reach on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\"\nTesla's approach to energy, through its more efficient EVs, energy storage solutions, and innovations like robotaxis and humanoid robots, aims to revolutionize how energy is created, stored, and utilized, with broad societal implications.\nWhile Tesla's current valuation may appear high by traditional metrics, William Blair argues that this premium is justified.\n\"Using traditional comparable analysis with auto or even tech, we understand the difficulty justifying the valuation, but in our opinion, this misunderstands the Tesla story.\"\nThey believe that the halo effect created by Elon Musk, the company\u2019s culture of first principles, and its technological advantages warrant the valuation premium.\nCiti analysts maintained their Buy rating on Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) stock with a $91 price target, based on an 18% higher-than-consensus CY25 earnings per share (EPS) following the July-quarter results.\nThe investment bank sees Marvell capitalizing on strong AI investments to rapidly expand its AI ASIC business, with four AI ASIC projects in the pipeline\u2014two currently ramping up, one expected in 2025, and another in 2026.\nMoreover, Citi is adding a Positive Catalyst Watch ahead of next week's Technology Conference, where Marvell's CEO Matt Murphy will participate in a fireside chat.\n\"We expect management to sound bullish on AI growth exceeding prior 2024/25 AI sales targets and all non-AI end markets to recover in 2H24,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\"MRVL stock typically outperforms when all its end markets move in the same direction,\u201d they added.\nRelated Articles\n5 big analyst AI moves: \u2018Buy Nvidia pullback,\u2019 Apple named Top AI Pick\nMorgan Stanley updated its Dividend Equity Portfolio, dropped this big tech name\nWhat are implications of potential PlayStation 5 Pro launch on Sony's financials\n"

        "Author": "  Nilanjan Banerjee ",
        "Text": "The demand for NVIDIA\u2019s NVDA graphic processing units (GPUs) has surged significantly, positioning it as a leading player in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and one of the world's most valuable companies. NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated computing is transforming various industries, including oil and gas, by expediting complex calculations and enhancing data analysis. This technology improves seismic imaging, reservoir simulations and real-time data analysis, all of which are essential for locating oil and gas reserves more quickly and accurately.\nEnergy giants like Shell plc SHEL, SLB SLB and Petrobras PBR are well-positioned to benefit from this trend, as they already leverage NVIDIA GPUs to conduct complex simulations and boost productivity. This adoption is driving more efficient and sustainable operations in the sector.\nNVIDIA's GPUs provide substantial benefits to oil and gas companies by significantly improving the speed and precision of their operations, especially upstream activities. A major advantage is seen in seismic imaging, where the parallel computing capabilities of GPUs greatly accelerate data processing. This enables companies to produce detailed subsurface images much faster than traditional CPU-based systems. The quicker imaging allows for faster identification of potential reservoirs, which enhances exploration decisions and helps reduce both the time and cost involved in locating oil and gas deposits.\nNVIDIA\u2019s GPUs also optimize reservoir simulations and real-time data analysis. Reservoir simulations, which model the movement of oil and gas within underground formations, are computationally intensive and typically slow. By leveraging GPUs, companies can run more accurate models in real time, enabling quicker, data-driven decisions and optimized extraction processes. Additionally, real-time data analysis powered by GPUs allows continuous monitoring of operations, predicting equipment failures and improving overall operational efficiency, reducing costs and mitigating risks.\nShell: Accelerating Upstream Activities With NVIDIA AI\nShell's utilization of NVIDIA DGX A100 systems, based on NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, for seismic processing enhances its capability to create more precise reservoir models by enabling iterative image reconstructions. This technology allows Shell to more effectively map subsurface structures, identifying critical features such as salt boundaries that impact hydrocarbon flow.\nBy harnessing these advanced tools, Shell not only increases the efficiency of locating and managing oil reserves but also accelerates data-driven decision-making that aligns with its sustainability goals. For instance, more accurate models help reduce unnecessary drilling, leading to cost savings and a minimized environmental footprint.\nIt currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nPetrobras: Identifying New Reserves While Employing GPUs\nThe #3 Ranked Petrobras has integrated NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs, particularly the Tesla K10 model, into its operations to boost seismic data processing capabilities. This integration allows Petrobras to handle complex computational tasks more efficiently, including reverse time migration, full waveform inversion, and Kirchhoff time/depth migration.\nThese sophisticated algorithms enhance the precision of seismic imaging, enabling Petrobras to more accurately identify new oil and gas reserves. Paulo Souza, a developer in the Geophysical Technology Group at Petrobras RTM, noted that their seismic application runs 1.8 times faster on the Tesla K10 compared to the Tesla M2090 GPU, greatly accelerating the process of discovering and safely accessing new reserves.\nNVIDIA A100's MIG Feature Lets SLB Run Multiple Simulations \nSLB, with a Zacks Rank of 3, has experienced significant benefits from using NVIDIA\u2019s A100 80GB Tensor Core GPUs with its INTERSECT high-resolution reservoir simulator. Compared to traditional CPU-based systems, these GPUs provide substantial performance improvements.\nThe Multi-Instance GPU feature of NVIDIA's A100 allows SLB to run multiple simulations concurrently, boosting throughput by up to 7.5x for larger models (2.3 million cells) and up to 11x for smaller models (575,000 cells). This results in considerable time savings, enabling SLB to perform up to 1,571 daily simulations instead of just 143 with CPUs. Using NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs enhances computational performance and significantly improves operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock started off September not with a bang but with a whimper. Late last week, the company reported the results of its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), and while the results were better than expected, they weren't as robust as some investors had hoped.\nThe stock was under pressure again on Tuesday, falling as much as 8.4%. As of 12:27 p.m. ET, the stock was still down 7.8%.\nDespite some ongoing uncertainty, investors should take a step back and look at the big picture.\nSome investors have become skittish about Nvidia stock in recent weeks, and it's easy to understand why. After five consecutive quarters of triple-digit year-over-year growth, management is forecasting a moderate deceleration, guiding for revenue growth of 80% in the third quarter. Sure, that's slower than it has been, but it's enviable growth nonetheless.\nAnother issue weighing on investor sentiment is Nvidia's waning gross margin of 75.1%. While that's an increase compared to 70.1% in the prior-year quarter, it's down from 78.4% in the first quarter. Some investors fear this could be the beginning of a new trend, but that conclusion is premature. Nvidia is scheduled to begin shipping its next-generation Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) processors later this year, and previous new product launches have improved margins. This time will likely be no different.\nFinally, stories emerged over the weekend of a tussle between China and Japan regarding sanctions on advanced chipmaking equipment, with the former threatening \"economic retaliation,\" according to a report by Bloomberg. This disagreement could potentially spill over into the broader AI sector, but it's simply too early to tell.\nThanks to soaring AI adoption, Nvidia stock has gained more than 650% since early last year (as of this writing) and has seen a commensurate jump in its valuation, currently selling for roughly 38 times forward sales. While that's certainly a premium, Nvidia's track record shows it's worth paying up for.\nIt's still early days for the adoption of generative AI, with the market expected to be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. That shows there's still plenty of time for Nvidia to continue tapping this emerging opportunity.\nThat's why Nvidia stock is a buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Sell Nvidia, Buy Arm?",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has delighted its shareholders with a return of nearly 1,000% since the start of 2023, but Thursday brought investors a rare post-earnings drop as the AI chip leader closed down 6.4% for the day.\nWhile the company beat headline estimates on the top and bottom lines, the sell-off in the stock seemed to have more to do with valuation and growth concerns.\nNvidia is now worth $3 trillion, meaning the upside for the stock has become more limited even as it's still posting blowout growth. Revenue was up 122% in the second quarter to $30 billion, and adjusted earnings per share were up 152% to $0.68.\nWhat was also surprising about the market's reaction to the news is that although Nvidia shares fell, many of its AI chip stock peers were up for most of the session, and one, in particular, was a big winner. That was Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM), which finished the day up 5.3% even though there was no company-specific news out on the stock.\nIn other words, investors seem to think that Nvidia's results were good news for the broader AI sector as they indicated strong demand for its chips, but they no longer see Nvidia as the best way to play the AI boom.\nIs Arm a better AI stock to own than Nvidia now? Let's take a closer look at the two companies to find out.\nNvidia and Arm work closely together. Arguably, no other company has benefited more directly from Nvidia's success than Arm.\nNvidia uses Arm's CPU architecture in a number of its components, most notably the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips, which, according to Nvidia, are designed for giant-scale AI and high-performance computing applications.\nNvidia is also using Arm's Grace CPU for its next-generation Grace Blackwell Superchips, which feature liquid cooling and are part of the Nvidia GB200 NVL72 that will provide up to a 30x performance increase over traditional Nvidia H100 GPUs. Arm CEO Rene Haas said Grace Blackwell would be a \"very, very good chip for us in the AI data center.\"\nPart of Arm's attraction to investors looking to diversify away from Nvidia is that its unique business model means it's yet to capture much of the benefit from the explosion in demand for AI chips.\nUnlike its chip stock peers, Arm makes money from licensing its architecture to companies like Nvidia, which then put it in their chips. Arm collects revenue in two ways. It makes money when it sells licenses, and it makes money through royalties later on when those products start to sell.\nThere tends to be a lag of two to three years between collecting revenue from a new license and the royalty from the product with that license, so Arm has yet to collect significant royalties from the generative AI boom.\nHowever, licensing revenue has already soared, up 72% to $472 million in its most recent quarter. Arm attributed that surge to multiple high-value license agreements from thought-leading companies.\nBased on the jump in licensing revenue, we should see a surge in royalties, which generally make up the majority of Arm's revenue, in 2026 or 2027.\nWhile investors seemed to be rotating from Nvidia to Arm on Thursday, you might be surprised to learn that Nvidia is still the cheaper stock of the two. On a trailing price-to-earnings basis, Nvidia is now valued at a multiple based on adjusted EPS of 53, compared to Arm at 94.\nArm is also more expensive on price-to-sales basis at a multiple of 38, compared to Nvidia at 32.\nBoth companies generate huge margins, but Nvidia is still the faster growing of the two. However, that could change in the coming quarters as Arm's royalty revenue starts to kick in.\nThe biggest advantage Arm has over Nvidia is that it's easier for the stock to double, as its market cap is much lower than Nvidia's and its potential doesn't seem as fully understood by the market as Nvidia's. Arm has the greater potential to surprise to the upside.\nStill, selling Nvidia to buy Arm doesn't seem quite right; Nvidia's competitive advantages are just as strong as they were before the report, if not stronger.\nNvidia stock probably won't double again anytime soon, but it still deserves a place in any AI stock portfolio. Holding shares of both Nvidia and Arm, two dominant leaders in their respective categories, makes the most sense for AI stock investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Arm Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Jim Cramer Reports \u2018Nvidia Shares Are Lower Monday\u2019",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Top Stock Picks: 10 Stocks with High Potential. In this article, we will have a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the 10 stocks with high potential.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer explains the current split between tech stocks and other sectors, noting that they often move in opposite directions. For instance, on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 228 points and the S&P 500 rose by 0.13%, the NASDAQ\u2014which is heavily weighted with tech stocks\u2014fell by 0.52%.\n\u201cHow did we get to this bizarre dichotomy between tech stocks and pretty much everything else, where the two groups now almost always seem to move in opposite directions? Take today: the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 228 points, the S&P advanced 0.13%, but the NASDAQ\u2014with all that tech in it\u2014dropped a bomb. Yes, it fell 0.52%. How could there be such a schism?\u201d\nAs a result, large institutions must shift investments between sectors since they can\u2019t invest in both simultaneously. This situation is driven by market mechanics rather than fundamental news. When stocks are already performing well, attracting new investment is challenging, especially when safer investments offer decent returns. Consequently, either tech stocks or other sectors will perform well, but not both at the same time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because there\u2019s not enough money coming in from the sidelines, so these big institutions have to swap out of one group if they want to buy stock in another. Yet this action has nothing to do with fundamentals; it\u2019s not about the news, it\u2019s about pure market mechanics. When stocks are already red hot, it\u2019s hard to attract new capital from the sidelines, especially when you can get a cozy 4% return for doing nothing. So, either tech wins or everything else wins, but there\u2019s not enough cash for both of them to win at the same time.\u201d\nCramer points out that this scenario leads to clear winners and losers instead of a spectrum of performance on a positive day. This is happening alongside uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points in their upcoming meeting.\n\u201cWhat happens? We get winners and losers\u2014not big winners and smaller winners, as you would normally expect on an up day like today. This is all against the backdrop of the big question: will the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points or 50 when it meets on Wednesday?\nCramer also mentions that despite his tendency to avoid speculating on the Fed\u2019s actions, recent market movements have been influenced by expectations about rate cuts. For instance, when The Wall Street Journal suggested that the Fed might opt for a 50 basis point cut, there was a significant shift toward cyclical stocks, especially those linked to housing. This shift, combined with other positive news, led to the best week of the year for the market.\n\u201cThis leads me to this newfound great divide between tech and non-tech, because that\u2019s how this market seems to be trading. It\u2019s a big reason why I\u2019m out here in Silicon Valley this week. Today, we saw a market that doesn\u2019t believe in AI, AI, or tech in general, for that matter. It\u2019s a market that believes a 50-basis-point rate cut will shift money from semiconductors to housing and anything housing-related, and people want to get ahead of that.\u201d\nJim Cramer observed that Monday\u2019s market saw a broadening of winners. Healthcare stocks, retailers, and consumer packaged goods companies all performed well. Even oil stocks, which have been struggling, are making a comeback. This is unusual because typically when cyclical stocks rally, sectors like healthcare and consumer products would decline. However, Cramer attributes this trend to a broader market shift he refers to as \u201cABT,\u201d which stands for \u201canything but tech.\u201d In other words, today\u2019s market focus is on sectors outside of technology.\n\u201cToday, the winners broadened out. The healthcare stocks got jiggy, retailers worked, and consumer packaged goods companies outperformed. Even the much-maligned oils are rallying. It\u2019s crazy\u2014healthcare and consumer products should be selling off when cyclicals rally, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening because it\u2019s *ABT*. No, I\u2019m not talking about the symbol for Abbott Labs. ABT means \u201canything but tech,\u201d and that\u2019s what today\u2019s market was about.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nThis article provides a summary of Jim Cramer\u2019s latest\u00a0Morning Thoughts, where he reviewed several stocks. We\u2019ve chosen the ten most noteworthy companies he mentioned and ranked them according to how much they are owned by hedge funds, starting with the least owned and moving to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nJim Cramer noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are down on Monday, but this appears to be just profit-taking after the AI chipmaker\u2019s stock surged nearly 16% last week.\n\u201cNvidia shares are lower Monday. It looks like nothing more than profit-taking after the leading AI chipmaker surged nearly 16% last week.\u201d\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) presents a strong investment opportunity due to its leading role in the growing AI and data center markets. In Q2 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported record revenue of $30 billion, a 122% increase from the previous year, driven by a 154% surge in its data center segment. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s GPUs are essential for AI applications, positioning Nvidia to capitalize on the AI boom.\nIts advancements in both hardware and software reinforce its dominance in the tech industry. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s key presence in high-demand areas like data centers and autonomous systems, combined with its leadership in AI and machine learning, suggests strong potential for ongoing revenue growth and high profit margins. This makes NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) an attractive long-term investment.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks with high potential. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "It's been quite the year for artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which has seen its stock rise more than 161% year to date. Over the last five years, Nvidia's stock is up by more than an astounding 2,560%.\nIn doing so, Nvidia has reached a nosebleed valuation and now trades at 40 times forward earnings. Investors believe that Nvidia's stock doesn't have a ceiling right now, considering the potential of AI to disrupt life as we know it.\nHowever, one Wall Street analyst is certainly not ready to call it quits yet. He thinks Nvidia is poised for a big year ahead. Here's why.\nWilliam Blair analyst Sebastien Naji initiated coverage of Nvidia on Wednesday, with an \"outperform\" rating and a $162 price target, implying 41% upside from Nvidia's stock price of roughly $115 on Wednesday morning.\nNaji's thesis is that the market has yet to price in Nvidia's total addressable market for the broader semiconductor market and is currently only considering the total addressable market (TAM) from graphic processing units, which is Nvidia's bread and butter.\n\"Nvidia's technical differentiation extends beyond building state-of-the-art processors to include fully integrated systems,\" Naji wrote in his initiation coverage. \"Specifically, Nvidia has built a deep software ecosystem ... and developed core competencies in networking (through its acquisitions of Mellanox and Cumulus), systems engineering, and supply chain management.\"\nSpecifically, Naji only sees a TAM of about $100 million for graphic processing units. But the TAM for the broader semiconductor could be eight times bigger, he estimates, while the TAM for cloud services could be 16 times bigger.\nWhile I would agree that we don't yet know the potential of AI, I do start to worry about stocks with these huge valuations because the margin for error becomes very narrow. Also, estimating the size of TAMs and what specific companies can capture is not easy. Long-term shareholders can certainly buy Nvidia, but I wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback or some volatility in the near term.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Loses $470 Billion in Value in a Week. Should Investors Be Worried?",
        "Author": "  Johnny Rice, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) industry doesn't have quite the sheen as it did earlier this summer. Investors have become increasingly wary of the technology's ability to deliver real-world value -- at least in a time frame that justifies the sky-high stock valuations investors have seen.\nAt the heart of this lies the technology's posterchild, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker's stock is down about 15% since it reported second-quarter earnings on Aug. 28. That's nearly half-a-trillion dollars -- $470 billion -- in market capitalization wiped out in a week. It's an incredible amount. There are only 15 companies on the planet with a market cap that exceeds what the company lost in a week. That shows just how big Nvidia is.\nThat kind of drop may make you nervous. It makes me nervous. Before you jump ship, however, let's consider some more context.\nMost companies in the AI space are getting hammered. It's not just AI though; the whole market is down. There are a lot of factors at play. For starters, investors are looking to see more data -- like a new jobs report -- that will help indicate the direction the economy is headed. Tied to this will be the Fed's decision in the coming weeks on whether to cut rates and, critically, by how much. So Nvidia's slide comes as the market as a whole is down; the company is not alone.\nAnother likely factor to consider is that many investors are simply taking a profit. Some were likely waiting to see if the company's Q2 report would blow expectations out of the water once again. Although in many ways it did exceed expectations, it wasn't enough to send the stock flying, and it didn't indicate what might be just around the corner. These investors are choosing to realize the incredible returns they've seen over the past few years given they don't believe the stock is going to jump anytime soon.\nWhatever the reason Nvidia's stock dropped, it's not that important in the long run. This is a distraction. \u00a0Do you still believe in Nvidia's long-term prospects? I do.\nIn the medium term, there is ample reason to see growth continue. It might not hit the levels it has in recent quarters, more than tripling revenue year over year , but high double-digit growth is nothing to shake a stick at. Fears over revenue streams drying up, at least anytime soon, are overblown. If you look at the giant tech companies that buy Nvidia's chips, like Meta and Alphabet, their latest-earnings calls show a clear intent to not just continue but to expand spending on AI infrastructure. The gravy train isn't slowing any time soon.\nLook at the massive increase in capital expenditures from Alphabet over the last three years. Notice the sharp upswing in the last year?\nThinking more long term now, the value proposition for Nvidia remains. AI is likely to transform the economy, and Nvidia is firmly placed in the middle of this transformation. Of course, Nividia is beset on all sides by competitors vying for that place, and the company will have to work diligently to stay ahead of the curve. But for my money, if there is a company that can do it, it is Nvidia. It has shown incredible foresight and an ability to innovate and pivot when it sees new opportunities.\nI think investors are likely to see more concrete examples of AI's impact on companies' bottom lines in the next year, and I believe it will renew investors' faith in AI as a whole and Nvidia as its champion.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

But with the stock exceeding a $3 trillion market cap and expectations extremely high, Nvidia sold off anyway following the release.\nOne reasons could be concern over the company's gross margin. Here's what happened with this all-important metric last quarter, and whether investors should be concerned about it.\nAs the AI revolution took off, cloud computing companies and large enterprises clamored for as many of Nvidia's data center GPUs as they could get. The supply-demand mismatch enabled Nvidia to charge a premium for its chips, even as volumes grew. Hence, its gross margin expanded from a range between 55% and 65% \"pre-AI\" to a whopping 78.4% in the company's Q1 this year ending in April, while operating margin expanded from a range between 20% and 40% all the way up to 64.9% in the first quarter.\nBut as you can also see, gross and operating margin took a dip in the recently reported second quarter compared with Q1. Gross margin retreated to 75.1%, a decline of 3.3 percentage points, and operating margin declined to 62.1%. Meanwhile, on the conference call with analysts, CFO Colette Kress forecast gross margin of just 74.4% in the current quarter.\nThat could suggest a cooling of demand or pushback on price from large customers, who may be getting tired of paying through the nose for Nvidia chips. After all, investor concerns over cloud customers' getting a return on all of their AI spending is what led to the pullback in technology stocks this summer.\nIn the release, Nvidia noted that the decline in gross margin was due to \"a higher mix of new products within Data Center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.\"\nThat explanation should let Nvidia shareholders breathe a sigh of relief, at least for now. It has been known that Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip would be pushed back slightly, because of a manufacturing defect discovered late in the manufacturing and sampling process.\nOn the call, Nvidia noted that it made a change to the GPU mask at its foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), in order to improve manufacturing yields. Of note, this appears to be a minor tweak, as CEO Jensen Huang noted no functional changes were necessary to the chip. Still, it appears there were enough defects on the initial sampling ramp-up of Blackwell that Nvidia had to scrap a fair amount of chips from early production at TSMC.\nIt's not clear how much of the decline in gross margin was due to inventory writedowns. But the remaining margin decline was attributed to a \"mix shift to new products.\" This is where things get murky.\nIn chip manufacturing, newer products often take time to ramp up their yields, as the manufacturing process is perfected over time. But is the decline in Nvidia's gross margin due to lower initial yields in manufacturing, or is Nvidia increasingly limited in the premium it can charge for new products?\nMake no mistake: The current workhorse, the H200, is no doubt more expensive than the H100. However, newer products are also more complicated, and therefore expensive, for TSMC to produce.\nSo it's unclear if the remainder of the gross margin decline is due to lower initial yields, which eventually go higher as production ramps up, or if Nvidia, while charging more money for new products, can't maintain the same margin as the sticker price for newer chips go higher and higher.\nAfter all, Nvidia noted that 45% of its revenue comes from cloud service providers, all of whom are now pursuing their own in-house designed AI accelerators to lower costs. In addition, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), which isn't a cloud service provider but also probably accounts for a big chunk of Nvidia's revenue in addition to that 45%, has begun designing its own accelerators as well. And rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) forecasts above $4.5 billion in sales for its MI300 line of AI GPUs, which just came out this year and should keep Nvidia on its toes.\nAll of these companies, however, should continue to buy Nvidia chips. Nvidia still makes the most advanced neutral third-party GPU chip, and with developers already very familiar with its CUDA software, Nvidia should still see strong sales over the next few years.\nBut with all of its major customers now pursuing their own lower-cost self-designed alternatives and more competition incoming, Nvidia will have to compete that much harder. That can either come by staying a step ahead on the hardware side, or cutting prices -- or both.\nTherefore, Nvidia's investors need to keep an eye on gross margin, or perhaps model in some give-back in margin in the years ahead, even as revenue marches higher.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia has been a spectacular investment in recent years. The stock has skyrocketed more than 700% since January 2023 amid excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). But excitement is a double-edged sword. Numerous companies are now designing custom AI chips, and some investors are concerned Nvidia will lose market share.\nThe following hedge fund billionaires have navigated the situation by selling shares of Nvidia in the second quarter, and redeploying capital into the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ), a growth-focused index fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 index.\nCliff Asness at AQR Capital sold 1.3 million shares of Nvidia, shrinking his stake by 8%. He also bought 9,254 shares of the Invesco QQQ Trust, increasing his position 332%.\nSteven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management sold 409,042 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 16%. He also bought 1,500 shares of the Invesco QQQ Trust, increasing his position 150%.\nIsrael Englander at Millennium Management sold 676,242 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake 5%. He also bought 81,616 shares of the Invesco QQQ Trust, increasing his position by 557%.\nKen Griffin at Citadel Advisors sold 9.2 million shares of Nvidia, slashing his stake 79%. He also purchased 2.8 million shares of the Invesco QQQ Trust, increasing his position by 585%.\nDavid Shaw at D.E. Shaw sold 12.1 million shares of Nvidia, cutting his stake 52%. He also started a small position in the Invesco QQQ Trust.\nImportantly, these trades do not signal a complete lack of confidence in Nvidia. Not only do all five fund managers still have positions in the chipmaker, but also Nvidia is the third largest position in the Invesco QQQ Trust.\nHaving said that, their decision to buy the index fund is sensible because it diversifies their portfolios across more technology stocks likely to benefit from the AI boom. Here's what investors should know about the Invesco QQQ Trust.\nThe Invesco QQQ Trust measures the performance of the Nasdaq-100, an index that tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. The index fund is heavily weighted toward the information technology sector. The 10 largest holdings are listed by weight:\nApple: 8.9%\nMicrosoft: 8.3%\nNvidia: 7.7%\nBroadcom: 5.1%\nAmazon: 5.1%\nMeta Platforms: 4.8%\nAlphabet: 4.6%\nTesla: 2.9%\nCostco Wholesale: 2.7%\nNetflix: 2%\nMany investors see Nvidia as a paragon of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks because the company dominates the market for data center graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that are the gold standard in speeding up complex workloads such as training machine learning models. But several other companies in that list are well positioned to monetize AI.\nFor instance, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have the three largest public clouds in the world. That means they should be major beneficiaries as businesses invest in the cloud infrastructure and platform services required to train AI models and develop AI applications.\nSimilarly, Broadcom helps customers like Alphabet and Meta Platforms design custom AI chips, and it recently won a major deal with OpenAI. That bodes well for the company because Morgan Stanley analysts expect the custom AI chip market to grow more quickly than the GPU market through the end of the decade.\nFinally, Tesla is dedicated to developing full self-driving (FSD) software, and the company plans to monetize its FSD platform through subscription sales and robotaxi services.\nThe Invesco QQQ Trust has been an excellent long-term investment. The index fund returned 1,490% over the past 20 years, compounding at 14.8% annually. By comparison, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) returned 641% during the same period, compounding at 10.5% annually.\nThe downside of the Invesco QQQ Trust is volatility. The fund is highly concentrated in technology stocks, such that weakness in that market sector can cause it to nosedive. The Invesco QQQ Trust has a 10-year beta of 1.12, meaning it moved 1.12 percentage points for every 1-percentage-point movement in the S&P 500.\nVolatility cuts both ways. On one hand, the Invesco QQQ Trust more than doubled the return of the S&P 500 during the past two decades. On the other hand, the Invesco QQQ Trust declined much more sharply than the S&P 500 during the most recent bear market. Specifically, the index fund suffered a maximum drawdown of 35%, while the S&P 500 never fell more than 24%.\nThe last item of note is the expense ratio. The Invesco QQQ Trust has an expense ratio of 0.2%, meaning investors will pay $2 per year on every $1,000 invested in the index fund. That's below the industry average of 0.36%, according to Morningstar.\nHere is the bottom line: The Invesco QQQ Trust is a growth-focused index fund that tracks several companies well positioned to benefit from the artificial intelligence boom, including Nvidia. The index fund's concentration in technology stocks makes it volatile, but that volatility has been an asset over the past two decades, given its outperformance compared to the S&P 500.\nI think the Invesco QQQ Trust will continue to outperform over the next decade as the AI boom unfolds. Patient investors comfortable with risk and volatility should consider buying a small position today. And shareholders should lean into market weakness by adding to their position during significant pullbacks.\nBefore you buy stock in Invesco QQQ Trust, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Invesco QQQ Trust wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) A Strong Investment Prospect According to Jim Cramer?",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Must-See: Jim Cramer\u2019s 10 Best Stock Picks for Investors Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other Jim Cramer's best stocks for investors.\nIn a recent episode of\u00a0Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed how the slowing economy might lead the Federal Reserve to ease its policies. He expects the Fed to cut interest rates, but it\u2019s unclear whether the reduction will be 25 or 50 basis points. This decision is crucial as it could significantly impact the market.\n\u201cAt last, the economy has slowed enough that the Fed can take its foot off the brakes and step on the gas. That\u2019s why we\u2019re starting our game plan in the middle of next week when the Federal Reserve renders its verdict: 25 or 50 basis points. We don\u2019t typically have a lot of drama in this business, but this one counts as a nail-biter because we really don\u2019t know how big the rate cut will be. We just know they\u2019re going to cut.\u201d\nCramer pointed out that Friday\u2019s market performance was strong, with the Dow gaining 297 points, the S&P rising by 0.54%, and the Nasdaq increasing by 0.65%. This marked the best two weeks of the year for the S&P and the Nasdaq, suggesting that the market might be anticipating a larger rate cut of 50 basis points. Stocks sensitive to interest rates, particularly in housing, surged in response.\n\u201cToday\u2019s rally saw the Dow gaining 297 points, the S&P advancing 0.54%, and the Nasdaq climbing 0.65%, capping off the best two weeks of the year for both the latter two indices. The S&P and the Nasdaq suggest the Fed might actually go for 50. That\u2019s a double rate cut. I know this because the stocks most sensitive to interest rates, particularly housing and housing-related names, soared today.\u201d\nCramer also cautioned that if the housing market rally continues, it could lead to a sell-off if only a 25 basis point cut is announced. He pointed out that traders are currently pricing in a higher chance of a 50 basis point cut, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool. If the Fed opts for a smaller cut, traders who bought in anticipation of a larger reduction might sell off their stocks, potentially causing market volatility.\n\u201cTo use a little NFL fantasy football lingo, they soared presumably in anticipation of something huge from Jay Powell and company. All aboard! I still find myself betting on a quarter-point cut, though. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t need a half-point cut, as the economy is slowing pretty quickly, especially for the lower-income cohort. However, I\u2019ve always believed that the Fed should be measured when it cuts rates at this stage of the business cycle.\nJim Cramer warned that if the housing market rally keeps going, it might lead to a sell-off if the Federal Reserve announces only a 25 basis point rate cut. If the Fed delivers a smaller cut, traders who anticipated a bigger reduction might start selling their stocks, which could lead to increased market volatility.\n\u201cNow, if the housing rally continues at this pace, these stocks run the risk of being too hot to handle for a mere 25 basis point cut, and we\u2019ll get a sell-off in response. Keep in mind how the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool, which tracks interest rate expectations based on the Fed Funds Futures Market, indicates that traders are now pricing in a much higher probability of a double rate cut, currently at 45%. That\u2019s much higher than it was a week ago. These traders could indeed be disappointed if the Fed decides to be more measured. They could be your enemy come Wednesday at 2 p.m. as they dump what they bought incorrectly, and that is what happens. That\u2019s what traders do, they let the stocks go.\u201d\nFinally, Jim Cramer believes that this week is critical for the market. He advised that if the market declines after a 25 basis point cut, investors should remember the strong performance of the past week. This week\u2019s gains could be a sign of more positive developments as the Federal Reserve continues to ease its monetary policy.\n\u201cWhen I look at next week, I can only conclude that we\u2019re finally at the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for. So let me give you the bottom line: if we sell off on a 25 basis point rate cut, remember this phenomenal week, because there will be plenty more like it as the easing process continues and progresses.\u201d\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nJim Cramer noted that Wall Street is expected to build on Wednesday\u2019s strong performance, following a midday reversal. On the previous day, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang boosted the market by highlighting high demand for Nvidia\u2019s AI chips and promoting the company\u2019s bright outlook. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a long-standing member of the Investing Club\u2019s portfolio, will be a topic of discussion at the September Monthly Meeting, starting at noon ET.\nAt a Goldman Sachs conference, Huang described the demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s upcoming Blackwell chip platform as extremely high, with many eager to be the first to get it. This led to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s shares rising 8% during the session.\n\u201cWall Street on Thursday is on track to extend Wednesday\u2019s robust gains following an intraday reversal. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ignited the market in the prior session after talking up demand for its AI chips and touting the company\u2019s bright future. We\u2019ll discuss Nvidia, a longtime Club holding, and the rest of our Investing Club portfolio at our September Monthly Meeting, which kicks off at noon ET.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a strong investment prospect due to its leadership in AI and GPU markets, rapid revenue growth, and advancements in computing technology. In its latest earnings report, NVIDIA projected over 107% year-over-year revenue growth, potentially reaching $28.6 billion in fiscal Q2 2024. Analysts are bullish on the stock, with firms like Evercore ISI and Wedbush forecasting a potential 20% increase in its price.\nNVIDIA\u2019s dominant market share of 70-80% in AI chips, along with its growing footprint in cloud gaming and data centers, positions it for sustained growth. With an expected annual growth rate of 38% over the next five years, the company\u2019s revenue could climb to $108 billion by 2026. This growth is largely driven by its leadership in AI hardware, a market expected to expand to $300 billion annually by 2027. The combination of market dominance and strong future demand makes NVIDIA a highly attractive investment.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's 10 best stocks for investors. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Reveals 12 Stocks Investors Should Monitor Closely.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed the current state of the economy, noting that there are essentially two separate economies at play. One economy is struggling with higher interest rates, making it harder for businesses and individuals to thrive, while the other seems unaffected by these rates. This division explains why, even after a double rate cut, the stock market, including the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq, still experienced declines.\n\"There really are two economies in this country. There's one that needs lower interest rates because business is slowing and it's harder to find a job, and then there's another that says we don't really care about where the rates are. That's how we can get a double rate cut today and still see the Dow dipping 103 points, the S&P declining 29 points, and the Nasdaq shedding 31 points.\"\nJim Cramer highlights that many companies, especially retailers and restaurants serving low-income customers, are worried about high interest rates and needed the recent double rate cut to improve their forecasts. While this cut benefits the housing and industrial sectors, which initially rose in stock prices before selling off, the tech sector in Silicon Valley remains largely unaffected. Cramer describes tech leaders as having escaped the constraints of interest rates, focusing on innovation and catering to businesses rather than consumers. Their success relies more on their ability to innovate than on interest rate fluctuations.\n\"There are so many companies I talk to that truly worry about the economy and say they can't make their forecasts because rates are too high. We've been hearing that from most retailers and restaurants, especially those that cater to the less well-off. They needed this double rate cut\u2014believe me. It's great for housing, and it can help the industrials; those stocks ran in anticipation and sold off when we got what we wanted. That is a very typical action.\nAdditionally, he explains that tech companies are not selling everyday goods like homes, washing machines, or cars. Unlike housing, which relies on lower mortgage rates to boost sales, the tech sector focuses on creating software that simplifies the home-buying process. While lower rates can encourage new businesses, many startups are too small to need extensive software solutions.\n\"You see, these tech companies aren't selling homes; they aren't selling washing machines or cars or steel or plastic\u2014things worth less than a dollar that are sold for more than a dollar at a dollar store. Housing, of course, needs lower mortgage rates to get sales going. Tech doesn't care about mortgage rates; they just want to create software that reduces some of the friction you encounter in the process of buying a home. Lower rates make it more likely that people start new companies, but most new companies are too small to need major enterprise software. Companies we talk to can see small-cap companies go up, but big enterprise software? Not so much.\"\nCramer notes that the Federal Reserve cut rates to help control inflation, which benefits more businesses overall. However, in the tech industry, the focus is on increasing efficiency through automation, often resulting in fewer employees. These tech companies aim to avoid being affected by the Fed's decisions because relying on them would indicate weakness and vulnerability to the economic cycle, which they actively seek to evade.\n\"The Fed wanted to be sure that inflation is contained and going in the right direction, which then allowed them to relent and cut by 50 basis points. Now, more businesses in the East can thrive, but out here, the presumption is that all enterprises are trying to raise margins, often by automating everything that can be automated, which means using fewer people. These tech companies are automators; they never want to be hostage to the Fed. They don't want you to be hostage to the Fed because that would be a sign of weakness\u2014a sign of cyclicality. Oh, they hate cyclicality. Why be hostage to the business cycle if you don't have to?\"\nFinally, Jim Cramer emphasizes that many people see artificial intelligence as a key player in today's market. Companies that leverage AI can improve their profit margins, which boosts earnings even if their overall sales are declining. This means that even without increasing sales, AI can help businesses become more profitable.\nOur Methodology\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Morning Thoughts, in which he analyzed several stocks. We selected 12 companies and ranked them by their ownership levels among hedge funds, beginning with those that are least owned and moving to those that are most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

This reflects growing confidence in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s market position and potential for future growth.\n\"William Blair also initiated Nvidia with a buy, noting tremendous demand for its products.\"\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s strong outlook is supported by impressive Q2 2024 earnings, with revenue reaching $13.5 billion, a 50% increase from last year, and a net income of $5.6 billion. This growth is driven by high demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) in gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\nAs a leader in the AI field, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s GPUs are essential for training machine learning models and powering AI solutions, positioning the company for continued growth as investment in AI infrastructure rises. The surge in data center revenue, particularly from cloud service providers, highlights NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s commitment to high-performance computing solutions.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s innovative product lineup, including the H100 Tensor Core GPU designed for AI workloads, allows it to take advantage of rapid technological advancements. Strategic partnerships with major tech companies like Microsoft and Google further enhance NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s ecosystem and promote wider adoption of its products.\nWith strong brand recognition and a solid market share in the GPU market, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to benefit from growth in gaming, AI, and data centers. Recent announcements of AI-related product enhancements and an optimistic revenue outlook suggest sustained demand, reinforcing NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s potential for significant future growth.\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer.

        "Text": "Nvidia\u2019s CEO won\u2019t give up on you, which at first might sound nice. But the other foot has seemingly dropped on Nvidia\u2019s employees who are working round the clock because of just how much their executive claims to believe in them.\nHuang, the CEO of Nvidia, has recently become a giant in the tech world as his AI chip design company soared to a $3 trillion valuation in June. He doesn\u2019t necessarily usher in a different way of working, though: In a fireside chat with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, Huang praised the value of pushing employees to the brink.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather torture you into greatness because I believe in you,\u201d Huang said. While he said he was being \"tongue-in-cheek,\" he added, \u201cI think coaches that really believe in their team torture them into greatness.\u201d\nWhen you fire someone, there\u2019s the notion that they can\u2019t learn the job at hand, explained Huang\u2014but he doesn\u2019t really subscribe to that mentality. \u201cI don't like giving up on people because I think they could improve,\u201d he said.\nRather than avoiding putting all his eggs in one basket, Huang strays closer to breaking them. Indeed, accounts of a grueling workplace at Nvidia have recently cropped up. Anonymous interviews from a group of 10 current and former staff members paint a picture of an always-on culture, per Bloomberg.\nOne such former employee spoke of seven-day workweeks and days that end around 1 or 2 a.m. They noted other staff members would sign off at even later hours. The reported \u201cpressure cooker\u201d has led to some tension at the office. Another former worker said she attended seven to 10 daily meetings, where fighting and shouting were common.\nThis workaholic norm is perhaps coming from the top down. When asked in the same fireside talk about his work-life balance, Huang said the following: \u201cIt's really great. I work as much as I can,\u201d adding that he works from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed. Huang is always thinking about work, and don\u2019t ask him how he liked the most recent film he watched, because while he might sit there he doesn\u2019t \u201cremember them because I'm thinking about work.\u201d\nIt all leads to a situation not unlike being inside with no recess on an exceptionally nice day. Nvidia workers have a pretty sweet deal when it comes to compensation, as they can contribute up to 15% of their salary to buying company shares at a 15% discount. But because of their long hours, there\u2019s not much of a playground to enjoy their riches with.\nOne former employee described it as being like being tied to \u201cgolden handcuffs,\u201d explaining that she didn't leave for two years because of her wealth-building opportunities. For sure, many workers likely don\u2019t quit because of their vested shares and the potential stock grants vested every four years. Turnover sat at 2.7% in 2023 compared to the general rate of 17.7% in the semiconductor industry, according to Nvidia\u2019s Sustainability Report for 2024\u2019s fiscal year.\nPart of Huang\u2019s asserted ethos is that he doesn\u2019t want his workers to miss out on their potential. \u201cOftentimes they're so close,\u201d he noted. \u201cCould you imagine you gave up just that moment right before you got it? I don't want you to give up on that, so I'll just keep torturing you.\u201d\nNvidia declined Fortune's request for comment.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead of Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stock no doubt has been Nvidia, whose graphic processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of the AI infrastructure buildout. However, with spending in the space still frantic as companies rush to compete, Nvidia won't be the only winner.\nWhile Nvidia has been a great stock, I want to highlight two more companies that have a lot of potential upside from the AI boon.\nWhile Nvidia is the leader in mass market GPUs, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is looking to be the leader in customized AI chips. These are application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, that are designed specifically for a customer's precise needs. These chips are created to run specific AI workloads, and as such are more efficient than general GPUs.\nBroadcom's first customer in the space was Alphabet, for which it helped design and provide key technologies for its tensor-processing units (TPUs). These TPUs are now used for both AI training and inference. Alphabet claims that what separates its TPUs from GPUs is that they carry several specialized features, including a matrix multiply unit (MXU) and proprietary interconnect topology that make them ideal for accelerating AI training and inference.\nThe company has announced that it has added more large AI chip customers this year, which are believed to be Meta Platforms and China's ByteDance, owner of TikTok. ByteDance needs AI chips that are compliant with U.S. export restrictions as Nvidia's most advanced GPUs are not permitted to be shipped to China. Meta, meanwhile, values its strategic relationship with Broadcom so much so that the company added its CEO to its board of directors earlier this year.\nThere are also multiple reports that OpenAI is set to become Broadcom's fourth big AI chip customer as it has been in discussions with the company to design its own chips. There have also been rumors that the company has secured a fifth AI ASIC customer with a planned ramp up in 2026.\nCustom AI chips are a large and growing market, which has helped Broadcom continue to ramp up its AI revenue forecasts, which started the year at $7.5 billion but are now sitting at $12 billion. With the addition of new customers, this is a huge opportunity for the company over the next several years.\nBroadcom is also benefiting from providing networking components used in the buildout of AI data-center infrastructure. The company believes its ethernet switches will be at the heart of handling AI workloads and transferring data between GPUs, and that as GPU clusters get larger, the importance of switching becomes more important.\nBroadcom has a huge AI opportunity in front of it, while the stock is attractively priced trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 28 based on next year's analyst estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.75. Generally, a stock with a PEG under 1 is considered undervalued, and growth stocks often command PEG ratios much higher than 1.\nGiven its valuation and growth prospects, Broadcom's stock looks like it could be the next big AI winner.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC for short, is the largest semiconductor contract manufacturer in the world, and as such it plays a vital role in the chipmaking process. It manufactures chips for most of the top semiconductor companies, including Nvidia and Broadcom, while Apple, which designs its own chips for use in its devices, is its largest customer.\nAs such, the the company is benefiting from the proliferation of chips needed for both the AI infrastructure buildout and any hardware upgrade cycle that may accompany it for smartphones and other devices. By and large, it doesn't matter who is winning the AI chip race, as most of the big players are its customers.\nGiven the insatiable need for chips, not surprisingly TSMC's services are in high demand, and the company is working to increase capacity to meet this increasing demand. Meanwhile, thus far there is no indication that demand is waning as major tech companies continue to ramp up their AI infrastructure investments and more and more compute power is needed as large language models (LLMs) become more advanced.\nWith demand so high for AI chips, capacity at TSMC's foundries (chip manufacturing facilities) is tight, which is also giving the company a lot of pricing power. According to Morgan Stanley, the company is set to raise prices by 10% for AI semiconductors and chip-on-wafer-on-substrate products, by 6% for high-performance computing, and by 3% for smartphones.\nThe combination of increasing capacity to meet demand and strong pricing power sets up TSMC to be one of the biggest AI beneficiaries over the next several years. Meanwhile, the stock is relatively inexpensive trading at a forward P/E ratio of about 21 based on next year's analyst estimates and a PEG ratio of just over 1. Given its robust outlook, the stock looks like a solid buy at current levels.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jennifer Sor ",
        "Text": "Nvidia stock has a lot more room to run, according to Dan Niles.\nThe Niles Investment founder compared Nvidia to Cisco prior to the peak of the dot-com bubble.\nNvidia shares could double in the next couple of years, he predicted.\nNvidia stock has slid since the company reported earnings last month, but its rally is nowhere close to over.\nThat's according to Dan Niles, founder and portfolio manager of Niles Investment Management, who's still bullish on the artificial intelligence titan for the foreseeable future.\nThat's because firms are still willing to shell out on AI spending \u2014 and Nvidia looks like it's following the same pattern as other firms that soared during past tech bubbles, he told CNBC in a recent interview.\n\"I still believe you have a lot of room for spend,\" Niles said of AI. \"What I'm saying is that in the short term, I think you've got a digestion phase that you just have to go through. I firmly believe that in the next several years, Nvidia's revenues will again be able to double from current levels, and the stock will be able to double as well.\"\nCisco, which dominated the internet bubble in the late nineties, saw its revenue peak at around 15 times what it posted in 1994, while its stock had soared nearly 4,000% from that year through 2000. It plunged during the dot-com crash, with shares plummeting around 85% peak-to-trough.\nNvidia shares, by comparison, have risen around 1,500% over the last six years. Niles suggested that this could mean the chipmaker has more upside ahead before a fallout.\n\"I've lived through '01, '02. These things can go on longer than you've ever imagined possible,\" he added.\nIn the short term, Niles' forecast is at the high end among analysts watching Nvidia. But most of Wall Street remains optimistic about the chipmaker in the quarters ahead, especially as the company looks poised to roll out its next-gen Blackwell AI chip.\nAnalysts have an average price target of $153.24 a share, according to Nasdaq data, implying another 44% upside from its current levels.\nThe chipmaker has hit a rough stretch in recent weeks, with shares dropping 27% from their peak earlier this summer.\nInvestors have been dismayed by the delay of the Blackwell chip, but more importantly, many are also questioning whether all of the billions of AI spending by Nvidia's customers will end up generating a return anytime soon.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the market's most visible and influential battleground stock. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader posted second-quarter results after the market closed on Aug. 28 and posted performance that crushed Wall Street's targets. The business recorded non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $0.68 on sales of $30 billion in the period, cruising past the average analyst estimate for per-share earnings of $0.64 on revenue of $28.7 billion.\nBut despite substantial sales and earnings beats in the quarter, Nvidia stock still lost ground following the report. With the company's share price losing ground on the heels of a blockbuster Q2 report, it's not unreasonable to wonder whether the red-hot AI leader may have finally hit its valuation peak.\nWhile the stock could continue to see some post-earnings valuation volatility, there's a good reason to think the stock can bounce back and continue climbing higher.\nThanks to AI-driven demand for the company's most advanced processors, Nvidia has been posting fantastic gross margins. The chart below tracks the business' gross margin over a three-year period concluding at the first quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year, which ended April 28, 2024.\nWith its recent report, Nvidia showed that it had recorded a gross margin of 75.1% in Q2 and also guided for a margin of 74.4% in fiscal Q3. For the full-year period, the company expects its gross margin percentage to be in the mid-70s. Based on the company's recent results and forecast, it looks like prices for its AI processors are coming down -- but not by much.\nNvidia's current top-of-the-line graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerators are still showing very strong pricing power, and large tech companies are still buying hardware to improve their AI infrastructure. Selling prices for the company's current GPUs for advanced data center applications will likely continue to decline, but the AI frontrunner is gearing up to release its next major chip platform.\nNvidia has said that manufacturing of its next-generation Blackwell chips will ramp up in the fourth quarter, and it appears that the new processors are poised for release late in 2024 or early in 2025. With the company's current processors demonstrating resilient pricing power and a major leap forward in GPU technology on the horizon, the bull case for the stock remains intact.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Robert Izquierdo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) propelled shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) to incredible gains over the past year, from a 52-week low of $39.23 in 2023 to a high of $140.76 on June 20. This prompted a 10-for-1 stock split, and a 150% increase in its dividend in 2024.\nNow, after several consecutive quarters of impressive sales, Wall Street's expectations of the semiconductor giant are quite high. That seems to have contributed to a drop in Nvidia's stock after it reported earnings on Aug. 28.\nDoes the recent decline in Nvidia's share price create a buy opportunity? Or did the company's latest earnings report signal warning signs? To answer these questions, here's a look into where the company is at now.\nFor starters, let's unpack the results from its fiscal second quarter, ended July 28. The company experienced a 122% year-over-year rise in Q2 sales to hit a record $30 billion.\nThis triple-digit revenue growth was no small feat given what it accomplished in 2023's fiscal Q2. At that time, Nvidia achieved a 101% year-over-year sales increase as generative AI began to take off.\nFollowing 2023's Q2 performance with another triple-digit year-over-year increase illustrates the insatiable customer demand that exists for Nvidia's products. It's a key reason behind the company's investment appeal.\nCEO Jensen Huang, describing what's currently driving this, stated, \"Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.\" Hopper is the name of Nvidia's platform for the current generation of graphics processing units (GPUs) specifically designed for AI.\nThe company expects Hopper GPU shipments to increase in the second half of its 2025 fiscal year. Blackwell is the next generation GPU platform, scheduled for a production ramp up in Nvidia's fiscal Q4, and continuing into fiscal 2026.\nBoth the Hopper and Blackwell GPUs won accolades recently for industry-leading performance related to AI inference. Inference measures an AI's ability to correctly make decisions and execute tasks. These results demonstrate why Nvidia products are in such high demand.\nAs a result of the customer demand the company is experiencing, Nvidia estimated its fiscal Q3 revenue to reach around $32.5 billion. That represents nearly an 80% jump up from the prior year's $18.1 billion.\nYet since Q3's projected sales isn't as dramatic a year-over-year increase as Q2, some on Wall Street took it as a sign of slowing growth, contributing to Nvidia's share price drop.\nMoreover, Huang previously indicated Blackwell production would ramp up in fiscal Q3, so the delay to Q4 affected Q3 sales estimates.\nHowever, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is a \"buy\" rating with a median price target of $147.80 for Nvidia stock. As this target reveals, Wall Street believes there's still good upside for shares, especially after the recent price drop.\nI agree with the Wall Street consensus that Nvidia stock is a buy. Looking at the company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), a widely used metric to assess stock valuation, Nvidia looks undervalued compared to major competitors AMD and Intel.\nContributing to this is Nvidia's growth in diluted earnings per share (EPS). In Q2, EPS reached $0.67, an impressive 168% year-over-year increase. In addition, the company more than doubled its fiscal Q2 free cash flow (FCF) to $13.5 billion from $6.1 billion in 2023.\nAnother positive factor in Nvidia's Q2 results is the year-over-year sales growth across all of its lines of business, including its gaming division. Gaming revenue was up 16% year over year to $2.9 billion.\nThis is significant because rival AMD's Q2 gaming sales plunged a whopping 59% year over year to $648 million. As its results demonstrate, Nvidia is able to maintain strong demand, even in markets where competitors struggle.\nThis strength lends credence to estimates that Nvidia commands in the neighborhood of 70% to 95% of the GPU market for AI. And with the AI industry forecast to grow from $136 billion last year to $826 billion by 2030, the long-term investor has many years of industry growth to reap the rewards of owning Nvidia stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Ultimate Stock Picks: 10 Hot Stocks to Consider. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among Jim Cramer's 10 hot stocks to consider.\nIn a recent episode of\u00a0Mad Money, Jim Cramer emphasized the unexpected strength in the market, pointing out that many companies are doing better than Wall Street realizes. He suggests that investors should stop second-guessing these companies every time negative news surfaces. Cramer praises the excellent management and execution by CEOs, which he feels often goes unappreciated.\n\u201cSuddenly, all is forgiven, or if not all, then at least most. I\u2019m talking about the incredible resilience in this market, buoyed by a recognition that many companies are simply better than Wall Street gives them credit for. We need to stop turning against them every time there\u2019s a seemingly bad data point. Every day I come to work, I\u2019m dazzled by the resourcefulness of executives who do their best to create value for you, the shareholder. Lots of stocks went up on days like today when the Dow advanced 335 points, the S&P gained 75%, and the NASDAQ jumped 1.0%, all thanks to good management and excellent execution that often goes unnoticed.\u201d\nJim Cramer acknowledges that while some CEOs might warrant skepticism, many are truly exceptional and deserve more recognition for their efforts. He criticizes the overemphasis on short-term economic indicators, arguing that great companies stay focused and aren\u2019t thrown off by minor fluctuations.\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m not a pushover. I can hit CEOs with tough questions when needed, some of them deserve skepticism and scorn. But there are also plenty of brilliant, hardworking CEOs with incredible teams, and you ignore their hustle at your own peril. This often gets lost in the shuffle when we\u2019re focused on the parlor game of guessing the Fed\u2019s next move, a quarter point, half a point, quarter, half. You know what I say? Let\u2019s get serious. Terrific companies don\u2019t get caught up in that quarter-half shuffle.\u201d\nCramer highlights Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen as an example of strong leadership. Despite facing challenges like opposition to its acquisition of Albertsons and a tough economic climate, McMullen has successfully managed to keep food costs down. Through strategies such as an effective loyalty program and improvements to regional stores, the company has performed well. After a strong earnings report, the stock rose more than 7%, reflecting a successful turnaround.\n\u201cCEO Rodney McMullen has managed to keep food costs down and deliver fantastic numbers, all while maintaining an expensive, unionized labor force in a very uncertain commodity environment. How? The company confounded critics by developing a superior loyalty program, regionalizing their stores, and creating some of the best private-label products out there, second only to Costco. Food is still expensive, but cooking at home is far cheaper than dining out. McMullen tells us that consumers are no longer flush with cash, especially his most budget-conscious clientele. He notes, \u201cBudget-conscious customers are buying more at the beginning of the month to stock up on essentials, and as the month progresses, they become more cautious with their spending.\u201d\nIn contrast, Cramer points out that the tech industry often suffers from misunderstandings due to its complex nature. He believes that Wall Street analysts frequently fail to appreciate the expertise and potential of tech CEOs who have a deep grasp of their businesses.\n\u201cWe all need to eat, so it\u2019s not hard to understand the grocery business. But it\u2019s quite different when it comes to tech, where analysts constantly doubt the resolve and expertise of CEOs who simply know more about their businesses than the critics. In tech, the complexity often leads Wall Street to conclusions that have little to do with reality.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nThis article reviews a recent edition of Jim Cramer\u2019s Morning Thoughts, where he covered different stocks. We have selected and analyzed the ten most notable companies mentioned, ranking them according to how much they are owned by hedge funds, from the least owned to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Huang was there, along with other tech leaders and representatives from power and utility companies, to discuss the future of AI energy infrastructure in the US.\n\u201cClub holding\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell chip platform is starting \u201cfull volume production,\u201d CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC\u2019s own Megan Cassella on Thursday outside the White House. Jensen, other tech executives, and leaders of power and utility companies were there for a meeting about the future of AI energy infrastructure in the U.S.\u201d\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s strong investment outlook is based on its leading position in AI and GPU markets, impressive revenue growth, and advancements in parallel computing. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s latest earnings report predicts a revenue increase of over 107% year-over-year, potentially reaching around $28.6 billion in fiscal Q2 2024. Analysts are optimistic, with firms like Evercore ISI and Wedbush projecting more than 20% upside in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s stock price.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s dominant 70-80% share of the AI chip market, along with its growing presence in cloud gaming and data centers, sets it up for continued success. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to achieve a 38% annual growth rate over the next five years, with revenue possibly reaching $108 billion by 2026. This growth is driven by its leadership in AI hardware, a sector anticipated to reach a $300 billion annual market by 2027.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's ultimate stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Rather, government officials say they are providing \u201cguidance\u201d to local companies and encouraging the purchase of Chinese made products.\nThe renewed focus on buying Chinese microchips and semiconductors comes amid escalating tensions with the U.S. over the technology. The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has imposed export controls on microchips and processors to China, citing concerns that the technology will be used to further develop the country\u2019s military capabilities.\nChina has accounted for 25% of Nvidia\u2019s annual revenues in the past. In recent months, the chipmaker had found ways to continue selling its high-end microchips to Chinese companies without violating American export controls. Essentially, Nvidia is selling chips to China that are based on its popular H100 microchip but that have 50% less computing power.\nNvidia\u2019s stock has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 42 Wall Street analysts.

Please take our money. By the way, I got dinner. No, no, take more of it. We need you to take more of our money please.\u201d\nThe outcome was a net positive, said Ellison. \u201cIt went ok. I mean, it worked.\u201d\nEllison, whose famed fortune is estimated to be $206 billion, is a prominent figure in the tech industry and serves as executive chairman of enterprise software firm Oracle. He is known for anticipating significant technological shifts, including accurately positioning the $475 billion tech giant to reap the benefits of the internet in its early days. He has further solidified the company by shifting it to capitalize on the surging need for cloud-based enterprise infrastructure. The company has maintained a strong relationship with Nvidia, which controls more than 80% of the AI chip market, and is the prime choice for companies working on AI.\nAt last week\u2019s meeting Ellison said the competitive landscape won\u2019t hinder Oracle\u2019s growth. The simplest way of looking at it, Ellison replied, is the phrase,\u201cthe race goes on.\u201d He likened the current competition in AI to a Formula One driving race.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got three people on the podium, but there\u2019s really kind of one winner,\u201d said Ellison. \u201cSomeone is going to be better at this than anyone else, and multiple people are trying and there is a race.\u201d\nFor its part, Oracle is making gargantuan investments in GPU technology, particularly for AI applications. The tech giant this month announced its first quarter results for fiscal 2025 and disclosed revenues were up 7% to $13.3 billion, year-over-year. Profits were $2.9 billion. Oracle also disclosed that it has 162 cloud datacenters in operation or under construction around the world and the largest of its datacenters is 800 megawatts and will house \u201cacres of Nvidia GPU clusters\u201d used to train large-scale AI models. In the first quarter, Oracle signed 42 more cloud GPU contracts, totaling $3 billion.\nSimilarly, Tesla, where Musk serves as CEO, relies on Nvidia GPUs to power the supercomputers that train its neural networks for self-driving and assisted driving technology.\nAccording to Ellison, being the first to build the most capable neural network in the world \u201cis a big deal.\u201d Given the desire to be at the forefront, many executives in AI are begging Huang for GPUs and building datacenters, he said.\n\u201cDoes anyone know what it costs to build a frontier model over the next three years?\u201d Ellison was referring to the most advanced, bleeding-edge AI systems.\n\u201cOne hundred billion,\u201d said Ellison. \u201cThat\u2019s going to get you in the game.\u201d\n\u201cNot a lot of people and not a lot of companies and not a lot of countries will participate.\u201d\nAn Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment and Tesla did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Investing.com -- Morgan Stanley analysts provided their view on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GB200 server rack production, noting that recent supply chain checks suggest no further delays in shipments.\nConcerns had arisen in the market regarding Nvidia's Blackwell platform, specifically about supply and demand uncertainties, but the production process appears to be on track, according to the investment bank.\n\"Our latest supply chain checks suggest no further delay for GB200 server rack shipments,\" Morgan Stanley states.\nThey also noted that no leakage problems have been spotted, and cable connection issues can be resolved through manufacturing adjustments. Production rollout is scheduled for November 2024, with the first batch of shipments expected by the end of the year.\nThe bank highlights that while both NVL36 and NVL72 designs should hit the market by late 2024, \"NVL72 should be the customer preference for high computing power density and better cost-effectiveness in the long term.\"\nMoreover, Morgan Stanley says some tier-one server buyers will have access to the Blackwell platform around the year-end, while broader shipments to the rest of the market are likely to begin by the end of the first quarter in 2025.\nThey explain that due to the immense power consumption of GB200 server racks, however, most enterprise buyers may prefer HGX/MGX servers for the Blackwell platform.\nMorgan Stanley's analysis suggests that Nvidia's supply chain remains strong, with growth expected in high-speed switches and large-scale 800G switch shipments projected for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\"We see the supply chain continuing to progress to mass production toward year-end,\" writes Morgan Stanley.\nWhile volatility may persist in the short term, the bank remains optimistic, particularly on companies like Wistron, Accton, and Hon Hai for their relationships with Nvidia and contributions to the AI hardware supply chain.\nRelated Articles\nNvidia: Morgan Stanley checks suggest no further GB200 server rack shipment delay\nUS East Coast dockworkers strike, halting half the nation's ocean shipping\nCVC-backed Moove Lubricants targets up to $1.9 billion valuation in US IPO\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Stocks That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks.\nFINRA Investor Education Foundation and CFA Institute (2023) revealed that ~37% of Gen-Z investors in the US and ~38% in the UK come to social media influencers regarding investment decisions. Therefore, it is important to explore the role finfluencers (influencers sharing financial advice on social media) play in providing investment information and how Gen-Z investors engage with finfluencers. Young investors are considering memes and viral videos as the primary source of investment advice.\nExperts believe that retail or non-professional investors are now becoming dependent on digital channels, like social media platforms such as TikTok, when it comes to investing.\nFINRA revealed that ~60% of US investors under age 35 believe that social media can be used as a source of investment information. This compares to ~57% who use finance professionals. This increase is probably because digital channels are becoming easily accessible, with\u00a0~60%\u00a0of the global population utilizing social media (as per DataReportal).\nQuick-scroll websites are now considered the go-to spot for investment ideas and inspiration. This is because of their bite-sized format and easy access. Ofcom, which tracks news consumption in the UK \u2013 revealed that TikTok\u2019s reach for news went up from ~1% in 2020 to ~7% in 2022. This was mainly seen in younger folks aged between 16 \u2013 24 years. Pew Research mentioned that, in the US, this increased from ~3% in 2020 to ~10% in 2022.\nFinancial advice content, which is shared on social media, has been contributing to the growth of the \u201ccreator economy,\u201d which is pegged at ~$127 billion globally (as per Coherent Market Insights). This is expected to reach\u00a0US$528.39 billion\u00a0by 2030, with growth stemming from higher demand for user-generated content and increased monetization opportunities. Financial institutions and investment advisory companies are now focusing on creating pathways from social media to their product and services to exploit strong market opportunities. Therefore, most retail investors continue to make investing decisions under social media\u2019s influence.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. highlighted that non-professional investors\u00a0are now making a bigger part of the US\u00a0options market as they continue to pour money mainly into\u00a0short-term bets\u00a0and technology stocks. The bank highlighted that retail traders accounted for ~18.3% of the total options activity in June. Social media and online investing communities have influenced retail investors to the extent that these investors don\u2019t shy away from making investments in the downturn.\nIn late July and early August 2024, when there was a sharp decline in popular technology shares, retail investors turned out to be net buyers.\nVanda Research mentioned that individual investors, who were caught up in the market downturn, continued to be net buyers of shares of leading technology and AI-related companies. Just to balance out the risks, retail investors directed significant buying to an ETF tracking 20-Y Treasury bonds. Wall Street experts and enthusiasts believe that this confidence comes from the online investing communities and social media platforms, where there were discussions about going long on leading technology shares as they were trading at \u201cdecent levels.\u201d\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of hedge fund holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) operates as a technology company. It is engaged in developing a platform for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, and focuses on PC graphics.\nThe company\u2019s intangible assets associated with its graphics processing units and increased switching costs concerning its proprietary software are expected to act as principal growth enablers. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s roots revolve around gaming, and the company\u2019s patents related to hardware design helped it achieve market leading position in gaming GPUs. As a result of this dominant position, the company was able to build economies of scale and invest in R&D efforts.\nSpectrum-X Ethernet for Al and NVIDIA Al Enterprise software are the new product categories that are achieving significant scale. This demonstrates that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a full-stack and data center-scale platform.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s advanced intellectual property has created significant barriers to entry, which was evident when Intel decided to license IP from this tech giant. Notably, the data centers remain critical to power Al systems which can perform difficult tasks, such as speech recognition and photo recognition. Therefore, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to focus on leveraging its GPU prowess in emerging areas like data centers and automotive.\nWall Street analysts believe that a new class of products, data processing units (DPUs), can handle certain tasks. This will allow CPUs to focus on core applications. These analysts anticipate that DPUs will become commonplace in all servers.\nFor 3Q 2025, the company\u2019s revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% and GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins should be in the range of 74.4% and 75.0%. In 2Q 2025, the company saw record quarterly revenue of $30.0 billion, exhibiting a rise of 15% from 1Q 2025 and 122% YoY. The revenues were supported by global data centers, which continue to focus on modernizing the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative Al.\nUBS Group upped their price objective on the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) from $120.00 to $150.00. They gave a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on 8th\u00a0July.\nFred Alger Management, an investment management company, released its second quarter 2024 investor letter and mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put, Nvidia\u2019s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported better-than-expected fiscal first quarter results driven by strong demand from data centers. Additionally, management noted that large cloud service providers, contributing approximately 45% of data center sales, recognize the high return on investment offered by Nvidia\u2019s computing solutions, which are driving AI spending. The company also introduced its next-generation H200 chip, which nearly doubles the inference performance compared to the H100 chip, enhancing how trained AI models process new data. Lastly, management raised their fiscal second quarter guidance, noting that demand for their current H100 chips remains strong, and that demand for their next generation products is estimated to outstrip supply over the next year. We continue to believe the company is well positioned to potentially benefit from the growing AI data center workloads, which are driving demand for the increased interconnections and fully accelerated software stacks, thereby enabling leading application performance and fast result times.\u201d\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks that will go to the moon. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Perhaps no stock has prospered more from artificial intelligence (AI) than Nvidia. The semiconductor company leading in the development of AI chips brought triple-digit revenue and earnings growth, and at one point, the stock was up 1,000% from its late 2022 low.\nAlthough Nvidia will likely dominate the AI chip space for the foreseeable future, investors appear to have had second thoughts on Nvidia stock as a high valuation, and rising competition has led investors to question how much more that stock can grow in the near term. Hence, investors are looking elsewhere, and they might do well to shift their focus to Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM).\nAmid the focus on AI servers, investors may have overlooked the importance of smartphones in utilizing the technology. Since most users have a smartphone nearby, it will probably serve as the most heavily utilized AI interface. Moreover, with the 5G upgrade cycle having run its course, investors seem to have lost some interest in Qualcomm stock.\nFortunately, Qualcomm has worked to inspire its next upgrade cycle in the AI field. Qualcomm developed its AI-capable Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, allowing Apple to release its first AI-ready iPhone.\nAllied Market Research estimates the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the AI chip market at 38% through 2032. Before the 5G upgrade cycle ran its course, revenue in fiscal 2022 grew 39% yearly before falling by 19% the following year. Assuming the industry has begun a revenue upgrade cycle, such growth could return.\nAdditionally, Qualcomm stays on top by continuing to patent improving technology in smartphone chipsets. Thanks to this approach, even top companies like Apple have not been able to take its market lead. Despite telegraphing an intent to move on from Qualcomm, Apple has now extended its patent license agreement to March 2027, an indication of Qualcomm's indispensability.\nFurthermore, should consumer tastes change, Qualcomm does not rely on smartphones to drive its future. To that end, it pivoted into the Internet of Things and automotive beginning a few years ago. These two sectors made up 27% of Qualcomm's revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended June 23). With the automotive growing revenue by 87%, Qualcomm seems to have an additional high-growth business.\nSigns have begun to appear that another upgrade cycle is underway. Qualcomm's $29 billion in revenue reported for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 rose by less than 6% compared to year-ago levels. Still, if including fiscal Q3 only, the growth rate increases to 11%.\nAlso, Qualcomm slowed the rate of expense growth to 2%. Moreover, the company reported $768 million in investment income. That helped its net income for the first three quarters of 2024 grow to more than $7.2 billion, a 26% yearly increase.\nThe good news is that even after a significant decline this spring in an industry sell-off, Qualcomm stock is up nearly 55% over the last year.\nDespite those gains, its P/E ratio stands at just 22. This gives Qualcomm a lower earnings multiple among the largest semiconductor companies. As the company's revenue growth ramps up again, this earnings multiple will likely look increasingly appealing.\nAmid Nvidia's stock price moving far ahead of its growth, other semiconductor stocks in AI begin to stand out, and one well-positioned for growth is likely Qualcomm.\nQualcomm has long innovated in the smartphone chipset space, and thanks to its integration of AI, the market is likely entering a new upgrade cycle that should bolster Qualcomm for several quarters to come. Its continuous innovation also applies to its other businesses, particularly automotive, which are becoming new growth drivers for the company.\nFinally, its 22 P/E ratio is very low considering this approaching growth. That should bolster Qualcomm stock as customers and investors alike capitalize on the move to AI-enabled smartphones.\nBefore you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Qualcomm wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia shares keep falling. Should you buy the dip?",
        "Author": "  Greg McKenna ",
        "Text": "The rise of Nvidia has been synonymous with Wall Street\u2019s AI boom, but Tuesday\u2019s market sell-off hit the dominant chip maker\u2019s stock the hardest. Nvidia shed $279 billion in market cap, the biggest ever drop for an American company in a single day, before shares fell slightly further on Wednesday.\nAs Warren Buffett once said, it can pay \u201cto be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.\u201d \u00a0Do investors now have a rare opportunity to buy the dip for shares of a fast-growing company that accounted for roughly 30% of the S&P 500\u2019s total returns during the first half of the year?\nEven after the plunge, Nvidia\u2019s stock is still up 115% year to date. Analysts, though, have made clear investors should not expect shares\u2014which closed just above the $106 mark Wednesday, down from an all-time high of $140.76 in June\u2014to continue appreciating at the same pace. It is also common wisdom that revenue growth will inevitably decelerate given the eye-popping growth of previous quarters.\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nTo get an idea of why Nvidia's growth is poised to slow, consider its data center business, which has been the company\u2019s main revenue driver. Revenue from those operations hit a record $26.3 billion this past quarter, up 154% from a year ago. Nonetheless, it was a far cry from the unit\u2019s 427% revenue bump last quarter.\nThe company is running into the law of large numbers, Angelo Zino, a senior vice president and tech equity analyst at CFRA Research, said in an interview with Fortune before last week\u2019s Q2 earnings release. He urged caution to his clients heading into the call.\n\u201cBut that said, listen, I mean, when you look at the valuation of this company, it's trading at a big discount to where it actually historically trades at,\u201d he said.\nThat message was echoed by Bank of America analysts, a group led by Vivek Arya, even after Nvidia beat expectations in its latest earnings. Arya and his team raised their price target on the stock from $150 to $165. Zino and CFRA maintained its buy rating on the stock, standing pat with a price target of $139 for the year.\nAs of Tuesday close, Nvidia was trading around 68 times its diluted EPS, per S&P Global Market Intelligence. That\u2019s down from a P/E ratio of 180 last September.\nThe biggest long-term concern for Nvidia, Zino noted, is what happens when demand, which currently far outstrips supply, begins to dry up. In a tweet Wednesday morning, CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said he believed Nvidia\u2019s stock was significantly hurt by a note from Michael Cembalest, the chairman of market and investment strategy at J.P.

        "Text": "Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has a reputation for colorful quotes on tech stocks, and AI chip giant Nvidia has often been the target of his rhetorical arsenal.\nOn Thursday, he continued to make the bull case for Nvidia, comparing it to one of the greatest basketball players of all time.\n\"If you look at Nvidia here, this is LeBron in high school in terms of where this story is ultimately going,\" Ives told Bloomberg TV.\nLater in the interview, he circled back to the comparison and said the reason why Nvidia resembles a young LeBron James is because it's so far ahead of any other competitor and is \"the only game in town.\"\nThe remarks came as investors were sending Nvidia stock lower despite an earnings report that blew away forecasts late Wednesday.\nBut while Wall Street's concerns were focused on delays to the forthcoming Blackwell chips, Ives said CEO Jensen Huang put to rest those worries with revenue guidance that was still robust, even if it fell short of the most aggressive analyst views.\n\"They came. They delivered,\" he added about Nvidia earnings. \"And I think for tech, this is going to put fuel in that rally.\"\nBased on his channel checks in Asia, Ives estimated that Blackwell revenue could reach tens of billions of dollars, attributing the company's vaguer guidance to Huang being reluctant to reveal his playbook.\nHe also touted a multiplier effect Nvidia has across the broader tech landscape, saying every dollar spent on its chips ripples through the sector by a factor of eight to 10 times.\nThat's as Ives sees $1 trillion of capital expenditures on AI over the next three years\u2014double his forecast from just six months ago.\nDemand for Nvidia chips is also accelerating and widening beyond the so-called hyperscaler customers like Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, and Google, with other enterprises stepping up as more AI use cases emerge, he added.\n\"Rome wasn't built in a day, neither will the AI revolution,\" he predicted. \"It's starting to come together.\"\nIves wasn't the only Wall Street analyst looking past the initial stock market reaction to Nvidia's earnings report. Most still put shares in the \"buy\" category.\nBank of America\u00a0Global Research reiterated a buy rating and raised its price target on shares from $150 to $165, saying Nvidia remains the \u201ckey genAI cycle beneficiary\u201d and imploring investors to \u201cignore quarterly noise.\u201d\nNvidia stock closed Friday at $119.37, representing a weekly loss of about 8%.\n\u201cWe think the AI rally has further to run, despite investors\u2019 apparent disappointment with Nvidia\u2019s rapid profit growth,\u201d Thomas Matthews, Capital Economics\u2019 head of markets, Asia Pacific, said in a note.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has so far been the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. However, the hedge fund billionaires listed below trimmed their positions in Nvidia stock during the second quarter, while purchasing shares of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI).\nCliff Asness of AQR Capital Management sold 1.3 million shares of Nvidia, trimming his stake by 8%. He also bought 1,040 shares of Supermicro, nudging his position 2% higher.\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management sold 676,242 shares of Nvidia, cutting his stake by 5%. He also bought 553,323 shares of Supermicro, upping his position by 807%.\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors sold 9.2 million shares of Nvidia, slashing his stake by 79%. He also added 98,752 shares of Supermicro, increasing his position by 96%.\nDavid Shaw of D.E. Shaw & Co. sold 12.1 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 52%. He also opened a new position in Supermicro.\nTrades made by Griffin, Shaw, and Englander are especially noteworthy because they manage the three most successful hedge funds as measured by net gains since inception, according to LCH Investments. Importantly, all four fund managers still have major exposure to Nvidia, so we cannot assume they view the chipmaker as a bad investment.\nBut we can assume the fund managers see Supermicro as a worthwhile investment, and two Wall Street analysts evidently agree. Nehal Chokshi at Northland Securities and Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt have put 12-month price targets of $1,300 per share on Supermicro. Those forecasts imply 215% upside from its current share price of $413.\nHere's what investors should know about Nvidia and Supermicro.\nNvidia holds a market share of more than 90% in data center graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that speed up the processing of complex workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The company accounts for more than 70% of AI chip sales, and some analysts estimate its revenue share is above 90%. Nvidia also dominates the market for generative AI networking, according to Morningstar.\nHardware leadership is fantastic, but Nvidia has extended its ability to monetize AI with subscription software and cloud services, both of which generate recurring revenue. For instance, the Nvidia AI Foundry platform supports the development of custom generative AI models. And the Nvidia AI Enterprise platform supports the development of AI applications across use cases like robotics, recommender systems, and logistics route optimization.\nNvidia delivered a strong financial performance in its fiscal 2025 second quarter (which ended in July). Sales rose by 122% to $30 billion on strong demand for AI hardware and software. Non-GAAP earnings surged by 152% to $0.68 per diluted share.\nCFO Colette Kress said production of Blackwell GPUs would ramp up in the fourth quarter, about three months later than originally anticipated. Blackwell is Nvidia's next generation of data center chips. It offers up to four times faster AI training and 30 times faster AI inferencing than the previous Hopper architecture. \"The anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,\" CEO Jensen Huang told analysts.\nWall Street expects Nvidia to grow its earnings at an annualized rate of 37% over the next three years. That estimate makes its current valuation of 50 times earnings look reasonable. At that price, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the fund managers mentioned earlier have been buying Nvidia stock in the third quarter.\nSupermicro develops high-performance computing platforms for enterprise and cloud data centers. Its products range from individual servers to full server racks equipped with networking and storage. The company has secured a leadership position in the AI server market due to its internal manufacturing capabilities and its modular approach to product development.\nThose advantages let the company quickly build a broad range of server products with the latest chips from suppliers like Nvidia. Supermicro can typically bring new technologies to market faster than its competitors, often two to six months earlier. That time-to-market advantage should keep the company at the forefront of the AI server market.\nSupermicro reported mixed financial results in its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (which ended in June). Sales increased by 144% to $5.3 billion due to record demand for AI infrastructure. But gross profit margin contracted by nearly 6 percentage points, such that non-GAAP net income increased just 78% to $6.25 per diluted share. Management said its weaker margins came from temporary headwinds, but shares still plunged 20% the day after the Q4 report came out.\nShortly thereafter, shareholders got hit with more bad news when short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report alleging \"glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.\" Supermicro shares have plunged by 24% since the report was released in late August, such that the stock is now 65% off its all-time high.\nIn the last five years, Hindenburg has flagged alleged malfeasance at more than two dozen companies, sometimes with lasting consequences. For instance, Nikola shares have plunged 99% since the short-seller accused the company of lying to shareholders in September 2020. But some of Hindenburg's short reports have come to nothing. For instance, Block shares have advanced by 5% since the fintech was targeted by the short-seller in March 2023.\nGiven the available information, Samik Chatterjee at JPMorgan is not particularly concerned about the allegations regarding Supermicro. \"We see the report as largely void of details around alleged wrongdoings,\" he wrote in a recent note. He also maintained his price target of $950 per share, implying 130% upside.\nMore broadly, Wall Street still expects Supermicro to grow earnings by 46% annually over the next three years. That makes its current valuation of 21 times earnings look cheap. Those figures give it a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.46, which is a substantial discount to its three-year average of 0.89.\nHere's the bottom line: The stock probably won't triple in the next 12 months, and there is certainly risk surrounding the short report. However, the current price is a reasonable entry point for patient investors, and Supermicro has a good shot at beating the market over the next three to five years.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has delivered blistering gains since early last year, but it's been a wild ride. After surging 828%, the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker shed 27% of its value, though it's now down about 20%.\nExpectations were high going into Nvidia's second-quarter financial report. While the results were better than expected, they weren't enough to support the recent run-up. One Wall Street analyst believes the decline represents a compelling opportunity.\nIn the wake of Nvidia's financial report, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse reiterated his buy rating and $175 price target on Nvidia stock, which represents potential gains for investors of 62%, compared to Tuesday's closing price. Despite the stock's recent weakness, the analyst called Nvidia's results \"solid.\"\nMuse believes concerns about the delayed launch of Blackwell -- the company's next-generation AI architecture -- \"appears to be a nothing burger ahead of one of the biggest and baddest product cycles in Nvidia's history.\" With no change to the AI tailwinds driving Nvidia's growth, Muse believes the current price is \"still too cheap to ignore.\"\nThe analyst is clearly on top of his game. During the company's Q2 earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang said, \"The demand for Blackwell is incredible.\" He believes \"Blackwell is going to be a complete game changer for the industry\" because it \"provides three to five times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center\" than its predecessor, Hopper. Management expects \"several billion dollars\" in Blackwell revenue in the fourth quarter before it runs riot next year.\nNvidia is guiding for third-quarter revenue growth of roughly 80% year over year after five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, but we knew growth would slow eventually. Generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy over the coming decade, according to researchers at McKinsey & Company, and Nvidia is at the forefront of this paradigm shift.\nNvidia stock is currently selling for 38 times forward earnings.

        "Text": "Nov. 30, 2022, will go down as a defining moment in modern history. That's the day OpenAI released ChatGPT to the masses. Just like that, euphoria about artificial intelligence (AI) took over the world.\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom has been semiconductor specialist Nvidia. If you had bought shares of Nvidia on the same day that ChatGPT was introduced, you would be up 583% right now. Some investors might think that returns of this magnitude are rare. I disagree. Stocks move up for all sorts of reasons, even the most unconventional ones.\nWhat is rare, however, is finding a quality company with legitimate catalysts that can fuel long-term growth. Outside of AI, another growing narrative in the stock market surrounds the rise of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists for treating diabetes and obesity, such as Ozempic and Mounjaro.\nRecently, I watched an interview with Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza in which he referred to pharmaceutical leader Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) as the \"Nvidia of the GLP-1 and weight loss space.\" I love this analogy, and I agree with his take. Below, I break down several reasons why investing in Eli Lilly right now could be similar to doing so with Nvidia during the dawn of the AI revolution.\nGLP-1 agonists have become popular among diabetes and obesity patients. Today, Lilly has two leading GLP-1 medicines, Mounjaro and Zepbound. These treatments are sending shock waves through the pharmaceutical sector and have propelled a new phase of growth for Lilly.\nWhat's more, the company's own CEO, David Ricks, said the company hasn't even scratched the surface of its marketing and promotional efforts for its GLP-1 lineup. With that in mind, it's fair to think that Mounjaro and Zepbound have even better days ahead.\nOn top of that, Lilly continues to work hard to diversify beyond its injection-based weight loss treatments. The company's oral solution, orforglipron, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials.\nLastly, GLP-1 medicines are likely to witness more proliferation in the long run. Novo Nordisk's Wegovy was recently granted an expanded indication from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat cardiovascular disease in obesity patients. And Lilly has been exploring uses for treating obstructive sleep apnea.\nNvidia is best known for its chips called graphics processing units (GPUs). The company also has a large software business called CUDA that rarely gets spoken about. In a similar fashion, there is a lot more to Eli Lilly than its blockbuster GLP-1 drugs.\nOne of its other hit medicines is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor called Verzenio. It received FDA approval in 2017, and just last year it received an expanded indication to be used among certain cancer patients. This has broadened Verzenio's addressable market and sparked a new phase of accelerated growth for the drug.\nBeyond its core portfolio, Lilly is set to enter another area in healthcare. In July, the company received FDA approval for its Alzheimer's disease candidate, donanemab. Similar to the GLP-1 market, treating Alzheimer's has enormous potential. Yet there is limited competition today outside of Biogen's and Eisai's Leqembi.\nBesides its existing opportunities and robust pipeline of new medicines, Lilly is also at the forefront of technological innovation in healthcare.\nEarlier this year, it entered into partnership with OpenAI. The goal is to bring the capabilities of generative AI to the healthcare space in an effort to discover breakthrough treatments for sophisticated (and perhaps neglected) illnesses.\nI see a lot of overlap between Nvidia and Lilly. Both companies are the biggest names in their respective industries, and each has a proven track record of developing best-in-class products and services.\nSimilar to the AI narrative, I think the GLP-1 story is just beginning. To me, it's likely that new chapters will include growing applications for these medicines, which further bolsters Lilly's market potential. When you add the company's entrance into the Alzheimer's realm and the long-run prospects that AI poses for healthcare, it's hard to overstate all of the growth catalysts Lilly has going for it.\nI see it as a generational opportunity, and one that will continue minting significant gains for patient investors. I think now is a great time to buy shares of Eli Lilly and hold on for the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks for Beginners with Little Money According to Analysts.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other beginner stocks.\nOn one hand, some investors view the status quo as a bear market, and on the other, some analysts hold a bullish view. While caution is necessary, blue chip stocks with historically solid results have an edge in the risk department.\nGeopolitical tensions on the one hand and economic turmoil on the other, have created a concerning situation for investors. On September 3, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared in an interview on CNBC to share his outlook of the market. Lee is particularly concerned about the job market, the surprise inflation has in store for the economy, and weak growth projections.\nLee emphasized that investors must remain cautious for the next eight weeks or so, especially with elections and rate cuts, he predicts that the general public is bound to be nervous and confused. While his timeline may not be exact, he expects economic conditions and political turmoil to settle within the suggested time frame.\nHe further added that it is safer to be cautious than to make hasty decisions at the moment. He also stated that the oil industry is particularly weak due to geopolitical tensions despite a massive rise in production. Lee added that increasing production levels does not indicate a booming global economy, because, previously, production increased only because prices were rising which led to more drilling and activity in the sector.\nLee recommended that investors will be able to buy long, and therefore it is best to remain cautious. He further added that we already had 7% corrections twice this year, and there is a possibility of another 7% to 10% correction in the market. He did agree that the market is currently testing investors' patience and he predicts something close to a 5% pullback.\nOn September 6, Liz Ann Sonders, Charles Schwab's chief investment strategist, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss how investors should navigate the market right now. Sonders held a particularly bullish view of the market. She further added that while there has been significant weakness and churn on the surface, it is concealed by cap-weighted index returns.\nSonders suggested that the market level declines were most likely a set-up for the broadening out we have witnessed. She shared her point of view on the market, which is rather bullish, and emphasized that stocks in the consumer discretionary, technology, and communication services sectors are doing particularly well. Sonders, however, did point out that the market may see an exhaustion in the mega-cap tech trade.\nShe then suggests that investors must let go of the perception that to succeed they must invest in mega-cap tech stocks. She states that there are a myriad of opportunities outside of the mega-cap tech that are high quality. Finally, Sonders believes that a recession is not on the cards and that the current situation is nothing more than a growth scare.\nNow that we have assessed the market, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks for beginners with little money according to analysts. You can also take a look at the best defensive stocks to buy.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 7 best stocks for beginners with little money according to analysts we sifted over multiple similar rankings and ETFs to come up with safe and blue chip stocks. The rationale behind this was that investors with little money don't afford to lose a lot and are more likely to invest in stocks that are safer or risk-free. We then sorted our stocks based on their upside potential. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nAnalyst Upside as of September 10: 42%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Folders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most popular stocks at the moment, also referred to as the AI star. The GPU maker is known for its cloud solutions, chip systems, and growing role in producing artificial intelligence solutions.\nThe company's Advanced AI platform for Enterprise improves productivity, streamlines AI workflows, and ensures faster deployment and processing of AI. Its networking platform for AI, Spectrum X, is projected to become a multi-billion dollar entity in a year. Moreover, earlier this year, the company introduced its Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU), backed by six different technologies. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects to ramp production of Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter and ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Currently, the demand for its GPUs exceeds the supply.\nOverall, the company logged $ 26.3 billion in data center revenue, up 16% from the previous quarter and 154% year-over-year. The revenue growth was driven by strong demand for Nvidia's GPU Computing platform. Compute revenue grew by 2.5x and networking revenue expanded by 2x compared to the previous year. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) logged $30 billion in revenue during the FQ2 of 2025, up by 122% year-over-year, well above its outlook of only $28 billion.\nAnalysts are bullish on NVDA and their 12-month median price target of $150 points to a 42% upside from current levels. At the close of Q2 2024, 179 investors were bullish on NVDA, with total stakes amounting to $53.7 billion. Of those, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the highest stakeholder with a position of $18.35 billion.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best beginner stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The company has been in the limelight for years, remaining an investor favorite. Shares of NVDA have risen by over 175% over the past year, propelling the wealth of its co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who holds a 3% stake. Today, Huang has over $101 billion net worth, making him the 15th richest man in the world.\nThe origins of NVIDIA are as fascinating as its ascent to market leader.

None of us knew how to do anything.\"\nSince then, Huang has successfully steered NVIDIA to become the largest chip manufacturer pandering to the artificial intelligence markets.

Just two years after its inception in 1995, NVIDIA was on the verge of bankruptcy when its low-cost processing chip was rendered \"technically poor\" for graphics. At the time, Huang got a financial lifeline from video gaming company Sega, which gave them funds to stay afloat for six months.\n\"At Nvidia, I [have] experienced failures. Great big ones \u2013 all humiliating and embarrassing,\" Huang said during a commencement speech at National Taiwan University last year, adding, \"The CEO of Sega, to his credit and my amazement, agreed. His understanding and generosity gave us six months to live.\"\nDuring this time, NVIDIA launched the RIVA 128 chip \u2013 the company's first big hit, selling over a million units in just four months in 1997. This was just the starting point for the chip giant, which grew to become the second most valuable company in the world. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's revenues rose at a compound annual growth rate of 39.1%, while its earnings per share rose at a compounded rate of 47.9% per year since 2019.\n\"This is the most extraordinary thing,\" he said. \"That a normal dishwasher busboy could grow up to be this.

        "Text": "The leading semiconductor company and the artificial intelligence (AI) king NVIDIA NVDA plunged 9.5% on Tuesday, wiping nearly $300 billion off the chipmaker\u2019s market cap and pulling chip stocks down with it. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH, an index that tracks semiconductor stocks, was off 7.5%, marking its worst day since March 2020, per CNBC.\nAccording to a recent asset allocation report from Tiger 21, an exclusive network of ultra-high-net-worth individuals and entrepreneurs, over half of its members are not invested in NVIDIA, as quoted on CNBC. The report revealed that 57% of members have opted out of Nvidia, due to concerns about its sustained growth and market dominance.\nReasons for Avoidance\nMichael Sonnenfeldt, chairman of Tiger 21, highlighted reasons behind members' reluctance to invest in NVIDIA. Despite NVIDIA's current leadership in AI technology, some members fear that its growth may slow down as competitors catch up.\nA Motley Fool article revealed that NVIDIA\u2019s revenue growth will slow down from the triple-digit pace at which it has been growing recently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA\u2019s current-year revenues is pegged at $122.2 billion, up 100.6% year over year. The next year\u2019s revenue estimate is pegged at $165.7 billion, up 35.6% from the current year.\nNVIDIA\u2019s earnings estimate for the current year is pegged at $2.76, up 112.3% year over year. The next year\u2019s earnings estimate is pegged at $3.52, up 27.5% from the current year. Hence, we can expect a growth slowdown in NVIDIA next year, although it appears strong in the current year.\nOverall Portfolio Allocation\nThe asset allocation of Tiger 21 members predominantly includes private equity (28%) and real estate (26%), despite challenges such as high interest rates. Public equities, including selective tech investments like NVIDIA, make up about 22% of their overall portfolios. Among the 43% who do hold Nvidia shares, many are hesitant to increase their holdings due to perceived high valuation risks.\nInside NVDA Stock\u2019s Valuation\nNVIDIA stock\u2019s Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio (trailing 12 months) stands at 54.01X versus the underlying Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s P/E of 8.97X. The last five years\u2019 growth rate for NVIDIA was 54.20% versus the underlying industry\u2019s growth rate of 9.10%. This exponential growth rate of NVIDIA explains its ripe valuation.\nFor the next five years, NVIDIA\u2019s growth rate is expected to be 41.70% versus the industry\u2019s growth rate of 17.80%. With slower growth expected for the coming fiscal years, NVIDIA's forward P/E ratio would decline.\nPer Motley Fool, \u201cif it were to grow revenue 30% in fiscal year 2028, a multiple of 30 to 40 times on the stock in 2027 would seem reasonable. That would value the stock between $200 and $270 per share in three years. As such, there is a good possibility that Nvidia's stock could once again double from where it is now in three years.\u201d\nIf you are worried about NVIDIA\u2019s prospective slowing growth trajectory and still take advantage of the AI boom, you can stay invested in the NVDA-heavy semiconductor exchange-traded funds (ETF). The ETF approach minimizes the company-specific concentration risks.\nSome NVIDIA-heavy ETFs include Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Grizzle Growth ETF DARP and TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF LRNZ.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Investing.com -- David Tepper, founder of Appaloosa Management, advised caution when it comes to buying the dip in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock, citing uncertainty in the long-term growth prospects of artificial intelligence.\nIn an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday, Tepper revealed that while Nvidia's stock looks attractive to him, he remains hesitant about making further investments in the chipmaker.\n\"We sold a lot of our Nvidia. We thought [it] was too high at the time and would come down. Unfortunately, we didn't buy it when it came back down,\" Tepper told CNBC.\nThe hedge fund manager reduced his Nvidia holdings by more than 80% in the second quarter, bringing his stake to about $85 million by the end of June, according to CNBC.\nWhile Tepper acknowledged that Nvidia, a major player in the AI boom, could still have some upside, he expressed doubts about the sustainability of AI demand.\n\"Do you have enough power for the growth? Do you have the next generation models that can take their chip?\" he questioned, when talking to CNBC.\nNvidia has seen a meteoric rise, gaining close to 200% in the last 12 months and more than 157% this year. The stock is up a further 2.9% in Thursday's session, with its market cap currently sitting at well over $3 trillion.\nHowever, Tepper remains uncertain about whether the company can maintain this trajectory, particularly beyond 2026.\nHe explained that \"different things that have to happen to make the growth projections happen.\"\n\"I'm not saying it won't happen. I'm just not smart enough to know if they will,\" he said to CNBC.\nTepper also highlighted his hesitation to invest in Nvidia due to the unpredictable nature of AI's impact on earnings. \"The variation of where that earnings can be is too much.

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "By most standards, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) hit the ball out of the park with its fiscal 2025 second-quarter results. The company reported record revenue of $30 billion, a 122% year-over-year increase. It posted earnings that soared 168% from the prior-year period. Nvidia's guidance projected even higher revenue next quarter.\nAnd yet the stock sank after these stellar numbers. Although Nvidia exceeded Wall Street estimates, the GPU maker didn't hit the \"whisper\" earnings number that was higher than the consensus public analysts' estimate.\nWall Street predicted Nvidia stock was headed lower even before its Q2 update. Here's what analysts think now.\nBefore I get to analysts' current thinking about Nvidia, let me first assure you that I don't view any of them as having Nostradamus-like predictive powers. The average Wall Street price target for Nvidia before the company's Q2 update was roughly 2% below its closing price prior to the earnings release. However, this was a 12-month price target. Nvidia fell more than that almost immediately on the day after its Q2 announcement.\nImportantly, most Wall Street analysts weren't all that negative about Nvidia. Of the 38 analysts surveyed by LSEG in August, 14 rated Nvidia as a \"buy.\" Another seven recommended the stock as a \"strong buy.\" That's a majority (55%) with positive views about Nvidia. Most of the other analysts -- 14 of them -- rated the stock as a \"hold.\" Only two assigned a negative \"underperform\" or \"sell\" rating to Nvidia.\nBut the average price target still reflected an expectation that the stock would fall over the next 12 months. I describe the analysts who maintain positive ratings on Nvidia yet give it price targets lower than the current share price as bullish bears or bearish bulls. They want to have it both ways.\nLet's now shift to what analysts say about Nvidia after its Q2 update. LSEG reported that 18 analysts issued reports on Nvidia on Aug. 29 (the day after its quarterly earnings release). Guess how many changed their recommendation? Pat yourself on the back if you answered zero.\nHowever, several analysts did adjust their 12-month price targets. The average price target is now roughly 5% below Nvidia's share price. Wall Street is still full of bullish bears/bearish bulls.\nAnalysts seem to be sticking with their stories. Most of them still like Nvidia. Only one of those 18 updates was less than positive -- and it was a \"neutral\" rating. But they nonetheless think the stock could decline.\nThe big question is: Why? Maybe it's because some analysts (perhaps many of them) don't believe Nvidia's customers will see positive returns on investment (ROI) with their purchases of the company's GPUs. For example, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari asked in the Q2 earnings call about customer ROI, noting that \"there's a pretty heated debate in the market\" about the subject. TD Cowen's Matt Ramsay also raised a question about customer ROI.\nI think it's possible that Wall Street could be wrong about Nvidia's stock performance over the next 12 months. I also think those who don't expect Nvidia's customers to see strong ROI could be wrong.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang pushed back on skepticism about customer ROI. He argued in the Q2 earnings call, \"The people who are investing in Nvidia infrastructure are getting returns on it right away.\"\nHuang rightly noted that a major data center migration from CPUs to GPUs is underway. He highlighted the tremendous potential for Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, which will begin shipping in fiscal 2025 Q4. He pointed out the promise of generative AI in robotics, software development, large-scale recommendation systems, and more.\nAll of this translates to significant growth prospects for Nvidia, not just over the next 12 months but over the next 10 years and beyond. We just might see Wall Street's price targets better align with their recommendations for the stock in the next few months as Nvidia begins to report its Blackwell revenue.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Pei Li, Mackenzie Hawkins and Debby Wu ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Beijing is stepping up pressure on Chinese companies to buy locally produced artificial intelligence chips instead of Nvidia Corp. products, part of the nation\u2019s effort to expand its semiconductor industry and counter US sanctions.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Corner Store Comeback\nA Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda\u2019s Capital City\nGang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon\u2019s Fast-Growing Cities\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai\u2019s Sky-High Rents\nRoofs of Mexico City\u2019s Massive Food Market Will Power Public Buses\nChinese regulators have been discouraging companies from purchasing Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips, which are used to develop and run AI models, according to people familiar with the matter. The policy has taken the form of guidance rather than an outright ban, as Beijing wants to avoid handicapping its own AI startups and escalating tensions with the US, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.\nThe move is designed to help domestic Chinese AI chipmakers gain more market share while preparing local tech companies for any potential additional US restrictions, the people said. The country\u2019s leading makers of AI processors include Cambricon Technologies Corp. and Huawei Technologies Co. Earlier this year, Beijing also told local electric-vehicle makers to procure more of their supplies from local chipmakers, part of its campaign to reach self-sufficiency in critical technologies.\nNvidia shares fell as much as 3.9% to $119.26 on Friday, extending an earlier decline, after Bloomberg reported the news. The stock has more than doubled this year.\nThe US government banned Nvidia from selling its most advanced AI processors to Chinese customers in 2022, part of an attempt to limit Beijing\u2019s technological advances. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, modified subsequent versions of the chips so they could be sold under US Commerce Department regulations. The H20 line fits that criteria.\nIn recent months, several Chinese regulators, including the powerful Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, issued so-called window guidance \u2014 instructions without the force of law \u2014 to reduce the use of Nvidia, the people said. The notice was aimed at encouraging companies to rely on domestic vendors like Huawei and Cambricon, they added. Beijing also amplified the message via a local trade group, according to another.\nAt the same time, Chinese officials want local companies to build the best AI systems possible. If that means they need to buy some foreign semiconductors over domestic alternatives, Beijing will still tolerate that, according to people familiar with China\u2019s AI policy.\nNvidia declined to comment. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Information and Technology, and Cyberspace Administration didn\u2019t respond to faxed requests for comment.\nSeparately, Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said Friday that he\u2019s doing his best to serve customers in China and stay within the requirements of US government restrictions.\n\u201cThe first thing we have to do is comply with whatever policies and regulations that are being imposed,\u201d he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. \u201cAnd, meanwhile, do the best we can to compete in the markets that we serve. We have a lot of customers there that depend on us, and we\u2019ll do our best to support them.\u201d\nNvidia, the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker, has seen sales soar as data center operators across the globe scramble to buy more of its processors. China continues to be part of that growth, though trade restrictions have taken a toll. In the July quarter, it got 12% of its revenue, or about $3.7 billion, from the country, including Hong Kong. That was up more than 30% from a year earlier.\n\u201cOur data center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and is a significant contributor to our data center revenue,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said during an earnings call in August. \u201cAs a percentage of total data center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls. We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive going forward.\u201d\nWhy World Powers Are Sparring Over Computer Chips: QuickTake\nNvidia chips are the gold standard for companies looking to develop artificial intelligence services. The likes of Meta Platforms Inc., OpenAI and Alphabet Inc. have been racing to scoop up its most cutting-edge products so they can build leading AI models. Several Chinese tech companies, including ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., stockpiled Nvidia\u2019s chips before the export controls took effect.\nChinese chip designers and manufacturers, meanwhile, are working to introduce alternatives to Nvidia. Beijing has offered billions in subsidies to the semiconductor sector, but local AI chips remain well behind Nvidia\u2019s fare.\nChina does have a burgeoning AI sector, though, despite the US restrictions. ByteDance and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. have been investing aggressively, while a flock of startups are vying for leadership. There are six so-called tigers in developing large language models, the key technology behind generative AI: 01.AI, Baichuan, Moonshot, MiniMax, Stepfun and Zhipu.\nSome of the companies are turning a blind eye to the Chinese decree to avoid H20 chips and rushing to buy more of them before an anticipated sanction from the US by the end of this year, one of the people said, though they are also buying homemade Huawei chips to please Beijing.\n--With assistance from John Liu, Jessica Sui, Zheng Wu, Ian King and Tyler Kendall.\n(Updates with Nvidia shares in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAdam Neumann\u2019s Latest Project Is a WeWork Competitor\nHow Bogg Bags, the Crocs of Totes, Won Over America\u2019s Moms\nThe Great \u20ac3 Billion Shipping Container Heist\nElon Musk\u2019s Role in Reanimating the Far-Right Term \u2018Remigration\u2019\nHow a Short Seller\u2019s Attack Threatens This Spanish Family Company\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia has been a tough act to follow in recent years. The artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant has delivered triple-digit increases in earnings quarter after quarter, and the share price has followed. Nvidia stock has soared more than 2,400% over the past five years, and considering the company's focus on innovation, this stellar performance may continue.\nThough Nvidia has garnered the greatest share of investor attention in recent times, another tech player actually outperformed this AI powerhouse in the first half of the year. And this company followed in Nvidia's footsteps recently by announcing a stock split, a move to bring a high-flying share price down to earth -- and make the stock more accessible for a broader range of investors.\nNow, Wall Street predicts this player's gains may be far from over. Let's meet the new stock-split stock that analysts think could nearly double within the coming 12 months...\nAnd this stock is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), a company that saw its stock price soar 188% in the first half, surpassing Nvidia's 149% increase. Though individual forecasts vary, the average Wall Street estimate calls for the stock to climb 90% from today's level.\nIt's important to note that this once high-flying stock has been wading through difficult waters in recent weeks. A short report released by Hindenburg Research, alleging troubles at the company, has weighed on the shares. In an unrelated move, Supermicro delayed the filing of its 10-K annual report, and this has represented an additional headwind.\nI see these as short-term pressures, but they don't change Supermicro's long-term story. And considering the 20% decline in the stock since the short report, it looks dirt cheap right now -- it trades for only 13 times forward earnings estimates, down from more than 45 times earlier in the year.\nIn recent days, some analysts have highlighted the potential of Supermicro. For example, Needham rated Supermicro a buy in new coverage of the stock -- and Needham expects a gain of 37% in the months to come.\nWhy should we be so optimistic about Supermicro? First, the company has proven its ability to dominate in the area of full rack scale solutions for data centers. Supermicro's servers and other products share many common parts so the company can more quickly build a particular item to suit a customer's needs. The equipment maker also works very closely with all of the top chipmakers -- including Nvidia -- so that it can immediately include their innovations in its products. This has helped revenue in one single quarter surpass annual revenue as recently as 2021.\nSecond, Supermicro now faces a major opportunity that could launch a whole new wave of lasting growth for the company. One of the biggest problems facing the data centers of today and tomorrow is the fact that AI workloads produce excessive heat. Supermicro's direct liquid cooling (DLC) technology, once a slow-growth business, now promises to offer explosive growth.\nThe company predicts that within the coming 12 months, 25% to 30% of data centers will be equipped with DLC, and Supermicro will dominate this market. At the same time, Supermicro is preparing for demand for DLC and its equipment in general as it brings online its Malaysia facility -- one that will focus on volume and speed.\nConsidering forecasts of an AI market to reach $1 trillion by the end of the decade, and the key role of data centers in all of this, Supermicro's revenue could continue to climb for quite some time.\nAs for the stock split, Supermicro will trade at its new split-adjusted price as of Oct. 1. This won't change anything fundamental about the company or stock -- valuation and market value remain the same. So, it won't act as a catalyst for share performance, but it is a positive move as it will make it easier for more investors to buy the stock over time.\nAll of this represents a lot of positive points for Supermicro, setting the stage for major growth potential -- and making it a fantastic stock to buy on the dip.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Maham Fatima ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Reddit.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks.\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent in current world affairs, new patterns concerning its research and development strategies are also emerging.\u00a0Traditionally, academia has focused on basic research and education, while industry concentrated on applied research and commercialization. However, in recent years, the commercial sector's dominance in AI investment and research has raised concerns about the balance of power. The shift of researchers from academia to industry has also raised questions.\nAdvanced AI systems increasingly require large amounts of data, compute power, and funding resources that industry actors possess in greater quantities than academia and nonprofits. Hence, AI research, which was originally the domain of academia in the early 2000s is now being taken over by industry.\nWe recently talked about this division in another article we published, 7 Most Popular AI Penny Stocks Under $5, here's an excerpt from it:\n\u201cA recent study from Stanford University found that businesses train AI models faster than academic institutions. In 2023, the industry-trained AI neared 51 significant machine learning models, while academia managed only 15. This trend persisted in 2024 despite rising training costs. ChatGPT 4, the latest model of ChatGPT, cost about $80 million to train. Google\u2019s Gemini Ultra cost around $191 million.\u201d\nA 2021 Stanford report says that the reason behind the blurring roles of academia and industry is that businesses come with affordable cloud computing, open-source libraries, and pre-trained models that incentivize university researchers to pursue commercial applications of their work. More and more industry papers are now appearing at conferences, raising concerns about applied research stifling long-term innovation or being biased toward corporate interests, all while also accelerating solutions for real-world problems.\nA 2023 paper in the journal Science states that businesses attract 70% of the top talent with PhDs in AI today, as compared to just 20% 2 decades ago. The number of AI research faculty in academia has stagnated, while industry hiring has surged 8 times since 2006. Industry models being substantially larger (about 29 times), indicating superior computing power, is a huge reason behind this.\nIn 2021, US government agencies allocated a total of $1.5 billion for academic AI research, while Google spent the same amount on a single project in just one year.\nThe largest AI models are now developed in industry 96% of the time. Leading benchmarks are also primarily industry-driven, accounting for 91% of the total. Furthermore, the number of published papers with industry co-authors has nearly doubled since 2000.\nYet, there's another anticipated shift as academic researchers are increasingly able to deploy their inventions in real-world settings. Duolingo, a language learning app developed by academics, is a successful example.\nA distinguished MIT professor, Fr\u00e9do Durand, believes academia can still be a driving force for innovation. He says that 25 years ago, the field of computer graphics in academia faced a similar resource imbalance where the industry created stunning visuals that academia couldn't match. However, instead of trying to mimic industry, academia took a different path and focused on ideas like advanced lighting simulations, fluid dynamics, and machine learning for animation. These seemingly outlandish ideas eventually became the foundation of modern rendering and graphics hardware.\nDurand believes this approach holds valuable lessons for AI research. He emphasizes the importance of academia pursuing unconventional approaches, openly sharing their work, and maintaining a sense of excitement about the field.\nHowever, he recognizes the challenges for academia and suggests potential solutions including increased government funding for academic research, shared research infrastructure, and strategies to keep top AI talent within academia. While industry seems to be taking over AI in general, collaborative partnerships with academia could yield better results. In one way or the other, AI will remain a hot topic in the coming times.\nMethodology\nTo compile our list, we sifted through several active subreddits to compile a list of 15 AI stocks to buy. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading designer and manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips are essential for rendering graphics, but now they're also used in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data centers.\nIn FQ2 2025, the company recorded a rather higher year-over-year improvement of 122.40% in revenue. The revenue generated in this period was $30.04 billion, beating analyst estimates by $1.29 billion. Data center revenue was up 54% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and our networking platforms. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45%\u00a0 of data center revenue.\nDespite such growth, the company's shares fell following this report. This is because investors had concerns about Blackwell chip production and slowing data center growth. Still, its shares were held by 179 hedge funds. Fisher Asset Management is the biggest shareholder with shares worth $11.54 billion, as of June 30. Later in late August, management approved a buyback of $50 billion in equity shares.\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces pressure to launch new products to maintain investor confidence. Factors like delays in Blackwell chip production and concerns about high GPU prices are what impact the demand. While CUDA software is a competitive advantage, the company's future success depends on continued innovation and effective AI monetization. Market experts are also forecasting a shift to robotics for the company's growth. Management expects AI revenue to reach low-double-digit billions this year.\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cIf Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA\u2019s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

It would be a good guess, but it would be incorrect. Vistra, an energy stock, is the correct answer. This company's stock is up roughly 300% on the year and almost 40% in September alone.\nThat's strong enough to make it the top-gaining stock in the S&P 500 this year. So, what makes Vistra (NYSE: VST) so special? As it turns out, chipmakers like Nvidia are not the only beneficiaries of AI's emergence as \"the next big thing\" in the public and private sectors. Energy companies are also seeing a kick-on effect, mainly because AI's appetite for data only matches its appetite for power.\nCheck It Out:\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\nCan you guess how much the average retirement account balance is? Here\u2019s a hint \u2014 it\u2019s only slightly more than a year\u2019s worth of expenses.\nThat's good news for energy stocks, but especially for Vistra because of the type of power it provides. Vistra specializes in operating nuclear power facilities, which AI companies and data center operators increasingly look to as an energy source for the new hyperscale data centers.\nInvestors are beginning to realize that AI can't reach its potential without access to ample power. Vistra has a jump on the competition because it already has nuclear plants online. These facilities cost billions to construct and take years to come online, but AI's power demands are already beginning to strain local power grids, making energy companies very popular with investors.\nAnalysts like Antoine Aurimond of Jeffries have taken notice, recently raising his outlook on Vistra's stock price from $99 to $137. If Vistra continues its upward climb, it might hit those numbers. Vistra shares were trading around $38 in January but have since rocketed to $118.54. That news will come as music to the ears of Vistra shareholders.\nTrending: Get \u2018em while you can \u2014 investing in this asset class may be reaching a high-water mark but you can still make returns right now.\nAurimond told Marketwatch why he expects continued growth for Vistra, saying, \u201cThe grid is going to be super tight in terms of supply/demand and there's just not enough new capacity coming online because that takes time.\" He's not alone in his bullish predictions on Vistra, as Morgan Stanley analyst David Arcaro has raised his expectations for Vistra shares from $110 to $132.\nMuch of the excitement surrounding Vistra and nuclear power providers in general tracks back to energy deals between nuclear energy provider Constellation and Microsoft or Talen Energy's similar pact with Amazon. Although that kind of deal is not currently on the table for Vistra, it's clear many investors and analysts believe there is potential for one.\nAurimond also pointed out that Vistra has a few other cards that make it a potential long-term winner. Vistra's operation is not as large as Constellation's, but other aspects of Vistra's infrastructure may give it an advantage. Aurimond told Marketwatch that Vistra is \"one of the biggest holders of efficient gas plants across the country,\u201d which he said \"could be a huge source of upside.\"\nThe AI revolution is evolving every day and like the internal combustion engine, it will change how the world works in ways that are currently unimaginable. That will create tremendous opportunities for investors in multiple sectors, including energy and data centers.

        "Author": "  Colin Laidley ",
        "Text": "Nvidia stock was on track Friday to close out one of its best weeks all year as it rebounded from a two-week slump that erased more than 20% of the advanced chipmaker's market value.\nNvidia stock hit turbulence in recent weeks as Wall Street's AI enthusiasm waned and its quarterly earnings report fell short of lofty expectations.\nDemand for AI and the Nvidia chips that enable it is expected to remain strong ,according to analysts, the vast majority of whom are still bullish on the stock despite its recent loss of momentum.\nBernstein analysts in a note earlier this week reiterated Nvidia was one of their top semiconductor picks, calling it \u201cthe best way to play AI.\u201d\nNvidia (NVDA) stock was on track Friday to notch one of its best weeks of the year and recover most of its losses from previous weeks as investors heeded analysts' recommendations and bought the dip.\nNvidia shares were little changed midday Friday, putting the stock up nearly 16% for the week in its second massive rebound in a volatile month for the chipmaker\u2019s stock.\nShares got a boost earlier this week when CEO Jensen Huang, speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference, called demand for Nvidia's products \"incredible\" and touted the size of the company's market opportunity.\n\"Generative AI is not just a tool. It is a skill,\" Huang told Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon at the event. \"And so that's why people think that AI is going to expand beyond the $1 trillion of data centers and IT, and into the world of skills.\"\nNvidia's rebound came after the stock tumbled more than 20% in the prior two weeks as Wall Street\u2019s optimism about all things AI waned and its quarterly earnings report, despite exceeding official estimates, fell short of investors\u2019 lofty expectations.\nAnd yet the turbulence appeared to have more to do with market sentiment than with the strength of the chipmaker\u2019s business.\nReports that Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell system would be delayed by a design flaw contributed to a sharp sell-off in early August. However, as far as analysts can tell, delays won\u2019t have much impact on quarterly sales.\nThat\u2019s in part because demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips is so strong that customers will take whatever they can get.\nCloud hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL) each said in their most recent earnings reports that they would continue to up their AI infrastructure spending\u2014a substantial amount of which goes toward Nvidia chips\u2014throughout this year and next as they build out their AI capabilities. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk estimated that the electric vehicle maker would spend between $3 and $4 billion on Nvidia\u2019s chips this year, representing as much as 40% of its total AI spending.\nThe sheer strength of demand is one major reason that analysts still have Nvidia at the top of their buy lists despite the stock\u2019s loss of momentum lately. Bernstein analysts in a note earlier this week reiterated Nvidia was one of their top semiconductor picks, calling it \u201cthe best way to play AI.\u201d\n\u201cYes, the numbers are so good (and moving so high, so fast) that investors worry about sustainability,\u201d the analysts wrote. \u201cHowever,\u201d with margins likely to improve next year while Blackwell sales ramp up, \u201cthe time to worry is clearly not now.\u201d\nBank of America Securities analysts struck a similar note when they argued late last week that Nvidia stock\u2019s pullback offered an \u201cenhanced Buy opportunity.\u201d\nOf the 63 Nvidia analysts tracked by FactSet Research, 50 rated the stock a \u201cBuy,\u201d the highest possible rating. Only four analysts gave the stock a neutral rating, and none recommended investors sell it.\nRead the original article on Investopedia.\n"

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock hasn't gone on sale often, but when it has dipped slightly since 2023, it has been a no-brainer buying opportunity for investors. While investors may have missed the bottom of the dip when it was down around 25%, is a 10% discount still a good enough price to pay?\nNvidia stock is down 10% from its all-time high set in June. If you're considering Nvidia stock now, are you buying it for a 10% return or looking for something even bigger?\nNvidia has been the talk of the investing world for nearly two years. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are used by those who want top-tier computing performance. These GPUs have been used almost exclusively by some of the world's largest artificial intelligence (AI) researchers, which has caused Nvidia's business to boom.\nDemand for its GPUs continues to pick up. In Q2 FY 2023 (ending July 31, 2022), Nvidia's revenue was $6.7 billion. In Q2 FY 2024 (ending July 30, 2023), it was $13.5 billion. Most recently, in Q2 FY 2025 (ending July 28), it was $30 billion. It's rare for a company to more than quadruple its revenue in just two years, let alone one doing it at Nvidia's size. However, its run is expected to continue, as management has guided for revenue of $32.5 billion in Q3.\nClearly, the demand for Nvidia's GPU hasn't been satisfied, so buying the dip here looks smart, at least in the short term.\nLooking forward through the next year, we can use Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and compare that to its trailing P/E to understand what kind of growth Wall Street has already baked into the stock.\nAt 56 times trailing earnings and 42 times forward earnings, Nvidia needs to achieve 33% earnings growth over the next year to achieve that valuation. If you look at Q2's earnings per share growth of 168%, you're probably inclined to think that will be an easy task. But there's more to that story.\nNvidia's margins significantly expanded as demand for its GPUs rose.\nStarting in Q3, we will directly compare Nvidia's high profit margins against each other year over year, so Nvidia's profit growth will still be impressive, but not in the 100%-plus year-over-year range.\nAs a result, its earnings growth will be more closely tied to revenue growth, but with 80% growth expected, it's still going to be very impressive.\nSo with earnings growth of around 80% expected in Q3, I'd say Nvidia is also on track for the medium term.\nLast comes the hardest part of the projection, the long term. If you believe that AI growth will continue, you're already expecting artificial intelligence to play a large role in our daily lives. The question is how much computing power it will require.\nOnce the big AI developers build out enough computing power to process all the AI training they want, Nvidia's sales will likely suffer greatly. But when this will happen is anyone's guess. It could be decades away or right around the corner. With the beginning stages of AI deployment and training just occurring, I'd guess it will be some time before Nvidia struggles.\nWith Nvidia checking all three boxes from a timing perspective, I think investors can confidently buy the dip in Nvidia's stock here.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Could Nvidia Stock Double in the Next Year?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been on an unprecedented run for a company its size. In 2023, the stock rose nearly 240%. While 2024 hasn't been nearly as good, it has still been impressive, with Nvidia's stock rising around 108% so far.\nInvestors have gotten a bit spoiled by Nvidia's performance over the past two years, and the status quo may lead some to think Nvidia could double again in the next year. Is this possible?\nNvidia's rise has been directly tied to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) computing. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are instrumental in training AI models, as they can process multiple calculations in parallel. Nvidia's products are pretty much undisputed as the best choice in the space, so it naturally became the top pick for any company looking to build out its AI computing infrastructure. The key here is that these companies don't buy one or two GPUs; they connect thousands of these devices to create a machine that can quickly process incredible amounts of information.\nAs a result of this demand, Nvidia's sales have gone through the roof.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 (ending July 28), its revenue rose 122% year over year to $30 billion. Its data center business had the best quarter, with revenue rising 154% year over year to $26.3 billion. One thing to note here is that it also rose 16% quarter over quarter, which shows demand is still ramping up.\nThe performance isn't going away, either. In Q3, management expects $32.5 billion in revenue.\nClearly, Nvidia's business is crushing it, and demand is still increasing. But is this enough to cause the stock to double?\nFor Nvidia's stock to double, the company would need to be worth $5.2 trillion. For context, the world's largest company is Apple, which is worth under $3.4 trillion.\nThat's a tall task in just a year, and it's unlikely that it could be accomplished in this time.\nWhy? Because all of Nvidia's growth is already baked into the stock. If you take a look at Nvidia's valuation metrics, you can calculate that Wall Street has already baked in around 33% earnings growth from now until the end of its fiscal year.\nWhile Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) rose 168% in Q2, this figure is about to face tough comparisons now that it's overlapping some of fiscal 2024's strong quarters. Furthermore, a price tag of 50 times trailing earnings and 37 times forward earnings is quite expensive.\nIt's more common for a company with a strong pedigree, like Nvidia, to trade for around 30 times forward earnings. So, not only does Nvidia's stock have a bit to go before returning to that point, it would also need to double its earnings for the stock to double.\nWhen could that be?\nAt Nvidia's current stock price, it would need its forward EPS projections to be $7.08 to be worth 15 times forward earnings. Because we set the base valuation at 30 times forward earnings, this would result in the stock price doubling.\nFinding far-out earnings projections isn't easy, and only one Wall Street analyst provides fiscal 2028 (ending January 2028) EPS projections. This analyst sees EPS of $5.45, which is still a ways away from the required $7.08.\nIf it continues that growth trajectory, Nvidia will reach the mark around fiscal 2029, which is about four and a half years away. While that's not a double in a year, that performance would still beat the broader market, which tends to double about every seven years.\nNvidia isn't doubling anytime soon, but that doesn't mean it can't be a solid investment now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Deservedly so. It\u2019s tense. We\u2019re trying to do the best we can.\u201d\nHuang\u2019s company is experiencing strong demand for its latest generation of chips, called Blackwell, he told the audience. The Santa Clara, California-based business outsources the physical production of its hardware, and Nvidia\u2019s suppliers are making progress in catching up, he said.\nNvidia\u2019s chips are used by data center operators to develop and run artificial intelligence models.

But geopolitical tension has raised risks. China sees TSMC\u2019s home island as a rogue province, stoking concerns that it might try to reclaim the territory. That could potentially cut off Nvidia from the key supplier.\nHuang said he develops much of the company\u2019s technology in-house and that should allow Nvidia to switch orders to alternative suppliers. Still, such a change would likely result in a reduction in quality of his chips, he said.\nTSMC\u2019s \u201cagility and their capability to respond to our needs is just incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we use them because they\u2019re great, but if necessary, of course, we can always bring up others.\u201d\n(Updates with stock performance in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool\nCollege Football Players Learn an Ugly Truth About Getting Paid\nIsraeli Budget Brawl Shows Gaza War Splintering the Nation\nEV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots\nThe Vegas Sphere\u2019s First Live Sporting Event Will Be an Expensive One\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia Just Made a 147% Profit Betting on This AI Stock",
        "Author": "  Ryan Vanzo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's difficult to make a 147% return in a matter of months, but that's what Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) achieved with a multimillion-dollar investment this year. The investment was one of many AI companies Nvidia decided to back. All were companies that it has worked with in the past, so it presumably knows them quite well. Despite the huge profit, Nvidia appears to be holding on to its fairly recent stock purchases. Investors looking for maximum growth should consider jumping in.\nLess than a year ago, Nvidia plowed $3.7 million into SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) stock. Shares have risen by 147% since then, but there's reason to believe they could rise another 10 times in value over the long term. But before you invest, there are a few things you need to consider.\nAt its core, SoundHound AI is a company focused on bringing AI to everything sound-related. From voice assistants to drive-thru ordering, anytime you chat with a speaker, SoundHound AI wants its technology to be there. With more than a decade in operation, the company has amassed more than 200 patents and an impressive customer list that has continued to grow.\nIn 2022, for example, it signed a seven-year contract with Hyundai to power its voice-driven AI capabilities. Drivers will be able to chat with their vehicles not only to send messages, get directions, or toggle the air conditioning but also to check in on maintenance issues and discuss how the vehicle has been performing. It's impressive stuff. Over the next few years, that giant user manual sold with new cars could be replaced with a simple conversation -- one conducted directly between you and the vehicle.\nSoundHound AI has signed several vehicle manufacturers as customers. But it's also in other industries, including restaurants and fast-food chains. Applebee's and White Castle, for instance, are piloting the technology to improve order times and reduce overhead costs. This is perhaps one of the most popular ways we will all be interacting with AI technologies in the near future.\nDespite its sizable tech portfolio, growing customer base, and sizable end markets -- not to mention Nvidia's backing -- SoundHound's market cap remains just under $2 billion. To rise 1,000% in value, the company would need to reach a valuation of around $20 billion. That's not much of a stretch in the volatile AI industry, which could be one of the largest growth opportunities in a generation.\nShares trade at a price of 22 times sales, but over the last two years, revenue has grown by more than 150%. If it can replicate these growth rates, shares would trade between 5 and 6 times 2026 revenue. That's a much more palatable valuation, although it will take some patience and execution to get there.\nClearly, SoundHound AI's end markets alone would support a $20 billion valuation. According to management, the voice AI market has a total addressable market size of at least $140 billion. SoundHound AI's unique technology can be used across a variety of industries, and its early head start bodes well for its ability to capture a growing share of an otherwise growing opportunity.\nBut there's a reason SoundHound still trades at a paltry $1.7 billion market cap. The company remains unprofitable, meaning it continually needs to seek financing in order to stay solvent. This limits its ability to invest in research and development, which is perhaps its most valuable use of funds long term.\nResearch and development spending last year was only around $56 million -- a 30% reduction in its peak spending levels in 2023. Big tech companies, including Apple and Alphabet, are investing billions of dollars in this space. Long-term competition will be intense, and it's not clear whether SoundHound AI has the capital to survive, let alone thrive.\nIf you're looking for a speculative growth stock with huge long-term potential, SoundHound AI could be for you. Nvidia's backing is certainly a plus. But volatility should remain high, and the potential downside is sizable as well.

        "Text": "Nvidia has led the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) higher this year amid frenetic interest in artificial intelligence (AI). The stock has surged 136% since January, and Wall Street analysts forecast median upside of 30% from the current share price of $115. But betting on a single AI stock is a bad strategy.\nConsultancy PwC estimates AI will add more than $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and numerous companies will benefit as the technology diffuses through different industries. So, rather than focusing solely on Nvidia, investors should forget the chipmaker (temporarily) and consider server maker Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI).\nSuper Micro has a 10-for-1 stock split scheduled for late September, such that shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on Oct. 1. Two analysts, Nehal Chokshi at Northland Securities and Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt Securities, value Super Micro at $1,300 per share, implying 195% upside from its current share price of $440.\nHere's what investors should know.\nSuper Micro develops accelerated computing platforms, including storage systems and servers, for enterprise and cloud data centers. Its portfolio includes individual devices, and full server racks optimized for workloads like data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). What sets Super Micro apart are its internal manufacturing capabilities and its modular approach to product development.\nSpecifically, the company uses electronic \"building blocks\" that can quickly be assembled into a broad range of servers. It also handles most assembly and testing at internal facilities to enable rapid prototyping and product releases. That usually allows Super Micro to bring new technologies to market two to six months before its competitors, according to CEO Charles Liang.\nHans Mosesmann highlighted that advantage in a note earlier this year. \"Super Micro has developed a model that is very, very quick to market. They usually have the widest portfolio of products when a new product comes out from Nvidia or AMD or Intel.\" That advantage has helped Super Micro secure a leadership position in the AI server market.\nThat puts the company in an enviable position. Statista estimates AI server sales will grow at 30% annually through 2033 as businesses build out their AI infrastructure. If Super Micro can maintain its time-to-market advantage, its revenue and earnings could increase at a similar pace over the next decade.\nSuper Micro reported mixed financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended June 2024). Revenue increased 144% to $5.3 billion, but gross margin contracted almost six percentage points to 11.2% and non-GAAP earnings increased 78% to $6.25 per diluted share. Investors interpreted weak margins has proof of increased competition in the AI server market.\nHowever, management attributed the issue to costs associated with direct liquid cooling (DLC) components. Importantly, the company expects gross margin to normalize between 14% and 17% before the end of fiscal 2025 as DLC solutions ship in higher volume. Moreover, investments in DLC solutions could strengthen Super Micro's position in the AI server market. Liquid cooling is more efficient than traditional air cooling, and it will become increasingly important as AI servers become more powerful.\nEven so, the stock tumbled 20% following the fourth-quarter report due to concerns about contracting margins. And shares moved even lower in late August when short-seller Hindenburg Research targeted Super Micro with allegations of \"glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures and customer issues.\" Shortly thereafter, Super Micro delayed filing its Form 10-K and several analysts downgraded the stock due to uncertainty arising from the situation.\nHowever, CEO Charles Liang dismissed the Hindenburg report as containing \"false or inaccurate statements about our company including misleading presentations of information that we have previous shared publicly.\" He also wrote, \"We don't anticipate any material changes in our fourth quarter or fiscal year 2024 financial results. This is good news. I continue to have strong confidence in our finance and internal teams.\"\nInvestors should stay informed on the situation. In the past, Hindenburg has uncovered serious wrongdoing at certain companies, but other times its reports have ultimately been inconsequential. Either way, the allegations make the stock risky right now, despite being down 63% from its high.\nWall Street expects Super Micro's adjusted earnings to grow at 41% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends June 2026). That makes the current valuation of 20 times earnings look cheap. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 0.5, a material discount to the three-year average of 0.9. But Super Micro stock also looks cheap compared to rival server maker Dell Technologies, which has a PEG ratio 1.7.\nPersonally, I think risk tolerant investors should consider buying a small position in Super Micro today. The stock could rebound in a big way if the short report amounts to nothing and the company's gross margin expands in the coming quarters. That said, shares could decline much further if either of those situations go the wrong way.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, AT&T Inc. T, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, Steel Partners Holdings L.P. SPLP and Natural Resource Partners L.P. NRP.\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nTop Stock Reports for NVIDIA, AT&T and Lockheed Martin\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp., AT&T Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corp., as well as two micro-cap stocks Steel Partners Holdings L.P. and Natural Resource Partners L.P.. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\nNVIDIA shares have lost some ground following the beat-and-raise quarterly release on Wednesday, August 28th, with market participants seemingly shrugging the company's raised guidance. But this lack of stock market follow through for the shares could very well be a reflection of the stock's impressive gains over the past year rather than a comment on underlying business trends.\nThe company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\nHowever, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds. The United States and China's tit-for-tat trade war is also a major concern.\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\nShares of AT&T have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the year-to-date period (+23.4% vs. +21.7%). The company is expected to benefit from an integrated fiber expansion strategy that improves broadband connectivity, while steady 5G deployments are likely to boost end-user experience. The deployment of O-RAN architecture is likely to offer more flexibility, lower costs and monetize the network to reduce the huge debt burden.\nWith a customer-centric business model, AT&T is witnessing healthy momentum in its postpaid wireless business with a lower churn rate and increased adoption of higher-tier unlimited plans. However, lower demand for legacy voice and data services is affecting revenues in the Business Wireline vertical.\nDeclining Mobility equipment sales are a concern. Fierce competition in a saturated wireless market will likely strain margins. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome while high debt burden remains a perennial problem.\n(You can read the full research report on AT&T here >>>)\nLockheed Martin shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+29.1% vs. +1.9%). The company's broad product offerings allow it to secure major defense contracts, which in turn boosts its backlog count. Lockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs.\nThe solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Its products also witness a strong international demand from countries like Germany, Taiwan, Japan and Australia. Meanwhile, the company also holds a strong solvency position.\nHowever, Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products that may affect its results. Shortage of skilled labor may adversely impact the company's operating results. The sanctions imposed by China on Lockheed might also affect its business.\n(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here >>>)\nShares of Steel Partners' have declined -2.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Diversified Operations industry's decline of -7%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $795.34 million reported strong financial results in second-quarter 2024, with revenues growing 6.4% year over year to $533.2 million and a 113.2% surge in net income to $124.9 million.\nRevenues for the six months ended Jun 30, 2024 also increased by 6.7% to $1 billion. This growth reflects the company's effective diversification across its industrial and financial services segments. SPLP's operational efficiency is highlighted by a 15.7% adjusted EBITDA margin, up from 14.7% in second-quarter 2023.\nSteel Partners' balance sheet is robust, with $256.4 million in cash and a $112-million debt reduction in the first half of 2024, enhancing financial stability. Investments in the Supply Chain segment, which saw 192% in revenues for the six months ended Jun 30, 2024, position SPLP for long-term growth, particularly as global supply chains evolve.\n(You can read the full research report on Steel Partners here >>>)\nNatural Resource Partners'shares have declined -0.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Coal industry's decline of -2.4%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $1.13 billion faces significant risks from its heavy reliance on coal royalties, with metallurgical coal accounting for 75% of second-quarter 2024 coal royalty revenues.\nWeakened steel demand, particularly in China and Europe, is pressuring coal prices, potentially reducing NRP's cash flow. The secular decline in U.S. thermal coal demand, driven by environmental regulations and competition from natural gas, further threatens long-term revenues.\nAdditionally, a surge in Chinese soda ash production is depressing global prices, impacting NRP's profitability. Inflationary pressures, labor shortages, and high financing costs also pose challenges, while stringent environmental regulations and reliance on lessees increase operational risks. Overall, NRP's exposure to volatile coal markets and regulatory risks positions it in a challenging environment.\n(You can read the full research report on Natural Resource Partners here >>>)\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

The second quarter of 2024 saw a surge in optimism among global markets, driven by the anticipation of a looser monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and the ongoing development prospects presented by artificial intelligence (AI). This positive outlook increased the S&P 500 by 4.3% for the quarter and 15.3% for the year, the Russell 1000 Growth (\u201cR1000G\u201d) by 8.3% for the quarter and 21.7% for the year, and the Dow decreasing by 1.7% for the quarter and increasing by 3.7% for the year. In the second quarter, the portfolio underperformed and returned 4.2% (gross of fees) compared to the Russell 1000 Growth\u2019s (R1G) 8.3% return.

In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\nIthaka US Growth Strategy highlighted stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute and networking solutions. The one-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 2.13%, and its shares gained 131.85% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On September 5, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $107.21 per share with a market capitalization of $2.63 trillion.\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\"\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in 5th position on our list of\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Apple Inc. AAPL and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nNVIDIA Corp. crushed bubble fears this year and its shares surged more than 100%. However, NVIDIA's stock price recently faced bouts of volatility after tech behemoths trimmed spending on artificial intelligence (AI) and the company's latest quarterly results failed to meet high expectations.\nBut it's also true that NVIDIA's newest stock buyback plan is expected to please income-oriented investors. So, is this the right time to buy the NVIDIA stock? Let's have a look \u2013\nNVIDIA hasn't tampered with its quarterly dividends, but it recently authorized a fresh $50 billion share repurchase. However, stock buybacks aren't new for NVIDIA. The company approved a $25 billion share repurchase in August 2023 and bought back stocks worth around $15.4 billion in the first half of its fiscal 2025.\nNVIDIA's board of directors can afford to repurchase shares as the company has generated significant cash flows. NVIDIA's new stock buyback plan is currently the third largest on the S&P 500. Apple Inc. has repurchased shares worth around $91 billion over the past year, while Alphabet Inc. has repurchased some $63 billion in shares, per FactSet.\nShare repurchases, in general, are an indication of a healthy corporate organization. This is because share repurchases lead to a decrease in the number of outstanding shares and an increase in the value of the remaining shares, which is a blessing for shareholders.\nNVIDIA's new $50 billion stock buyback and the remaining $7.5 billion share repurchase authorization may be less than 2% of the company's market capitalization. However, this shows that management is optimistic about NVIDIA's future business prospects.\nDo share prices go up after a stock buyback? The reduction in the number of outstanding shares often leads to an uptick in share prices. So, it's expected that NVIDIA's shares should increase in the long run.\nIt's prudent for investors to ignore NVIDIA's $279 billion market capitalization rout on Tuesday since its shares are not down on isolation. The broader tech sector fell due to discouraging economic data. In reality, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average (DMA) year to date, signifying a long-term uptrend.\nBeing the worldwide leader in graphic processing units (GPUs) bodes well for NVIDIA. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, recently said that $1 trillion worth of data centers would migrate from central processing units (CPUs) to GPUs.\nNotably, the global GPU market size is projected to jump from $75.77 billion in 2024 to $1,414.39 billion by 2034 at a CAGR of 13.8%, according to Precedence Research.\nNVIDIA's strong positioning in the AI field should help its shares scale upward. MarketsandMarkets stated that the AI industry is estimated to expand from $214.6 billion in the current year to $1,339.1 billion by 2030.\nLaunch of the cutting-edge Blackwell AI chips later this year would eventually squash any skepticism about NVIDIA. This is because Blackwell is more than just a GPU, its infrastructure platform can offer more AI throughput than the current Hopper platform.\nNVIDIA's initiatives to enter the ever-growing gaming and industrial metaverse space are also a tailwind for the company. Hence, the $2.76 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA's earnings per share is up 73.6% from a year ago (read more: The Best Chip Stock Post NVIDIA Earnings: NVDA, AMD, or INTC?).\nFundamentally, NVIDIA has been able to generate profits more proficiently. After all, NVIDIA stock's return on equity (ROE) is nearly 120%, while the Semiconductor-General industry's is 73.2%. An ROE above 100% shows that the company's net income is greater than its equity or that the company's performance is very strong.\nDespite the positives, buying NVIDIA's shares may burn a hole in your wallet. The voracious demand for AI models and supremacy in the GPU market has made the NVIDIA stock pricey.\nThis is because, per the price/earnings ratio, NVIDIA stock currently trades at 43.2X forward earnings. However, NVIDIA's rivals or the peer group's forward earnings multiple is 18.2X.\nThus, investors should wait for the right entry point and buy on the dip. Those who have invested in NVIDIA should hang on to it since the stock is for the future, as AI is the next big thing in the technology space (read more: 2 AI Stocks That Can Be the Next NVIDIA).\nNVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 20 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Micron Technology, Inc. MU.\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates aggressively and penciled in further rate cuts by the end of the year. It slashed the benchmark interest rate by a half-point to 4.75-5% for the first time since March 2020.\nInterest rates have been hovering at a 23-year high to combat relentless price pressures. However, signs of inflationary pressure have ebbed recently, giving the Fed all the more reason to cut interest rates aggressively and let investors know that the central bank is not behind the curve.\nA lower interest rate scenario may lead to stock gains for major artificial intelligence (AI) tech players like NVIDIA Corp., Microsoft Corp. \u00a0and Micron Technology, Inc. This is because interest rate cuts reduce their borrowing costs and boost profit margins. Interest rate cuts also don\u2019t disrupt the cash flows needed for growth initiatives to enhance shareholder\u2019s wealth.\nBy the way, the euphoria about the AI revolution hasn\u2019t faded. It\u2019s here to stay and should drive the prices of NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron northward. After all, NVIDIA provides technology for AI applications, Microsoft builds AI resources for its customers and Micron is a memory specialist. AI\u2019s data centers require a lot of memory.\nAccording to Statista, the AI industry is expected to grow beyond $184 billion in 2024 and continue to expand until 2030, with an estimated market size of $826 billion (read more: What AI Bubble? NVIDIA & 2 Other Chip Stocks With Strong Price Upside).\nEven so, let\u2019s look at other reasons why NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron\u2019s shares have more room to run.\nAccording to CEO Jensen Huang, as huge chunks of data are transferred from the central processing units to graphic processing units (GPU), NVIDIA will gain due to its bulk share in the GPU market. Precedence Research noted that the GPU market is expected to grow to $1,414.39 billion in 2034 from $75.77 billion in the current year at a CAGR of 13.8%.\nSince developers rely more on the CUDA software platform than AMD's ROCm software platform, NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs have a wide competitive moat. NVIDIA\u2019s data center GPU business revenues were $26.2 billion in the second quarter, up 154% year over year. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.80 for NVDA\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) is up 76.1% from the prior year (read more: NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?).\n\u00a0\nMicrosoft\u2019s Azure and cloud services business has picked up steam, with revenues from this segment increasing 29% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud infrastructure unit is expanding faster than Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has dominated the cloud computing market for quite some time.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Azure could soon overtake AWS since it has grown from half the size of AWS in 2019 to about three quarters now. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.04 for MSFT\u2019s EPS is up 5% year over year (read more: Microsoft Unveils $60 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy MSFT Stock?).\nIncreasing demand for Micron\u2019s high-bandwidth memory chips (HBM) has led the company to use its full production capacity and is expected to boost the bottom line. Management noted that revenues from the HBM market are estimated to be $86 billion by 2030 from $1.8 billion last year.\nNVIDIA\u2019s AI graphic cards also use Micron\u2019s HBM chips, so the demand is expected to improve. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 for MU\u2019s EPS is up 160.3% on a year-over-year basis (read more: Death Cross for MU Stock: Time to Buy Micron Based on Fundamentals?).\nGiven the positives, well-known brokers have jacked up the average short-term price target of NVDA by 28.8% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $115.59. Analysts\u2019 highest price target is $200, an upside of 73%.\nProminent brokers have also increased MSFT\u2019s average short-term price target by 14.8% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $435.15. The highest price target is $600, an upside of 37.9%.\nMU\u2019s average short-term price target, too, has been raised 74.4% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $88.73. The highest price target is $225, an upside of 153.6%.\nOver the past year, the shares of NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron have soared 168.4%, 34.3%, and 25.4%, respectively.\nAll these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Author": "  Hope C ",
        "Text": "Nvidia, the world's leading manufacturer of AI-specific computer chips, experienced its most significant single-day loss in market capitalization on September 3, 2024. The tech giant saw over $280 billion wiped from its value following reports of an antitrust subpoena issued by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ).\nNvidia's shares plummeted 9.53%, closing at $108, and continued to slide in after-hours trading, losing a further 2.42% to reach a low of $105. This unprecedented $278 billion loss in market value marks the largest single-day decline for any stock in U.S. market history.\nThe catalyst for this dramatic downturn was a Bloomberg report revealing that the DOJ had served Nvidia and several other companies with subpoenas as part of an ongoing antitrust investigation. This legal action represents an escalation from previous non-binding questionnaires, suggesting that the government may be preparing to file a formal complaint against the chipmaker.\nAt the heart of the DOJ's concerns are allegations that Nvidia might be engaging in practices that make it challenging for businesses to switch to other AI and computer chip providers. There are also suggestions that the company may have penalized buyers who don't exclusively use its AI services.\nAs part of its probe, the DOJ has reportedly reached out to other tech firms, including Microsoft, Nvidia's largest investor, for additional information. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has defended the company's practices, explaining that priority is given to customers who utilize Nvidia products in ready-to-go data centers. Huang maintains that this approach is designed to prevent stockpiling and accelerate the deployment of Nvidia's technology.\nCrypto AI tokens experienced a significant decline, amidst a wider market rout. Near Protocol (NEAR) fell 7.1% in the past 24 hours, while Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) declined by 7.5%.\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Top Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell.\u00a0Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nCommenting on the aggressive rate cut by the Federal Reserve, Jim Cramer said in a latest program on CNBC that the \u201cdouble\u201d rate cut was needed for the economy and it would help the housing market, industrials and companies catering to the \u201cless well-off\u201d households.\n\u201cThere really are two economies in this country. There is the one that needs lower interest rates because business is slowing and it\u2019s harder to find a job and then there is one that says we don\u2019t really care about where the stinking rates are. That\u2019s who we can get a double rate cut today and still going lower.\u201d\nCramer said he is currently in Silicon Valley and after talking to many companies, he feels tech companies do not care about interest rates since they are selling to businesses. Cramer said these technology companies are focused on innovation.\nFor this article, we picked 10 stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about during his latest programs on CNBC. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about what he called the \u201ccomplication\u201d around understanding NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) technologies and plans.\nCramer said some people believe there is a \u201cslowdown\u201d around Nvidia, but he rejected that notion.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true. There is no slowdown. What there is is a complication,\u201d Cramer said.\nCramer specifically read a sentence from a latest release from Oracle about the company\u2019s partnership with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) to explain what is the complication:\n\u201cNew AI supercomputer, the largest in the cloud, to deliver up to 131,072 NVIDIA GPUs to enable customers to build, train, and inference AI at scale.\u201d\nCramer said this sentence went \u201cover his head\u201d and he is trying to understand what that means.\n\u201cWe are now in the moment where NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is too hard for people to understand and we need Jensen to explain it\u2026 So I\u2019d say we are at a moment of confusion with Nvidia, not a moment of slowdown,\u201d Cramer added.\nNvidia\u2019s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\nAt Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\nOf course, Nvidia won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Top Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. TSMC",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Semiconductor giants Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) have delivered stellar gains so far in 2024 as both companies benefit from the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips that both companies specialize in.\nNvidia's stock is up 115% this year, while TSMC's gains are just under 55%. The interesting thing to note here is that Nvidia is a fabless semiconductor company, which means that it only designs its chips. It outsources the manufacturing of its chips to foundries such as TSMC.\nWhile Nvidia is considered the top player in the AI chip market, it utilizes TSMC's foundries for its chip manufacturing. Nvidia was TSMC's second-largest customer last year, accounting for 11% of the Taiwan-based foundry giant's revenue. This may lead investors to believe that TSMC's fortunes are dependent on Nvidia's.\nDoes that mean Nvidia is the better AI stock of the two? Let's find out.\nNvidia's financial metrics for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (the three months ended July 28) make it clear that it is the dominant player in the AI chip market. The company's quarterly revenue jumped 122% year over year to a record $30 billion. Its data center segment produced a record $26.3 billion in revenue for the company, an increase of 154% from the same quarter last year.\nGrowth like this puts the company way ahead of rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, which reported $2.8 billion in data center revenue in its latest quarter, a jump of 115% year over year. Nvidia's data center business is leagues ahead of AMD's and it is growing at a faster pace despite having a larger revenue base. A key reason Nvidia is able to generate that level of growth is because of TSMC.\nThe Taiwanese foundry expects to increase its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) advanced packaging capacity by 150% in 2024 to satisfy the growing demand for Nvidia's chips. What's more, TSMC is reportedly going to double its CoWoS capacity once again next year. As it turns out, Nvidia is among the companies that have fully booked TSMC's advanced packaging lines until 2025. More importantly, its data center revenue indicates that TSMC is probably allocating a lion's share of its AI chip manufacturing capacity to Nvidia.\nSo, the improvement in TSMC's output should directly translate into strong growth for Nvidia, especially considering that the demand for its upcoming Blackwell chips exceeds supply. It is also worth noting that the supply of Nvidia's current generation Hopper chips has improved. Even better, the company expects shipments of AI chips based on the Hopper architecture to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025 even though it is set to begin the production of its next-generation Blackwell chips in fiscal Q4.\nAll this indicates that Nvidia's AI chips enjoy solid pull among customers, leaving very little for rivals such as AMD. Not surprisingly, Nvidia expects another round of solid growth in the current quarter with an estimated revenue of $32.5 billion, which would be an increase of 80% from the same quarter last year. Analysts have also increased their growth expectations from Nvidia for the current fiscal year and the next one following its results.\nThe company's revenue is on track to more than double in fiscal 2025 from the previous fiscal year's level of $60.9 billion. The fiscal 2026 estimate suggests that its top line could jump another 40%. So, Nvidia has the potential to remain a top AI stock going forward thanks to its robust share of the lucrative AI semiconductor space.\nWe have already seen how TSMC is playing a central role in helping Nvidia remain the dominant player in the AI chip market. However, a closer look will tell us that it is probably a more influential player in AI chips than its illustrious client.\nThat's because Nvidia is just one of the companies for whom TSMC is manufacturing AI chips. The likes of Broadcom, Intel, AMD, and Marvell Technology also rely on TSMC's facilities to manufacture their chips. So, it doesn't matter for TSMC who the bigger player in the AI chip space is, as almost all the names mentioned above are fabless semiconductor companies (except Intel), which means that they will have to utilize the services of a foundry to make their chips.\nHowever, this is not the only way TSMC can capitalize on the AI market. Qualcomm and Apple also get their chips manufactured through TSMC, which puts the latter in a strong position to benefit from the secular growth in the smartphone and personal computer (PC) markets. So, TSMC gives investors a more diversified way to play the AI opportunity.\nInvestors should also note that TSMC's growth aggressively accelerated in 2024 because of AI. The company's revenue in the first seven months of 2024 increased by 30.5% from the same period in 2023. That's a strong comeback from 2023 when its top line fell almost 9% year over year to $69.3 billion.\nThe company is expected to finish 2023 with a 27% increase in revenue to $88.6 billion, followed by healthy increases over the next couple of years as well.\nSo, TSMC has the potential to remain a top AI stock going forward, just like Nvidia. But is it a better buy right now?\nThere is no doubt that Nvidia is growing at a much faster pace than TSMC. However, investors will have to pay a significant premium to buy shares of Nvidia right now. This is evident from the chart below.\nTSMC stock is cheaper than Nvidia, and we have already seen why it looks like the more diversified AI stock of the two. That's why long-term investors looking for a mix of growth and value should consider buying TSMC over Nvidia. But those with a higher appetite for risk can still consider going long on Nvidia stock as its AI chip dominance is likely to translate into more upside going forward.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is jumping Thursday following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. The company's share price was up 4.9% as of 3 p.m. ET.\nThe Fed announced yesterday that it would be cutting interest rates by 50 basis points -- coming in higher than the 25-basis-point cut that many investors and analysts had anticipated. While the initial reaction to the rate cut didn't spur gains for the broader market, investors quickly became more bullish after weighing the move from the central banking authority.\nInvestors have been eagerly awaiting a pivot to rate cuts as a potential bullish catalyst for the stock market and growth stocks in particular. After getting the chance to soak up some additional commentary on the economic outlook, investors are seeming more confident that inflation is under control and that the economy will avoid a recession in the near term.\nIf the economy stays relatively healthy and avoids contraction, the Fed's shift to rate cutting could help pave the way for a new bull rally that spurs big gains for Nvidia stock. Of course, there's still significant uncertainty on that front, and additional risk factors including geopolitical tensions could inject new bearish sentiment despite the rate cut.\nBut while investors shouldn't take the rate policy pivot as a clear indicator that Nvidia will continue to surge, the business is firing on all cylinders and continues to look like a worthwhile artificial intelligence (AI) stock for long-term investors. In addition to strong demand from hyperscale cloud companies and other large enterprises, Nvidia will likely see rising demand from government customers. The company has highlighted the importance of having \"sovereign AI\" as a key national priority for governments around the world, and spending from public sector customers is likely still in early stages of ramping up.\nNvidia also has major new product releases set to hit in the fourth quarter. The first of the company's Blackwell processors are expected provide major performance and power-consumption advantages compared to the company's current top-of-the line H200 processors.\nWith the release, customers will likely be able to get a dramatic improvement in the amount of processing power they're getting per dollar. But Nvidia will also be able to command a pretty penny with its next-gen processors thanks to the performance leaps that are expected to be delivered.\nThe Blackwell processors could help boost margins once released -- or the company could price the new hardware aggressively to stamp out opportunities for competitors. So while there's uncertainty about what moves the broader market will make in the near term, Nvidia's competitive positioning in AI continues to look very strong and opens the door for strong returns.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence has been the buzzword around Wall Street for many months but a recent selloff in the technology sector has ignited fears of an AI bubble. Investors are looking towards experts to help them make better investment decisions. In a recent commentary on the AI market, as well as the macro conditions surrounding the economy, the investment titan highlighted multiple factors contributing to market volatility, including recession concerns, pre-US election jitters, and profit-taking. Despite these, the investment firm noted, US corporate earnings have been resilient, with the S&P 500 showing 13% growth in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing expectations. The AI sector remained a key theme of this growth, but BlackRock relented that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech companies. In this environment, the investment firm recommended diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOverall, the wealth wizard advocated for broadening investment exposure beyond US tech stocks, particularly into sectors benefiting from ongoing AI buildout, while remaining cautious about Japanese equities and US short-term bonds. In the weekly commentary, the advisory highlighted that the US economy appeared more resilient than anticipated, with broad-based earnings growth suggesting stability. However, inflation remained a concern, and BlackRock expects it to limit how much the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates in the medium term. The investment firm noted that markets were pricing in significant rate cuts, but expectations seemed overblown given persistent inflation pressures, especially from wage growth. The investment titan suggested looking to European markets for income opportunities and remaining underweight on short-dated US Treasuries in favor of medium-term maturities and quality credit.\nThe investment firm also underlined the broader market backdrop in the weekly commentary, noting that US stocks fell due to recession fears, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest weekly drop in 18 months. Treasury yields also declined as investors priced in expected Fed rate cuts. The advisory, however, viewed these recession fears as overstated, pointing to US jobs data that showed slowing but steady employment growth. Analysts at the investment firm maintained that wage gains were unlikely to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target in the near term but cautioned that the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data would be crucial in determining inflation's trajectory. A surge in immigration had contributed to easing wage inflation, according to the financial firm's report, but the long-term labor supply trend would influence the Fed\u2019s ability to adjust rates.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company is positioned well for mid-teens returns in the coming months due to a variety of factors, including strong AI chip demand, reasonable valuation, and robust earnings growth. The stock price has dropped amid a broader sell off in the tech sector, offering a buying opportunity for shrewd investors who have noticed that the P/E ratio of the firm is now in line with peers in the tech world, even as NVIDIA offers better growth prospects. An important catalyst that might spur the shares is the launch of Blackwell chips, possibly in the fourth quarter, driving strong demand from companies looking towards AI advancements.\nWall Street analysts are also overwhelmingly bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Bank of America has a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of 165. In a recent investor note, the advisory named NVIDIA as the top sector pick, highlighting that near-term headwinds for the company could potentially create an enhanced buying opportunity with the stock trading within the lowest quartile of valuation in the past five years, even as it offers compelling growth at a compelling valuation.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the most important AI stocks according to BlackRock. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Aside From Nvidia, There Is 1 Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That Stands Above the Rest. The Reason Why May Surprise You.",
        "Author": "  Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It seems everyone wants to talk about the \"Magnificent Seven.\" They're seven of the largest and most important stocks around: Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla.\nThey've all, in their own ways, been excellent stocks to own. However, over the last 20 months, two have separated themselves from the pack. One is Nvidia; the other might come as a surprise.\nFirst, let's cover how the Magnificent Seven stocks have performed since the start of 2023. Given the absolute explosion in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) systems over the last few years, it's no surprise that Nvidia is the top-performing stock in the Magnificent Seven. However, it might be a surprise to see how far ahead Meta Platforms is, compared to the rest.\nSetting Nvidia to the side, Meta has dominated the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Over the last 20 months, shares of Meta increased by 334%. That's about 3 times as much as Amazon, the next best Mag 7 stock, with a gain of 113%.\nSo, what's driving this divergence between Meta and the rest of the Magnificent Seven?\nFor starters, let's cover what Meta does and how it makes money. The company operates social networks like Facebook and Instagram. It sells ad space on those platforms to advertisers, generating about $150 billion per year in revenue.\nThat contrasts with most of the other companies in the Magnificent Seven. Apple, for example, relies on iPhone sales and, to a lesser extent, services revenue. Microsoft is a technology conglomerate with a large cloud services business, an iconic software segment, and a large gaming unit. Amazon operates the world's largest cloud services provider, along with a massive e-commerce segment. Tesla sells electric vehicles.\nOnly Alphabet operates in the same orbit as Meta with its Google Search and YouTube businesses. Yet, even with Alphabet, there are significant differences. Alphabet makes a ton of money from ad revenue, but it makes it by selling ads through its search functionality, rather than through a social media feed like Facebook or Instagram.\nThe big difference, however, emerges when you look at a very important metric: free cash flow.\nAs you can see above, both Alphabet and Meta expanded their free cash flow in impressive fashion over the last 10 years. Yet, over the last 18 months, Meta has truly separated itself. There are a few reasons for that.\nFirst, Meta is growing at a breakneck pace. In its most recent quarter (the three months ended June 30), Meta reported revenue growth of 22%. That's nearly double the pace of Alphabet, which grew at 13% over the same period.\nSecond, Meta is scaling back some expensive projects. Spending on the company's Reality Labs, the segment tasked with building the company's version of the metaverse, is set to fall by around 20% this year.\nFinally, setting aside its revenue growth and cost-cutting, Meta's business is just extremely profitable. As shown below, it ranks third among Mag 7 businesses, behind Nvidia and Microsoft.\nMETA Operating Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts\nGranted, Meta Platforms isn't a stock for every investment portfolio. While the stock now pays a dividend, the stock's 0.4% dividend yield is hardly enough to satisfy value investors or those who need to generate significant sums of income from their investments. Nevertheless, Meta is an excellent stock -- particularly for investors who can hold the stock for years and benefit from its growing sales and free cash flow. For those reasons, Meta is an excellent stock that most investors should strongly consider.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock vs. Palantir Stock: Wall Street Says Buy One and Sell the Other",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine ",
        "Text": "Consultancy PwC estimates artificial intelligence (AI) will contribute more than $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Investors hoping to benefit are piling into AI stocks, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) have been two of the most popular choices.\nIn the last two years, Nvidia shares surged 728%, and Palantir shares advanced 348%. But Wall Street analysts expect the stocks to move in opposite directions over the next 12 months, as detailed below:\nNvidia's median target of $150 per share implies 26% upside from its current share price of $119.\nPalantir's median target of $28 per share implies 20% downside from its current share price of $35.\nHere's what investors should know about these AI stocks.\nNvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that have become the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads such as training machine learning models and running AI applications. In March, Forrester Research wrote, \"Nvidia sets the pace for AI infrastructure worldwide. Without Nvidia GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\nHowever, the chipmaker is truly formidable because it provides a full-stack computing platform that comprises adjacent hardware, software, and services. Nvidia has secured leadership in generative AI networking gear, and its first server central processing unit (CPU) is ramping toward a multibillion-dollar product line, according to CEO Jensen Huang.\nLikewise, Nvidia says its software and services business will approach a $2 billion revenue run rate this year due to strength from its AI Enterprise offering. Nvidia AI Enterprise is a software platform that streamlines data preparation and model training, as well as the development and deployment of AI applications. The platform includes frameworks that address specific use cases, including conversational agents, recommender systems, and autonomous robotics.\nNvidia reported strong financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended July 2024). Revenue increased 122% to $30 billion on strong demand for AI hardware and software, and non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings surged 152% to $0.68 per diluted share. More importantly, the company is well positioned to maintain that momentum.\nNvidia's next generation of data center GPUs, called Blackwell, will ramp up later this year, and the market is rife with anticipation. Earlier this year, CEO Jensen Huang predicted, \"The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history.\"\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to grow at 49% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends January 2026). That estimate makes the current valuation of 54 times adjusted earnings seem reasonable. Patient investors should consider purchasing a small position in Nvidia stock today.\nPalantir sells data analytics software. Its platforms help enterprises manage data, develop machine learning models, and integrate those digital assets into applications that improve decision-making. Palantir describes its core software products, Foundry and Gotham, as operating systems that connect data, decisions, and operations. Use cases range from managing supply chains to mitigating financial risk to optimizing manufacturing.\nLast year, Palantir added support for large language models and generative AI to Gotham and Foundry with AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform). The company also reoriented its go-to-market strategy around the new product with AIP Bootcamps, instructional events where potential customers learn to use AIP on their own data in a matter of days.\nIn August, Forrester Research recognized Palantir as a leader among AI and machine learning platform vendors. Analysts wrote, \"Palantir is quietly becoming one of the largest players in this market.\" Palantir was awarded the highest score for its current product offering, but competitors Alphabet and C3.ai earned higher scores for their growth strategy.\nPalantir reported encouraging financial results in the second quarter. Its customer count increased by 41% to 593, and the average customer spent 14% more over the past year. In turn, revenue increased 27% to $678 million, the fifth sequential acceleration, and non-GAAP net income jumped 80% to $0.09 per diluted share.\nGoing forward, CEO Alex Karp expects the company to maintain its momentum. \"The persistent and unbridled demand for our software, for an effective enterprise platform that makes artificial intelligence capabilities useful to large institutions, shows no signs of relenting.\"\nThe problem is valuation. Wall Street forecasts adjusted earnings growth of 22% annually through 2025. That makes the current valuation of 109 times adjusted earnings look pricey. Personally, I agree with Wall Street. Palantir looks overvalued, and I would not be surprised to see a substantial correction in the future. Investors should consider trimming their positions.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia's CEO Has Sold Shares Virtually Every Trading Session Since Mid-June. Should Investors Follow Suit and Sell?",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Since the middle of June, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang has been selling shares of his company's stock during basically every trading session. That leads to an obvious question: If the company's CEO is dumping shares, should you be selling your shares, too?\nLet's dive into Huang's trades and see whether this could be a signal -- or not -- to sell the stock.\nHuang is selling his Nvidia shares through what's known as a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which is designed to allow company insiders to sell shares without being accused of illegally trading on material non-public information. Through these plans, company insiders give brokers set parameters as to when the insider wants them to sell shares. This can be based on certain price triggers and/or dates and set up to sell a certain dollar amount or number of shares.\nOnce established, the broker executes the plan following a designated cooling-off period. Insiders can make changes to the plan, but only during open insider trading windows and if they have no material non-public information that could impact the stock price.\nHuang's current 10b5-1 plan was established in March and revealed in a 10-Q filing in May. He arranged to sell 6 million shares (600,000 pre-split) by the end of March 2025.\nThe parameters of Huang's plan are pretty straightforward, as he sells 120,000 Nvidia shares each trading day. His first trade was June 13, and it appears his plan is about to be wrapped up. Through his sales, Huang will have pocketed over $700 million in cash.\nYes, that's a lot of shares sold and a lot of cash, but it's just a drop in the bucket for Huang, who owns over 860 million shares of Nvidia, even after this recent selling. Basically, he sold less than 1% of the shares he owned.\nGiven the gains that Huang, who has been CEO at Nvidia since 1993, has seen, no one can blame him for selling some shares to gain liquidity. His wealth is still very much tied to Nvidia.\nThe answer to this question comes down to each individual's circumstances. If you've seen huge gains in the stock over the past few years and Nvidia has become an outsized portion of your portfolio, it can be good portfolio risk management to lock in some gains. After all, every investment comes with risk, and Nvidia is no exception.\nAt this point, the biggest risk the company faces is future demand. There are still questions as to whether demand for the company's graphic processing units (GPUs) will soon peak and eventually decline as the race for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure cools. This very well could come down to how much other companies start benefiting from AI in the areas of software and other industries, as the infrastructure players can't be the only AI winners or the spending will eventually stop.\nFor now, though, there doesn't appear to be any let up for AI infrastructure spending. Cloud-computing operators are increasing their capital expenditure (capex) budgets, and companies such as Alphabet and Meta Platforms have indicated that there's more risk in under-investing in AI infrastructure and falling behind than in over-investing.\nAt the same time, as AI models advance, they need exponentially more computing power, which comes from Nividua's GPUs. For example, xAI's Grok large language model (LLM) went from using 20,000 GPUs for its second iteration to needing 100,000 for its third iteration, while Alphabet's Llama 4 is projected to need 10x as many GPUs as Llama 3. Meanwhile, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison recently said there was no end in sight to the need for computing power for AI training when asked on the company's most recent earnings call if there would be a shift to less compute-intensive AI inference.\nWhile there's a risk that future demand could eventually dry up, the comments from Nvidia's customers indicate that this isn't going to happen anytime soon. Nvidia remains the best-positioned company in the AI infrastructure buildout.\nI think Nvidia's stock is attractively priced at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of about 29x next year's analyst estimates, given the robust growth still ahead, based on customers' comments. As such, I'm not worried by Huang's recent selling and would consider buying the stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "CEO Jensen Huang Sells Chunk of NVIDIA Stock, But Why You Shouldn't",
        "Author": "  Tirthankar Chakraborty ",
        "Text": "Wall Street darling NVIDIA Corporation NVDA saw its market capitalization climb to $2.61 trillion from $358 billion two years ago with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). However, NVIDIA stock\u2019s unparalleled surge this year hit a speed bump lately due to the violation of antitrust laws, and AI bubble qualms.\nMeanwhile, CEO Jensen Huang has sold NVIDIA\u2019s shares, which makes us wonder whether the chipmaker has the potential to increase shareholder wealth. Let\u2019s have a look \u2013\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filings revealed last week that Huang off-loaded more than $633 million of the chipmaker\u2019s stock since June. Huang has sold shares in tranches of 120,000 each from June 13 to Sept. 5, which accounts for almost 5.3 million shares.\nOn Friday, NVIDIA\u2019s shares posted their worst two-week stretch in two years, while the world\u2019s most sought-after AI player was subjected to wild price swings over the past month that dwarfed even the most volatile assets like cryptocurrency.\nGeopolitical tensions to legal issues plagued NVIDIA, with the stock witnessing a $279 billion wipeout in a single trading session last week. The U.S. Department of Justice subpoenaed NVIDIA in a mounting antitrust issue.\nDoes this sound depressing? Fear not; the NVIDIA stock has an upside potential, and remaining bullish would reap benefits in the long run.\u00a0 Here are the positive reasons \u2013\nInvestors are waiting for the rollout of the cutting-edge new Blackwell chips. However, engineering snags have delayed the process. NVIDIA has been addressing the design flaws in the Blackwell B200 chip and aims to launch it by the year-end. So, the delay period is not long enough to impact the NVIDIA stock\u2019s 2025 results.\nMicrosoft Corporation MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Meta Platforms, Inc. META have already ordered Blackwell chips worth billions of dollars, and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN is expected to move from Hopper to Blackwell.\nNVIDIA confirmed that the demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply and may continue into the next fiscal year. After all, the Blackwell platform has more AI throughput than the current Hopper platform. The new Blackwell graphic processing unit (GPU) has greater processing power, which is the most pressing need. It holds 208 billion transistors, way more than the 80 billion in the present H100 CHIP. Also, Blackwell\u2019s NVLink offers high-speed communication, which is the need of the hour.\nThus, strong demand for the Blackwell chip is expected to boost the NVIDIA stock following its launch. Lest we forget, NVIDIA\u2019s shares surged by double digits in the three months following the launch of two previous architectures \u2014 Hopper in the fall of 2022 and Ampere in the spring of 2020.\nIn the dot-com bubble, companies\u2019 shares scaled upward based on hype before the real impact of their business models could be felt. However, AI has become an integral part of all businesses. According to Markets and Markets, the AI industry is poised to expand from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion in 2030.\nNVIDIA is well-poised to make the most of the flourishing AI industry since its chips are essential for AI models deployed across several verticals, including cloud computing. This explains why the company\u2019s H100 graphic cards have huge demand in the AI chip market. Moreover, unlike the stocks in the Internet bubble, NVIDIA has solid fundamentals that validate the company\u2019s stretched valuations, and squash bubble fears.\nNVIDIA has generated profits competently since its return on equity (ROE) is almost 120%, which is way higher than the Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s 73.2%. Notably, any ROE above 100% shows that the company\u2019s net income is more than its equity, or the performance is strong.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA\u2019s net profit margin is 55%, above the industry\u2019s 47.6%. Any net margin of 20% indicates the company can curtail costs and generate profits.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhat\u2019s more, NVIDIA recently approved a stock buyback worth $50 billion, indicating a healthy corporate organization. Share repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares and increase the value of the remaining shares, which bodes well for shareholders (read more: NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?).\nBeing the worldwide leader in GPUs, NVIDIA\u2019s stock will benefit. Huge data is expected to migrate from central processing units to GPUs, per Huang. According to Precedence Research, the GPU market will expand from $56.55 billion in 2023 to $1,414.39 billion by 2034.\nNVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with Siemens to enter the metaverse space and the introduction of GeForce in the growing gaming market will act as a tailwind for the company.

        "Text": "After reaching an important support level, Nvidia (NVDA) could be a good stock pick from a technical perspective. NVDA surpassed resistance at the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.\nThe 20-day simple moving average is a popular investing tool. Traders like this SMA because it offers a look back at a stock's price over a shorter period and helps smooth out price fluctuations. The 20-day can also show more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.\nSimilar to other SMAs, if a stock's price moves above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive, while price falling below the moving average can signal a downward trend.\nNVDA has rallied 11.3% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. This combination suggests NVDA could be on the verge of another move higher.\nThe bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account NVDA's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 7 revisions higher for the current fiscal year compared to none lower, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nInvestors may want to watch NVDA for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Wall Street Thinks Nvidia Stock Can Rise 30% in a Year. Time to Buy?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Wall Street analysts often have one-year price targets available for the stocks they cover. While a single analyst may have a high or low target, taking the aggregate yields useful information.\nThe average stock price target on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is $153, with a high of $200 and a low of $90. Nvidia's stock currently sits at around $120, which indicates a roughly 30% upside. So, with that kind of upside potential in store for Nvidia, is it time to buy?\nConsidering that the market returns 10% annually on average, if Nvidia can deliver 30% returns, then it's a no-brainer. It's that simple.\nBut it's never that simple.\nNvidia's meteoric rise has been tethered to the massive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing power. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) excel in this task, and Nvidia's GPUs far outperform its competitors. It's clear that the demand for AI will continue rising, but the question is, will the thirst for computing power be there?\nEventually, the tech giants will reach equilibrium with AI demand and the computing power they have available. When that happens, there will be a large demand shock for Nvidia as its GPUs will not be nearly as sought after. But the question is, will this occur in the quarter, year, or decade? Nobody knows the answer to that, but it seems like it will be at least a year later.\nCommentary from some of Nvidia's largest customers indicates that capital expenditures will ramp up in 2025, indicating its GPUs will still be in high demand.\nSo, demand will be there for at least 2025 (which the price target is good for). But has that growth already been baked into the stock?\nIt's no secret that Nvidia's stock has achieved a high valuation due to its expectations. Right now, it trades for 42 times forward earnings.\nThat's not a cheap price, and with a price in that range, it also projects further strong growth in the following years.\nHowever, one item to watch that could sink Nvidia's ship is its margins.\nA part of Nvidia's story that hasn't been discussed as much as the massive GPU demand is its margin expansion. Since its GPUs became hot commodities, its margins increased.\nHowever, they trended lower in the past few quarters, which could be noise or a cause for concern. Even if Nvidia's revenue continues to rise, if its margins revert to historical levels, its profits will be drastically reduced and cause the stock price to drop.\nSo, could Nvidia's stock rise 30% over the next 12 months? I'd say absolutely. And if it does, it'll be a fantastic stock to own. However, one item to watch during this time is its margins. If they start to slip, don't be surprised if the stock falls. I think Nvidia's margins will be fine through at least 2025, so now may be a good time to pick up some Nvidia shares while they are on sale.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Anton Shilov ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nDespite US export restrictions, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are easily accessible in China via the cloud. And that access is surprisingly cheaper in Tianxia than in the US, according to a report by\u00a0the Financial Times.\nFour small-scale Chinese providers offer 8-way Nvidia A100 servers at around 40% lower costs per hour than US cloud providers. FT believes that the availability of these GPUs points to widespread smuggling and a robust resale market in China.\nChinese cloud providers charge significantly lower rates for renting Nvidia AI chip-powered servers. Small companies in China charge about $6 per hour for servers using eight Nvidia A100 GPUs, while similar services in the U.S. cost about $10 per hour. This pricing disparity reflects the abundant supply of these GPUs in China despite U.S. efforts to limit their distribution in Tianxia.\nWhile small vendors in China can offer competitive prices using these smuggled Nvidia GPUs, larger companies like Alibaba and ByteDance charge higher rates. These major players, focused on compliance, avoid using illegally obtained GPUs. Their prices for Nvidia-powered servers range from double to quadruple what smaller firms charge, although they offer discounts that bring their rates in line with Amazon Web Services (AWS), which charges $15 to $32 per hour,\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0reports.\nNvidia\u2019s AI GPUs, particularly the A100 and H100 models, have been restricted from direct export to China since October 2022, which is why Nvidia invented A800 and H800 GPUs with fewer external connections to prevent building high-end supercomputers based on these GPUs.\u00a0Then, the U.S. restricted sales of A800 and H800 to Chinese entities in October 2023. Still, there are plenty of such GPUs in the country, as the report from Financial Times shows.\nNvidia\u2019s A100 is sold openly on Chinese platforms like Taobao and Xiaohongshu, often at slight markups from their prices outside of China. In Shenzhen\u2019s Huaqiangbei electronics market, H100 GPUs for AI and HPC are sold for prices ranging from $23,000 to $30,000. This is slightly higher than Nvidia\u2019s official pricing of $20,000 to $23,000 for these GPUs.\nNvidia\u2019s A100 and H100 GPUs are often brought into China from countries such as Japan, Malaysia, and Indonesia, with Hong Kong acting as a key transit hub. Companies are finding various ways to bypass U.S. export regulations. For example, Chinese firms may set up new entities in countries like Japan or Malaysia to acquire Nvidia GPUs and ship them back to China.\nSmugglers have even etched the serial numbers from GPUs to avoid detection by authorities. For obvious reasons, this black market access greatly undermines U.S. efforts to control China\u2019s use of cutting-edge technology.\nNvidia says it works with its direct partners to ensure compliance with U.S. export laws. However, the company acknowledges that it cannot track second-hand sales of its products.\n"

As of 11:40 a.m. ET, Nvidia shares were up by 5.3%. But it wasn't just the Fed rate cut that had investors pouring into Nvidia stock today.\nCEO Jensen Huang also just spoke on stage with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff at the Dreamforce annual technology gathering in San Francisco hosted by Salesforce. He noted that the AI movement is transitioning from an industry of tools to an industry of skills. Huang called the opportunity from here \"gigantic.\" His comments gave investors reason to believe that the huge run in Nvidia shares isn't over. Even with it well off its record level, Nvidia stock is still higher by over 140% year to date.\nLast week, after a meeting at the White House between top tech leaders and the Biden administration, Huang told reporters that a new industrial revolution is beginning.

        "Author": "  Lara Williams ",
        "Text": "Following Nvidia\u2019s earning release on 28 August 2024, the US chip giant\u2019s stock price slumped three percent. In the typical Wall Street playbook, this would indicate disappointing revenues or a downgraded financial forecast.\nHowever, Nvidia beat its own forecasts and Wall Street\u2019s own predictions, increasing revenue by 122% from $13.5bn to $30bn year-on-year. But by the end of that same week Nvidia saw around a fifth of its market cap wiped out with a loss $406bn.\nFurthermore, Apple's leading chip supplier, Broadcom, suffered a similar slump in stock price, dropping over 10% by the end of August, after having risen 37% year-to-date. In fact, 30 August saw the biggest single-day drop in stock value for the company since the beginning on the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.\nAs with Nvidia, Broadcom\u2019s fall in stock price, however dramatic, belies incredible growth and a projected company revenue of $12bn from AI-related products in 2024. Broadcom\u2019s chip design and networking semiconductors are critical to data centre providers that are building out their AI infrastructure to accommodate the AI boom.\nNvidia, too, has seen stratospheric growth over the last year based on its ability to supply advanced AI chips to fuel the surge in AI development more broadly. As the undisputed leader of the AI hype cycle, could Nvidia\u2019s stock slump now signal the end of the AI, ushering in a well-needed dose of reality?\nAccording to GlobalData analyst Steven Schuchart, the Nvidia stock slump signals rationality returning, especially outside of the Wall Street groupthink. \u201cBut it does beg the question \u2013 how much stock should enterprise buyers put into this increasingly pessimistic news cycle events around AI companies?\u201d he said.\nFor the enterprise buyer, that means due caution \u2013 don\u2019t invest in AI and AI technologies without a good use case \u2013 one that saves money/time or makes money, according to Schuchart. \u201cIt is rational to look at the AI frenzy and worry that things are moving too quickly, but this happens all the time in technology,\u201d added Schuchart.\nEnterprise technology decisions have far reaching consequences, are meant to last multiple years and be executed strategically, warned Schuchart. \u201cDon\u2019t let the tactical outlook of the stock market and financial pundits derail good technology strategy,\u201d he warned enterprise technology buyers,\" he said.\nGlobalData\u2019s Generative AI Q3 2024 research notes that the maturing GenAI market is increasingly facing accusations of \u201coverhype.\u201d As a move to guard against hype, vendors are now unveiling small language models (SLMs) with stronger business cases and demonstrable return on investment, according to GlobalData's research note, which adds that SLMs are easier to adopt, less expensive to run, and have a smaller carbon footprint.\n\u201cAs training techniques improve, SLMs with fewer parameters are becoming more accurate. They can be more easily trained and finetuned, making them an attractive option for companies that want to customise a language model. Since they utilise far less computing power than an LLM, they don\u2019t require a massive investment in expensive infrastructure,\u201d according to the note.\nNew SLMs of note, available to enterprise users, are SmolLM, Mistral-Nemo, and GPT-4o.

        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has been through a whirlwind of ups and downs in recent months. Its stock soared 188% during the first half of 2024 due to excitement about the company's increasingly important role in the artificial intelligence (AI) economy. That run-up helped Super Micro secure a spot in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) in March.\nTremendous share price appreciation also prompted Super Micro to schedule a 10-for-1 stock split for Sept. 30. The split will occur after the market closes, and shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on Oct. 1. Interestingly, fellow AI company Nvidia also reset its soaring share price with a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this year.\nHowever, Super Micro shares started falling when the company reported disappointing earnings in August. The sell-off worsened when Hindenburg Research accused it of wrongdoing later that month, and it worsened again following news of a Justice Department investigation this week. Shares are still up 35% year to date\u00a0and 470% since January 2023, but the stock is down 65% from its record high.\nHere's what investors should know.\nSuper Micro develops high-performance computing platforms optimized for applications like data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). Its portfolio includes subsystems, individual servers, and full server racks equipped with compute, networking, and storage to provide clients with a turnkey solution for data center workloads.\nWhat sets Super Micro apart are its manufacturing capabilities and modular approach to development. The company handles most production and testing internally at facilities in Silicon Valley, which supports rapid prototyping and product launches. Super Micro also uses common electronic building blocks to quickly assemble a broad range of products featuring the latest chips from suppliers like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel.\nRosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann highlighted those advantages in a note to clients. \"Super Micro has developed a model that is very, very quick to market. They usually have the widest portfolio of products when a new product comes out.\" Indeed, Super Micro CEO Charles Liang says the company typically beats competitors to market by two to six months.\nThat time-to-market advantage has helped Super Micro secure a leadership position in the AI server market. The company accounted for 10% of AI server sales in 2023, but that figure could reach 17% in 2026, according to Bank of America. That implies rapid revenue growth for Super Micro because AI server sales are forecasted to increase at 30% annually over the next 10 years, according to Statista.\nAdditionally, Super Micro also holds 70% to 80% market share in liquid-cooled servers, according to Charles Liang. Liquid cooling is more efficient that traditional air cooling, so the technology is expected to become increasingly popular as data center chips become increasingly powerful. Leadership in liquid cooling should reinforce Super Micro's strong presence in the AI server market.\nSuper Micro reported mixed financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended June 2024). Revenue increased 144% to $5.3 billion on strong demand for AI servers. But gross margin fell about six percentage points to 11.2%, so non-GAAP earnings increased just 78% to $6.25 per diluted share. Investors saw declining margins as a sign Super Micro's pricing power was waning due to increased competition.\nImportantly, management attributed margin contraction to the costly production ramp of direct liquid cooling (DLC) components. CFO David Weigand said, \"We had to ramp up our supply chain. We paid a lot of expedite costs and higher supply chain costs.\" The company expects its gross margin to return to historical levels (between 14% and 17%) by the end of fiscal 2025 as liquid cooling solutions begin shipping in higher volume.\nIn August, short-seller Hindenburg Research accused Super Micro of accounting manipulation and sanctions evasion. The analysts that authored the report claim to have uncovered \"glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.\"\nOf course, short sellers have a vested interest in seeing a stock decline, but Super Micro subsequently delayed filing its Form 10-K and many analysts downgraded the stock. Samik Chatterjee at JPMorgan Chase wrote, \"We see the report as largely void of details around alleged wrong doings.\" But he followed that insight with another note advising that new investors \"remain on the sidelines till the company is back in compliance.\"\nImportantly, Super Micro failed to file its Form 10-K for 2017 in a timely fashion. It took nearly two years for the company to correct the problem, during which it was temporarily delisted from the Nasdaq Exchange. The SEC ultimately fined Super Micro $17.5 million for recognizing revenue prematurely and understating expenses. So, the allegations made by Hindenburg come with an element of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nThe situation recently became more convoluted. On Sept. 26, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department is probing Super Micro. The impetus was a former employee who filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the company earlier this year. The lawsuit echoed certain allegations made by Hindenburg, including improper revenue recognition between 2020 and 2022. According to WSJ, the probe is at an early stage, and the situation could change rapidly as more news breaks.\nOn the whole, Wall Street views Super Micro stock as undervalued despite the recent wave of downgrades. The median price target of $635 per share implies 39% upside from its current share price of $458. Analysts anticipate Super Micro's adjusted earnings will increase at 41% annually over the next two years, which does indeed make the current valuation of 20.7 times adjusted earnings look cheap.\nHowever, that estimate could change as Wall Street unpacks the Justice Department's probe. Where the stock goes from here depends on how that situation unfolds, as well as Super Micro's ability to expand its gross margin. Given the uncertainty surrounding the company, I think investors should stay on the sidelines for now. But Nvidia remains a compelling stock to own.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has run circles around other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past few years thanks to its leadership in the field. The company holds an 80% share of the AI chip market, and that has helped it generate triple-digit revenue growth quarter after quarter. As a result, the stock soared more than 2,200% over the past five years.\nBy comparison, its other top technology peers, including Apple and Alphabet,\u00a0saw their shares rise in the double or triple digits during that period.\nThough I expect Nvidia to continue as a winning stock over time, from now until the end of the year another stock could step ahead. Investors have worried about Nvidia's dependence on AI revenue in an uncertain economy and the competition it faces in the chip market. In fact, Nvidia already has lost some momentum, falling 12% over the past three months.\nSo, investors could turn to another company that is benefiting from the AI boom but brings in billions of dollars in revenue from other businesses, too. This player might be more resilient through a difficult or uncertain economy, and my prediction is that this AI stock will outperform Nvidia by year end. Let's find out more.\nThe stock I predict will beat Nvidia by year end is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Its booming e-commerce business sells essentials, general merchandise, and even various devices, books, and movies. It has become a household name, especially thanks to its Prime subscription service, with more than 200 million members.\nThis helped Amazon report more than $121 billion in North American and international revenue in the most recent quarter, gaining in both of these areas year over year.\nAnd the company might see more sign-ups for Prime in the coming weeks as it plans another Prime Big Deal Days sales event in October. With bargains exclusively for Prime members, these events are known to boost membership in the service.\nEven better, Amazon usually does well when it comes to retaining members. After a 30-day trial period last year, 72% of users subscribed to the service, according to Statista.\nRegardless of the economy, customers see value in a Prime membership because they can buy essentials for good prices and get fast and free delivery.\nOn top of this sure and steady revenue source, investors also benefit from growth thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business, and this is where we'll find the company's AI strengths. AWS offers a broad range of cloud services, and it has gone all in on AI, selling its own lower-priced chips, premium Nvidia chips, a full-service AI platform known as Amazon Bedrock, and much more.\nManagement says it aims to be involved in every layer of AI -- from chips to power programs to apps.\nAll of this has helped AWS reach an annual revenue run rate of $105 billion this year, particularly important because AWS has traditionally been Amazon's profit driver. In the most recent quarter, AWS operating income made up 63% of the company's total.\nIn recent times, Nvidia's growth has topped that of Amazon and other tech companies and has wowed investors. But as sentiment becomes more cautious, investors might turn to companies such as Amazon that are involved in AI but are less dependent on it than Nvidia. Right now, both of these players are trading around the same level, at 37 times forward earnings estimates, and Amazon might seem like a safer bet for the price.\nThis doesn't mean Nvidia and the AI market won't deliver on their promises over the coming years; I'm confident that any short-term uncertainty in the market won't change this exciting long-term story.\nBut my prediction is that Nvidia, after recently losing momentum, might leave room for others to jump ahead on share price performance in the coming months. And Amazon is likely to take the lead.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 13, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD.\nNVIDIA Corporation\u2019s meteoric rise in the last few years due to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) came to a screeching halt last week after the company was plagued with antitrust issues.\nHowever, the possibility of a new U.S.-Saudi Arabia deal related to NVIDIA\u2019s chips and encouraging comments on Blackwell chip production by CEO Jensen Huang lifted the semiconductor giant\u2019s stock on Wednesday\u2019s trading session by 8.2%.\nBut can NVIDIA\u2019s share price scale upward for the rest of the year and beyond? Let\u2019s have a look \u2013\nOn Wednesday, Semafor, citing credible sources, stated that the U.S. government is considering allowing NVIDIA to export its advanced chips to Saudi Arabia, which would help the Middle Eastern nation run sophisticated AI models. At Saudi Arabia\u2019s global AI summit, attendees discussed accessing NVIDIA\u2019s H200 chips, initially used in OpenAI's GPT-4o, a multimodal transformer.\nIf the restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors are lifted, NVIDIA\u2019s revenues will surge due to the heightened demand in Saudi Arabia. NVIDIA is making the most of the rise in global semiconductor sales, which hit $51.3 billion in July, up 18.7% year over year, per the Semiconductor Industry Association.\nAt a technology conference hosted by Goldman Sachs on Wednesday, Huang said that NVIDIA has ramped up manufacturing of the much-awaited next-generation Blackwell chips. Shipping of these high-end chips will begin in significant numbers in the fourth quarter to cater to high demand.\nMicrosoft Corp., and others have ordered the Blackwell chips in large numbers worth billions of dollars, while Amazon.com, Inc. is contemplating moving from Hopper to Blackwell as it has more AI throughput.\nThe new Blackwell\u2019s NVLink will offer high-speed communication, while its graphic processing unit (GPU) will have more power. The NVIDIA CEO also confirmed they will move to other fabrications if required and reduce dependency on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited to develop the chip designs.\nHuang recently said that a huge chunk of data would be transferred from the central processing units to GPUs, a blessing for NVIDIA since the chip giant has more than 80% share in the GPU market, which is estimated to reach $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion in 2024, at a CAGR of 13.8%, according to Precedence Research.\nNVIDIA\u2019s dominance in the GPU market propelled the company\u2019s revenues from the data center GPU business to $26.2 billion in the second quarter, up 154% year over year. In comparison, NVIDIA\u2019s arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u2019s revenues from the data center business grew 115% to only $2.8 billion.\nNVIDIA\u2019s GPUs enjoy a wide competitive moat because of the dependency that developers have on the CUDA software platform. Unlike CUDA, AMD\u2019s software platform, ROCm isn\u2019t considered to be very efficient.\nNVIDIA is also benefiting from the growing interest in AI, as GPUs are an integral part of the computer server infrastructure needed to train large language models and operate AI interfaces. NVIDIA\u2019s H100 graphic cards are the most sought-after in the AI chip market. The AI industry is projected to grow from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion in 2030, according to Markets and Markets.\nThe likely ease in restrictions on the sale of chips to Saudi Arabia, Blackwell production heating up, and the clear lead in the GPU space would boost NVIDIA\u2019s shares in the near future.\nNotable brokers, hence, have jacked up the average short-term price target of NVDA by 38.1% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $108.10. The highest price target set by the analysts is $200, signifying an upside of 85%.\nAdditionally, so far this year, NVIDIA\u2019s shares have traded above the 200-day moving average, which is indicative of a prolonged uptrend.\nNVIDIA stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Text": "\nNvidia shares slipped Monday, giving up some of last week's gains as the stock's bout of volatility continued.\nThe stock hit a record high in mid-June but has since been on a rollercoaster ride as investors have tempered their AI optimism and embraced rate-sensitive stocks.\nMany analysts, noting the company's dominance in the red-hot AI arms race, remain bullish on the stock despite its recent loss of momentum.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) stock dipped on Monday, giving back some of last week\u2019s gains as the semiconductor giant\u2019s stretch of volatility continued.\nShares of Nvidia finished down about 2% Monday, retreating after surging nearly 16% last week amid encouraging comments from CEO Jensen Huang and analysts. Tech stocks trailed the broader market on Monday, led by Micron (MU), which slid more than 4% after Bank of America issued a warning about the memory-chip market, and Broadcom (AVGO), down 2%.\nNvidia's stock has been plagued by turbulence for months as Wall Street's once boundless optimism about artificial intelligence has moderated. Its shares, pressured throughout July and early August by a shift in interest rate expectations, rebounded throughout August before tumbling again at the end of the month after the company's second-quarter earnings report disappointed investors despite exceeding expectations on paper.\nAmid that slump, the stock recorded the largest ever single-day loss of market value in history earlier this month when its shares tumbled nearly 10% amid a semiconductor sell-off. A recent rebound has been characterized by below-average volume, possibly a sign of limited participation from institutional investors in last week's dip-buying.\nSince the chipmaker's earnings, however, analysts have reiterated their bullish stance on the stock. Bank of America argued the post-earning slump presented an \u201cenhanced buying opportunity\u201d while Bernstein analysts recently called Nvidia the \u201cbest way to play AI.\u201d\nWedbush analysts in a note on Monday argued the Fed\u2019s imminent pivot to rate cuts, which are widely expected to begin on Wednesday, should support tech sector stocks in the coming months.\n\u201cWe believe the stage is set for tech stocks to move higher into year-end and 2025 in our opinion as the Fed and Powell kick off its rate cutting cycle this week, macro soft landing remains the path, and tech spending on AI remains a generational spending cycle just starting to hit the shores of the tech sector,\u201d the analysts wrote.\nNvidia, they argue, is effectively the \u201conly game in town\u201d as far as AI chips are concerned, putting it in a prime position to capture much of the $1 trillion they estimate will be spent on AI infrastructure in the next few years.\nRead the original article on Investopedia.\n"

        "Title": "CEO Jensen Huang Keeps Dumping Nvidia Stock. Should You Be Worried?",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the stock sensation of the artificial intelligence (AI) era, with shares up 700% since the start of 2023. However, there recently has been one potential warning sign that financial media outlets and investors have keyed in on: CEO Jensen Huang is rapidly trimming his stake in the AI leader.\nNearly every day for the past few months, Huang has sold Nvidia stock. For example, on Sept. 12 and 13, he sold about 200,000 shares, worth more than $20 million.\nAccording to Nvidia filings, Huang's stock sales are based on a predetermined plan known as a 10b5-1 that he entered into on March 14, 2024. The 10b5-1 structure exists so insiders like Huang can sell their company stock without any suspicions of insider trading. Because the transactions are pre-determined and authorized by Huang's brokerage, they're unrelated to the price of the stock, any news, or material non-public information.\nInvestors don't know the exact plan around Huang's 10b5-1, but it's clear it involves frequent Nvidia stock sales from the CEO's holdings.\nEven though the stock selling was pre-planned, it still shows that Huang is trimming his stake in Nvidia. Notably, Huang also entered into the plan in March when Nvidia stock was at a significantly lower price than it is now.\nHowever, CEO stock sales don't necessarily indicate bearishness on the stock or even that it's time for profit-taking. Individual investors should remember that Huang is now one of the richest people in the world, with a company that's worth nearly $3 trillion. As of March 25, 2024, he owned 934,637,910 split-adjusted shares of Nvidia, which would be worth more than $100 billion at the stock's current price.\nIn that light, selling even $10 million worth of Nvidia stock a day doesn't seem drastic. Even if Huang sold that much every trading day for a year, it would only put a small dent in his holdings, reducing them by roughly $2.6 billion.\nConsidering that, it seems harder to see the sales as a significant bearish signal about the stock, as they only amount to a small percentage of his stake. Additionally, they're not enough to have an impact on Nvidia's trading volume, as the business is worth nearly $3 trillion, and more than 340 million shares, or roughly $40 billion worth, change hands on an average day.\nRather than fixate on Jensen Huang's recent stock sales, investors are better off heeding his recent comments on the company, which show that demand for its products is still soaring.\nAt the Goldman Sachs Communacopia conference last week, Huang was asked what he was worried about and said that Nvidia chips are in such high demand that it's \"really emotional for people because it directly affects their revenues, it directly affects their competitiveness.\" In other words, demand is still significantly exceeding supply, and the company is working hard to rectify that.\nNvidia expects to see revenue grow again in the third quarter, forecasting sequential revenue growth of 8%, though it typically beats its own estimates. Additionally, Nvidia's customers continue to tout their eagerness to invest in more AI infrastructure -- spending money on Nvidia components.\nIf Huang was dumping all of his Nvidia stock, it would be deserving of scrutiny. However, in the current environment, selling a small percentage of his holdings seems meaningless.\nThat doesn't mean that Nvidia stock will keep going up. The stock is likely to remain volatile, but Huang's stock sales aren't the sell signal that some investors might think they are.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Step Aside, Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It in Favor of 2 Other High-Growth Stock-Split Stocks",
        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been all the rage on Wall Street since 2023 began, excitement surrounding stock splits has given AI a run for its money this year.\nA stock split gives publicly traded companies the ability to superficially alter their share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. Splits are surface-scratching in the sense that they don't change a company's market cap or in any way affect underlying operating performance.\nAlthough there are two types of stock splits -- forward and reverse -- investors usually gravitate to companies conducting forward splits. This type of split is designed to lower a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for investors who are unable to purchase fractional shares through their broker. Companies enacting forward splits are usually outpacing their competition from an execution and innovation standpoint.\nSince 2024 began, a little over a dozen leading businesses have announced or completed a stock split -- all but one of which was of the forward-split variety.\nHowever, the outlook for some of these premier stock-split stocks is mixed among Wall Street's brightest and richest investors. Based on the latest round of form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, billionaires were decisive sellers of cutting-edge AI stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the second quarter, but were avid buyers of two other high-growth stock-split stocks.\nFor three consecutive quarters, dating back to the start of October 2023, no fewer than seven billionaire money managers have reduced their respective stakes in Nvidia. The June-ended quarter featured seven billionaire sellers, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\nKen Griffin of Citadel (9,282,018 shares)\nDavid Tepper of Appaloosa Management (3,730,000 shares)\nStanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (1,545,370 shares)\nCliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,360,215 shares)\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (676,242 shares)\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (409,042 shares)\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (96,963 shares)\nWith Nvidia completing its largest-ever forward split (10 for 1) in June, these billionaires might have chosen to ring the register and diversify their respective portfolios. But there looks to be more to this story than simple profit taking.\nAlthough Nvidia has undeniably benefited from its first-mover advantages as the standout supplier of AI graphics processing units (GPUs), competition is now coming at it from all angles.\nWith the debut of Nvidia's Blackwell chip delayed by at least three months due to reported design flaws and supply chain issues, and the company's prized H100 GPU backlogged, it should be relatively easy for external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices to find strong demand for their AI GPUs.\nMoreover, Nvidia's top customers are signaling an eventual reduced reliance on the AI kingpin. Its four largest clients by net sales are all developing AI GPUs that they plan to use in their data centers. Even with Nvidia's chips maintaining their computing advantage, the writing is on the wall that these customers intend to use their cheaper internally developed hardware.\nBillionaires might also be spooked by the persistent insider selling at Nvidia. While not all insider selling is necessarily nefarious (e.g., insiders sometimes sell stock to pay their tax bill), it is noteworthy that not one executive or board member has purchased shares on the open market since December 2020.\nLastly, billionaire asset managers might be concerned about what history tells us. Since the advent of the internet roughly three decades ago, every next-big-thing trend has worked its way through an early-stage bubble. It's unlikely that AI is going to be the exception.\nBut while billionaires were showing Nvidia to the door, they were busy scooping up shares of two other high-growth stock-split stocks.\nThe first stock-split stock that struck the fancy of six billionaire money managers during the second quarter is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), a specialist in customizable rack server and storage solutions. These billionaire buyers were:\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (553,323 shares)\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International Group (508,814 shares)\nKen Griffin of Citadel (98,752 shares)\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (45,066 shares)\nRay Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (15,777 shares)\nCliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,040 shares)\nWith the stock catapulting to north of $1,200 during the first quarter, it's not in the least bit surprising to see Supermicro's board approving a 10-for-1 forward split, to take effect after trading ends on Sept. 30.\nHowever, the prospect of a stock split isn't the primary draw for billionaires to Supermicro. The lure is the seemingly insatiable demand from businesses wanting to be among the first to capitalize on the AI revolution by training large language models and running generative Ai solutions. To do so, they'll need the necessary infrastructure in place, which Supermicro can provide.\nThe company's operating results have also given billionaires reason to be excited. Net sales jumped 110% to $14.9 billion in fiscal 2024 (the company's fiscal year ends on June 30), and the midpoint of its guidance calls for $28 billion in net revenue for the current year. This forecast screams that demand is exceptional at the moment.\nBut it won't be an easy ride. With its use of Nvidia's H100 GPUs in its customizable data-center rack servers, and the H100 backlogged, Supermicro finds itself at the mercy of its suppliers.\nFurthermore, the company is the target of a short-seller report from Hindenburg Research, which has alleged accounting manipulation. Despite denying these allegations, management did delay the annual filing of its operating results, which did little to soothe investor concerns.\nDespite its relatively inexpensive valuation, Super Micro Computer has a lot to prove to Wall Street and investors.\nThe other stock-split stock that billionaires very clearly favored over Nvidia in the June-ended quarter is AI networking solutions and services providers Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). Seven billionaire investors took the plunge in the second quarter, including:\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,930,970 shares)\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International Group (2,347,500 shares)\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,096,440 shares)\nKen Griffin of Citadel (1,880,740 shares)\nJohn Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (1,332,230 shares)\nKen Fisher of Fisher Investments (865,090 shares)\nKeeping with the theme of this list, Broadcom also announced a 10-for-1 forward split (the first in the company's history), which was completed in mid-July.\nBroadcom's AI ties have certainly been the fuel behind its recent uptick in growth. In particular, the company's networking solutions are responsible for connecting large numbers of AI GPUs in order to reduce tail latency and maximize the computing potential of AI-accelerating hardware. Presumably, demand for its AI networking solutions will remain robust as long as businesses keep gobbling up AI GPUs.\nHowever, billionaires might be equally excited about Broadcom having a solid foundation that extends well beyond artificial intelligence. It generates a significant amount of revenue and profits from the wireless chips and accessories it provides for next-generation smartphones. And it's a key provider of optical components used in automated industrial equipment, as well as networking solutions for next-gen vehicles.\nLastly, billionaires might be impressed with the company's track record of earnings-accretive acquisitions. For example, the $69 billion purchase of cloud-based virtualization software company VMware in November 2023 perfectly positions Broadcom to be an important player in helping businesses with their private- and hybrid-cloud needs.\nWith a more diverse revenue stream than Nvidia or Super Micro Computer, Broadcom would be best-positioned to navigate an AI bubble-bursting event, should one occur.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Best High Risk High Reward Growth Stock To Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 High Risk High Reward Growth Stocks Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other high risk high reward growth stocks.\nWhen it comes to making money on the stock market, most investors are typically attracted to growth stocks. Growth stocks are primarily identified by the price to earnings ratio (P/E) for those firms that are profitable. A higher P/E ratio compared to the industry multiple means that investors have already priced in future growth into the share price to an extent and any surpassing of investor expectations sees the share price appreciate. Since some firms, particularly those in the software as a service (SaaS) industry, reinvest their revenue into growth, their earnings are often negative. Subsequently, the growth potential of these stocks is evaluated by their EV/Sales ratio, and you can find more details by reading\u00a011 Best Cloud Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\nHowever, while these metrics are important for evaluating stocks, they often do not cover the riskiest stocks that promise the highest returns. In theory, stocks with the lowest prices often carry a higher potential of 10x or even 100x gains. This is because their low prices and small market size both have a substantially larger potential for growth when compared to bigger firms. These returns typically materialize over the course of several decades.\nFor instance, after accounting for their stock splits, the three most valuable firms in the world were trading at $0.10, $0.11, and $0.04, respectively. In today\u2019s post inflationary terms, this means that their shares started to trade at $0.19, $0.21, and $0.08 in the same order. As a result, these bottom barrel stocks at the time of their IPOs, have delivered 183,916%, 401,600%, and 256,975% in returns through price appreciation after their stock market debut.\nIn short, these\u00a01,500x+\u00a0returns through price appreciations are what drive countless investors to flock to the stock market daily. Yet, these returns also mean that investors, particularly inexperienced ones or those on the retail side, fall victim to scams. In fact, along with offering the highest potential for returns, micro cap stocks are also the ones with the greatest number of scams. For instance, one common way in which stock brokerages target unsuspecting retail investors is through a chop stock. This practice isn\u2019t illegal, but it involves the seller withholding key information from the buyer. A chop stock is a stock that a brokerage buys from a large shareholder at a deep discount and then sells to unwary buyers at market price which creates a conflict of interest for the selling party as it stands to significantly profit from any sale.\nWhile there are no surefire ways to spot a chop stock, an investor should be on the lookout for stocks that their brokerages (or others) are selling at slight or medium discounts to the market price, and in case of the brokerages, not disclosing the commission made from the sale. The mantra is simple: If it\u2019s too good to be true, it generally is. While all this sounds nefarious, it isn\u2019t the only legal way that gullible investors are exploited on the stock market.\nIn fact, one of the more common and legal ways through which investors, particularly in smaller companies, are harmed is additional share issues by firms who are struggling to raise capital through profits or debt financing. Share sales, even though they provide investors an opportunity to profit via price appreciations, are less riskier than debt issues since in case a company becomes a gone concern, debt holders are required to be paid back first. Naturally, firms prefer them for these reasons, but the more shares are issued, the lower the value of existing equity becomes. Consequently, you are likely to see micro cap stocks in particular drop in prices after management announces additional equity raises.\nAdditionally, firms that are struggling operationally try to shore up their corresponding stock devaluation through reverse stock splits. These reduce the number of shares outstanding but also end up providing unwary investors with a false sense of comfort in seeing the value of their investments increase. Since the share price appreciation is unrelated to business fundamentals, it carries the risk of depreciation in the future if the firm fails to reverse poor performance. This fact is also backed by research from the University of Texas and Lamar University. After analyzing 1,206 reverse stock splits between 1995 and 2011, the research\u00a0demonstrates\u00a0that less than half, 500 or 41%, of the firms, were able to continue operations for five years or longer after the reverse split. Out of the other 59%, a whopping 80% were de listed from exchanges less than five years after the reverse split, for reasons that include bankruptcy. The remaining 20% were acquired, and for this subset, the median survival time post split was just 20.9 months.\nThere are some tips that an investor can use to avoid stock scams. For instance, one should never fall for a sense of urgency created by the seller, believe only in verifiable and raw numbers as opposed to \u2018testimonials\u2019 that promise quick riches, ensure that anyone selling an investment is a licensed finance professional, be on the lookout for effort free ways to quickly make massive amounts of money, and follow the principle of \u2018if it\u2019s too good to be true, it generally isn\u2019t.\u2019 Other warning signs of micro cap stock fraud include stocks of shell companies with little to no operations, heavy promotion of the stock as opposed to the actual business, sudden and rapid jumps in share prices and trading volume, and trading suspensions by the SEC.\nInvestment research websites, newsletters, emails, and even newspapers can all pitch micro cap stock scams. So just because the source appears credible doesn\u2019t mean the underlying stock is as well. Finally, research is a non negotiable for any investment decision, and the\u00a0SEC has listed\u00a0several ways to conduct research. Yet, just because a firm regularly releases information doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s ripe for investment solely because of this fact.\nWith these details in mind, let\u2019s take a look at some high risk high reward growth stocks to buy.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Its high performing GPUs have allowed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to become the third most valuable company in the world in terms of market capitalization. Its GPUs are one of the hottest commodities in the world, which provides the firm with a wide moat. However, their short supply and the rush in the industry to implement AI software have also forced companies to look for alternatives to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s products. This has seen firms like OpenAI work with Broadcom to design NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU alternatives. Additionally, the firm can see stricter action by the US government for purported abuse of market power as well as an AI slowdown or a GPU glut to create further headwinds for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s shares that have lost 23% since mid June. However, the firm\u2019s key competitive advantages because of its strong product performance and established demand for its products make NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) less risky than most of the stocks on our list.\nArtisan Partners mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s year-to-date dollar value increase is $1.8 trillion. That\u2019s equivalent to the 2023 increase in US GDP, which is, of course, representative of the collective economic efforts of about 330 million people. NVIDIA\u2019s market cap is now $3 trillion. So is the GDP of France.\nOverall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of high risk and high reward stocks. But our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been on a monster run since the start of 2023, but so has peer AMD (NASDAQ: AMD). While AMD is up a respectable 140% since 2023 began, Nvidia has dwarfed its run by rising around 700%. This has led some investors to believe that AMD could be slated to outperform Nvidia moving forward, but there's a lot more to that argument.\nDespite its outperformance, I still think Nvidia is a better investment choice than AMD, as there is more to a company than stock price performance.\nBoth companies make hardware for computers of all varieties, but the extent of their product lines varies between them. Nvidia is laser-focused on making the best graphics processing units (GPUs). It has other product lines too, but those are meant to complement its GPUs.\nAMD also makes GPUs, but they aren't as advanced as Nvidia's, and they lack top-tier software allowing their users to extract the most computing power. So, when compared head-to-head in the GPU space, Nvidia's product reigns supreme.\nBut AMD has a much larger product line than just GPUs. The company has significant exposure to consumers through its client division, which makes CPUs for PCs. It also makes products for various gaming consoles and has an embedded processor line that allows clients to specify chips that are highly customized to their application. In addition to its data center GPUs that compete with Nvidia, it also has a wide variety of other components that go into these cutting-edge servers.\nBecause AMD is much broader than Nvidia, it can't cash in on one massive trend. This is one reason why AMD has underperformed Nvidia, as AMD's results have been a mixed bag by division.\nAMD Segment\nQ2 Revenue Total\nYOY Growth\nData Center\n$2.83 billion\n115%\nClient\n$1.49 billion\n49%\nGaming\n$648 million\n(59%)\nEmbedded\n$861 million\n(41%)\nData source: AMD. Note: YOY = Year over year.\nFortunately, AMD's biggest segments are the ones that are growing the fastest, but the other struggling divisions are still acting as an anchor to the overall business.\nNvidia has a similar setup to AMD, with different divisions. However, its data center segment is so large that it makes the others practically insignificant when assessing the business.\nNvidia Segment\nQ2 Revenue Total\nYOY Growth\nData Center\n$26.3 billion\n154%\nGaming and AI PC\n$2.9 billion\n9%\nProfessional Visualization\n$454 million\n20%\nAutomotive and Robotics\n$346 million\n37%\nData source: Nvidia. Note: YOY = Year over year. Note: Nvidia's Q2 ended July 28.\nWith the data center division doing so well and being much larger than any other division, Nvidia has become a great way to invest directly in the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure build-out trend, which is slated to continue for a long time.\nThis is why Nvidia looks like a much better pick right now. But if AMD could be bought at the right price, it may not be a bad investment, either.\nNormally, when two companies compete with each other, the winner holds a premium valuation to the company in second place. However, that's not the case with AMD and Nvidia.\nFrom a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, AMD is more expensive than Nvidia despite Nvidia's higher performance. This doesn't make a lot of sense, so if you're trying to decide between the two, it's likely better to buy the stock that is performing at a higher level and is cheaper than the other.\nNvidia remains a no-brainer choice over AMD as an investment right now. Its exposure to one of the biggest industry trends since the internet exploded is massive. If investors want direct exposure to the trend, then buying Nvidia stock instead of AMD is smart.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "2 Reasons to Sell Nvidia Stock (and 1 Reason to Buy)",
        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "With shares down roughly 15% since the company's second-quarter earnings report on Aug. 8, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) legendary bull run might be in trouble. While operational results remain as strong as ever, investors may be growing concerned about the sustainability of Nvidia's business model and the artificial intelligence (AI) industry as a whole. Let's discuss two reasons to consider selling the stock and one reason to buy the dip.\nGross profit margin compares a company's revenue to the direct production costs of selling its goods or services before overhead expenses like office salaries, advertising, or research. Typically, this metric favors software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies that don't sell physical products. But with a gross margin of 75%, Nvidia bucks the trend.\nFor context, Microsoft, the biggest SaaS company in the world, has a gross margin of just under 70%, while Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, stands at 57%. Nvidia is now selling physical hardware at a greater markup than others can sell digital services. And this dynamic doesn't look natural or sustainable over the long term. \nGenerally, free markets tend to compete away excess profitability. And if that doesn't work, governments tend to get involved. \nThis month, Bloomberg News reported that the Department of Justice subpoenaed Nvidia in an \"escalating antitrust probe\" related to its dominant position in the market for AI processors. The report claims that officials suspect the company may be making it harder for clients to use other suppliers and penalizing them if they do.\nNvidia denies the report and claims that its high market share (estimated at 88%) stems from its product's better speed and quality. Either way, Nvidia's business practices (legal or not) may be starting to attract the wrong sort of attention. And investors should take notice.\nFor better or worse, Nvidia has managed to keep competition at bay within the market for AI-capable hardware. That said, the company can't control the consumer-facing software side of the industry, where cracks are beginning to show in the long-term thesis.\nAccording to The New York Times, the AI boom may be ending, with several high-profile start-ups such as Inflection AI, Stability AI, and Anthropic generating massive losses and/or downsizing their operations. Cloud computing giants like Google or Amazon's AWS fare better by targeting the infrastructure side of the opportunity (renting out computing power). But if the start-ups fail, data center demand could also nosedive.\nSome of Nvidia's top customers, such as Meta Platforms, don't even expect to make money from their AI investment anytime soon.\nMeta, which is known for its open-source large language model Llama, is simply trying to stay at the leading edge of the technology. But while this sounds great in theory, it is reminiscent of its failed pivot to the metaverse in 2021 -- a money-burning experiment that was eventually shelved amid shareholder backlash.\nShareholders might tolerate companies spending billions on experimental technologies when the economy is buoyant. However, if macroeconomic conditions tighten, managerial teams will be pressured to fall back. \nDespite all these challenges, Nvidia is not a bad company. The chipmaker produces cutting-edge hardware that could quickly find new use cases, even if generative AI demand fades. The most promising opportunity could be self-driving cars, which analysts at McKinsey think could be worth up to $400 billion in revenue by 2035.\nRobotics, augmented reality, and even the metaverse could also support demand for Nvidia's hardware for decades to come.\nAt the end of the day, long-term investing is the key to sustainable returns in the stock market because it smooths out the market's volatility and noise -- allowing time for a company's thesis to play out. Nvidia bulls might be willing to overlook some of the chipmaker's near-term challenges in favor of the bigger picture.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has not sent Nvidia a formal subpoena as part of its AI antitrust probe, Nvidia said late on Wednesday according to Bloomberg. This means that the DOJ has not officially made any complaints against Nvidia, and the company is formally not under an investigation.\nEarlier on Wednesday Bloomberg reported that the U.S. DOJ had issued legally binding subpoenas to Nvidia and third-party companies like AMD and Intel as part of its AI antitrust probe that is focused around Nvidia's dominance in the AI sector. While Nvidia confirmed communication with the DOJ, it clarified that it has not been issued a formal subpoena but has received a request for information, or a civil investigative demand (CID).\nWhile subpoenas and CIDs are used by investigators, these are different types of tools. A subpoena is a formal legal document that orders an individual or entity to either provide documents, appear in court, or testify before a legal authority and are usually issued during an active legal case. Subpoenas require compliance under threat of legal penalty. A CID enables agencies like the DOJ to request answers to written questions, give oral testimony, or documents, but CIDs are used to gather information for evaluating whether to pursue legal action. Therefore, they do not indicate a formal legal case is underway.\nAntitrust officials are probing whether Nvidia behaves anticompetitively on the AI market by pressuring buyers to use its AI processors exclusively, disadvantaging its competitors, restricting customer options, and making it harder to switch from its processors to competing platforms. Nvidia denies all allegations.\nOfficials are examining accusations that Nvidia delays orders for customers who do not solely use its AI GPUs, effectively making it harder for them to switch to rival processors like those from AMD and Intel. Additionally, Nvidia is accused of forcing cloud providers to purchase its GPUs bundled with its own networking equipment, reducing their purchasing flexibility. Another concern is whether Nvidia charges higher prices for networking products to customers who opt for competing AI chips.\nThe investigation also looks at Nvidia\u2019s acquisition of RunAI, a company specializing in AI workload management software, with regulators worried that this deal could further cement Nvidia's market dominance and limit customers' ability to choose alternative solutions as once Nvidia's RunAI software is deployed, a datacenter cannot really use non-Nvidia GPUs.\n"

        "Text": "What happens when a company's largest customers become fierce competitors? Imagine that you own the largest chocolate chip company in the land. You sell to all the largest grocery chains because you have the best recipe. But every day, those stores pour money into finding the next-best recipe. If they create it, it could be a recipe for disaster (pardon the pun).\nThis is Nvidia's reality now. Companies like Microsoft, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms, and Amazon are spending billions on Nvidia GPUs while also spending billions developing competing products. The key for Nvidia is to stay one step ahead. But it won't be easy with such deep-pocketed competitors.\nAs shown below, the four massive tech companies mentioned above reportedly account for nearly 40% of Nvidia's revenue, which exploded to $96 billion over the past 12 months.\nOf this, 85% comes from Nvidia's data center division. Whatever company can encroach on Nvidia's massive market share of reportedly 70% to 95% in artificial intelligence (AI) chips will benefit in two ways: increased income and reduced expenses. After all, much of that giant ramp in Nvidia's revenue, depicted above, comes from other big tech companies' pockets.\nNvidia is leading due to its groundbreaking H100 GPU, which delivers unparalleled performance. These units are critical for data centers, large language models, and generative AI, so Nvidia can't keep up with demand and the margins are gigantic.\nAlphabet is developing and improving its competing AI product, the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). It launched the sixth-generation TPU, Trillium, earlier this year. With five times more speed and 67% more energy efficiency, sixth-gen Trillium is a considerable leap over version five.\nTrillium doesn't compete directly on the open market with Nvidia. Instead, customers rent space on Google Cloud, allowing Alphabet a broader customer base. The ability to rent space will be intense competition for Nvidia as companies can choose to rent rather than make capital investments. And, of course, Alphabet uses it internally.\nAlphabet can pour capital into AI projects because it is hugely profitable and generates massive cash flow from its core advertising (Google Search and YouTube) and Google Cloud segments. These segments generated $84 billion in sales last quarter, a 14% year-over-year increase that came with $27 billion in operating cash flow.\nAlso impressive is that the operating margin for Google Cloud increased from 5% to 11% year over year. The increase in margin is a clear indication of increased efficiency and growing demand. As you can see below, Google Cloud's growth has been remarkable in recent years.\nEven after growing nearly fourfold since 2020, AI will increase Google Cloud's sales. For Alphabet, investments in AI, Google Cloud, and generative chatbots that rival ChatGPT, like Gemini, are crucial to the long-term path.\nMicrosoft Bing is challenging Google Search by harnessing ChatGPT through its billion-dollar investment in its creator, OpenAI. Plus, generative AI may encroach on the search market. However, there is no need to sound an alarm yet; Google Search grew 14% last quarter to $49 billion in revenue and remains far and away the market leader.\nAlphabet stock looks like a bargain in a market where many tech stocks are trading well above historical valuations. As shown below, Microsoft trades 14% above its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, while Alphabet trades 12% below.\nThe historical undervaluation, quality core business, and potential to compete for part of Nvidia's market dominance make Alphabet stock an intelligent buy for tech investors and those looking for GARP (growth at a reasonable price) companies.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks To Buy According To Short Sellers.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other autonomous driving stocks.\nREAD ALSO 13 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers and 8 Best EV Stocks According to Short Seller Sentiment\n2024 is the year of artificial intelligence. The revolutionary new technology that has disrupted the status quo on Wall Street has managed to shift investor attention away from economic turmoil to a specific set of firms that can benefit from the massive expected enterprise spending on accelerated computing and the associated industries needed to enable this shift. This has meant that despite the fact that interest rates have been at a 23 year high, the flagship S&P index is up by almost 44% since the close of 2022 while the tech heavy broader NASDAQ index has gained 63% during the same time period.\nOne technology that is part of artificial intelligence is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving, in its simplest form, is built on machine learning. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence, so, autonomous driving is also artificial intelligence - a fact that is often left underappreciated by the broader media and analyst coverage. Autonomous driving uses neural nets to assimilate existing data and predict the behavior of pedestrians and other drivers. This ability offers the potential to create new industries, particularly where car owners provide their vehicles for autonomous ride sharing to earn money when they don't need their vehicles.\nAccording to McKinsey, consumer willingness to rely on shared autonomous vehicles for their trips over trips taken on existing private vehicles has only grown. As an example, its 2022 research showed that 56% of consumers surveyed were willing to use shared autonomous vehicles provided that they did not increase travel time and were at least 20% cheaper compared to their private counterparts. Additionally, 34% of those surveyed wanted level 4 (L4) autonomy in their next vehicle purchase. Autonomous driving is categorized across five levels, with level 1 being simple features such as cruise control and level 5 being a fully autonomous system that does not require any human attention or interaction.\nMcKinsey estimates that revenue from autonomous ride sharing fleet vehicles such as robotaxis and robo-shuttles could touch $400 billion by 2030, based on statistics such as the German passenger car fleet of 50 million vehicles being parked 95% of the time and offering 250 million seats to meet the entire population's mobility needs.\nBuilding on this, while we'll get to the strides made by Elon Musk's car company on this front later, other car companies have also jumped into the fray. For instance, the second best automotive stock to buy according to hedge funds has teamed up with Goldman Sachs' eighth best hedge fund stock pick through its Cruise business to offer autonomous ride sharing services to customers next year. This will be one of the first robotaxi projects of its kind, and its announcement came months after the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association (AVIA) had shared its first ever State of AV report. It shared that autonomous vehicles have driven nearly 70 million miles on American roads, with most of these being recent as the number of miles driven had marked a 59% growth since July 2023.\nWhile big ticket car brands typically dominate the autonomous driving conversation, there are several private and small companies that are also 'driving' the mileage for autonomous vehicles so to speak. One such firm is Nuro, which aims to develop L4 logistics vehicles capable of making deliveries. It tests its products in a closed track in Las Vegas, and the firm has driven one million autonomous miles to date. Another firm is Gatik, which has partnered up with the second best hedge fund eCommerce stock pick and also the biggest brick and mortar retailer in the world. It offers autonomous transportation as a service (ATaaS) by operating box trucks that autonomously ship goods within different supply chain nodes such as fulfillment and distribution centers, stores, and warehouses.\nComing back to Elon Musk's car company, autonomous driving and robotaxis are at the center of its valuation, at least as far as RBC Capital and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest are concerned. According to RBC, Robotaxi's revenue can sit at $120 billion in 2040, with the autonomous ride sharing business accounting for 52% of the firm's valuation. Ark, as expected, is more optimistic. Its expected value for the car company's share price is $2,600 in 2029, which will be driven by $8.2 trillion in enterprise value, $1.2 trillion in revenue, and $440 billion in operating income. As per the hedge fund's research, 88%, 63%, and 86% of these values will be driven by Robotaxi.\nSince autonomous vehicles require GPUs to train neural networks, and big tech firms' insatiable PGU demand for non-autonomy related AI use cases has made these chips one of the hottest commodities in the world, a shortage in GPUs could impact the projected growth in autonomy. For instance, emails obtained by CNBC in June revealed that Musk had asked his GPU supplier to divert supplies intended for his car company to the social media firm X and AI company xAI. These shipments were worth roughly $500 million, and the latest earnings saw him share that he had no choice but to compete with the world's largest GPU maker.\nDuring the call, Musk outlined that since it was hard to procure the \"state-of-the-art\" GPUs, \" when we want them. And I think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on Dojo in order to have \u2014 in order to ensure that we\u2019ve got the training capability that we need. So we are going to double down on Dojo, and we do see a path to being competitive with \" the GPU company.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the best autonomous driving stocks, we ranked the holdings of Global X's autonomy ETF that are focused on autonomous driving by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short and selected the stocks with the lowest percentage.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nShort Interest as % of\u00a0 Shares Outstanding: 1.20%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the global leader in designing artificial intelligence chips. Its GPUs are used to train neural nets and other software that forms the bedrock of autonomous driving. Additionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also serves the needs of the auto industry through its DRIVE AGX platform that allows autonomous vehicles to process data from cameras, radars, and other sensors. Its brand name which stems from high performance products has allowed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to establish a robust brand name that has enabled it to land deals with big ticket car companies like BMW and Hyundai. The firm's criticality to the AI supply means that it stands to benefit from the growth in neural network training as well as from car companies that might be looking to develop in house autonomy solutions but skip the costs of developing in vehicle computing hardware. However, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is often vulnerable to high cyclical variation and inventory glut due to hot demand for its products and could face headwinds in the future if trade tensions between the US and China intensify.\nBaron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cMore recently, however, we\u2019ve entered the period of doubts and questioning, some of which is real and normal in the first stages of a new paradigm, and some of which is prompted by short sellers. Given the explosive returns of NVIDIA and other AI leaders, AI bears and fear mongers have been comparing the current AI market winners with the internet bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, and NVIDIA\u2019s stock move today with Cisco\u2019s back then. First, while many stocks were trading at nosebleed valuations and on made up metrics (such as price per eyeballs) before the bursting of the internet bubble, as we\u2019ve said many times, the internet proved to transform our world and create the digital age we are now living in. Second, while NVIDIA\u2019s stock price inflection has been nothing short of unprecedented for a company of its size, it was fueled almost entirely by explosive growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows\u2013 not multiple expansion. Over the last 12 months, NVIDIA\u2019s stock has eectively tripled, but its forward P/E multiple has remained essentially flat, because NVIDIA blew away Wall Street expectations despite being covered by over 60 sell-side analysts, who have increased their forward projections every single quarter. In my career, the only comparative analogue is when Apple first introduced the iPhone and stunned Wall Street with its growth. In contrast, most of Cisco\u2019s move in the late 1990s was due to multiple expansion. At its peak, Cisco traded at a P/E ratio over 130 times, more than quadruple its five-year average of 37 times. At the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA traded at a P/E ratio of 40 times, equal to its five-year average, and at a P/E to growth (or PEG) ratio for 2025 of 0.8 times, as consensus expectations are for NVIDIA to grow earnings per share 40% next year.\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other fast money stocks.\nAs the financial world grapples with shifting economic indicators and political uncertainty, insights from leading experts offer a crucial perspective on what lies ahead. With inflation showing signs of easing and the Federal Reserve signaling a likely rate cut, the focus now shifts to earnings performance and broader economic trends. Adding to this complexity are political developments, such as the possibility of a Republican sweep.\nThe latest June 2024 inflation report revealed a softer-than-expected outcome, causing varied reactions across major stock indices. Initially, futures surged in response, but have since fluctuated. Currently, the Dow is showing gains, the S&P is up slightly, and the NASDAQ is just below the flatline. Inflation dropped by a tenth of a percent month-over-month, contrary to economists' forecasts of a rise.\nChris Harvey, Head of Equity Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, and Mike Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JPMorgan, shared their perspectives on the current financial situation in an episode of CNBC's Fast Money. Chris Harvey is cautious about the concept of market rotation due to ongoing uncertainties about earnings. While he doesn't oppose rotation, he pointed out that investor confidence is still shaky.\n\"That\u2019s right. We\u2019re not against rotation; we\u2019re just waiting for more clarity. Many investors are uncertain about earnings. Until we see a situation where companies don\u2019t go down on bad news, we won\u2019t be fully convinced about the rotation. We want people to believe that numbers will improve and that things will get better. However, right now, bad news is bad news, and that suggests the rotation may not be sustainable.\"\nIn contrast, Mike Feroli discussed the anticipated rate cuts. He believes that the Fed is likely to lower rates soon due to its more aggressive stance. Feroli suggests that the economy is weaker than some might think, which supports the expectation of rate cuts. He noted that we have probably reached the peak for interest rates and that future attention will shift to earnings performance.\nFeroli also explained why he updated his forecast to September. This change is based on recent CPI data showing significant inflation drops over the past year and a rise in unemployment. He expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, with additional cuts likely on a quarterly basis.\n\"Yes, the rate cuts are coming. The Fed has signaled their intention to cut rates more aggressively than they have in the past. We also believe the economy isn\u2019t as strong as some might think, so we expect rates to come down. I think we\u2019ve already hit the peak for rates. Right now, it\u2019s really about earnings.\"\nHowever, if the labor market weakens further, the pace of these cuts could accelerate. Regarding the potential impact of a Donald Trump presidency and a possible Republican sweep, Feroli highlighted the uncertainties. A Republican sweep could lead to more tax cuts, possibly extending or expanding those from 2017, which might boost growth but also increase deficits.\nAdditionally, trade and immigration policies remain unpredictable. While deregulation might mitigate some negative effects, the overall policy environment is still uncertain. Finally, when asked about the implications of a Republican sweep for bond markets, Feroli expressed concern about the deficit trajectory. Extending all tax cuts, particularly in a more Republican-leaning scenario, could exacerbate the deficit problem.\nIn another episode of Fast Money, Chris Mman, Chief Investment Officer at Lafayette College, discussed the potential timing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, emphasizing that September appears to be a strong possibility. He notes, however, that the Fed will be influenced by upcoming economic reports. Mman also highlights concerns over equity valuations and the potential impact of delayed rate cuts on the labor market.\n\"I believe July should have been on the table based on today\u2019s report. However, the Fed usually prefers to signal their plans in advance. My expectation was that they probably wouldn't preemptively set up for September, but given today\u2019s report, it seems quite likely they will. The Fed might use upcoming meetings and communications to guide the market's expectations.\"\nAs political uncertainties, including the Democratic ticket's spotlight, add to the mix, Mman reassures that the Fed is likely to focus on economic data rather than political pressures. He stresses that while inflation remains a critical issue, the Fed's priority will be managing employment trends to avoid a deeper economic downturn.\n\"Even if inflation accelerates temporarily, it\u2019s unlikely to concern the Fed greatly. Currently, the focus has shifted more to employment reports rather than inflation. If employment were to unexpectedly strengthen, it could reduce the Fed\u2019s incentive to cut rates. Ultimately, the goal is to avoid a severe economic slowdown that would force them into aggressive rate cuts.\"\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we review recent episodes of CNBC's Fast Money, where Fast Money traders highlighted stocks with high growth potential. We tracked each stock mentioned and ranked them based on frequency. From this, we identified the top 7 stocks that were mentioned a lot by Fast Money traders and were widely held by hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s strong presence in AI is a major growth factor, as its GPUs play a crucial role in training AI models. With AI rapidly expanding across various industries, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands to gain from the increased need for its products.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s AI platforms, like NVIDIA AI Enterprise and Omniverse, further establish its leadership in this field. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s move into the automotive sector with its NVIDIA DRIVE platform for autonomous vehicles offers another promising growth opportunity. By collaborating with top automotive manufacturers and investing in autonomous driving technology, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to thrive in this emerging market.\nFinancially, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has demonstrated impressive revenue and profit growth, driven by its strengths in GPUs and AI, and its expansion into automotive and data centers. FQ2 2025 Revenue reached $30 billion, marking a 15% increase from the previous quarter and a 122% increase from the previous year, surpassing the expected $28 billion. Data center revenue hit a record $26.3 billion, up 16% from the previous quarter and 154% from the previous year, driven by high demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms.\nHere's what the CFO of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Colette Kress, has to say in their latest FQ2 2025 earnings call:\n\"Q2 was another record quarter. Revenue of $30 billion was up 15% sequentially and up 122% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $28 billion. Starting with data center, data center revenue of $26.3 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and up 154% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and our networking platforms. Compute revenue grew more than 2.5 times, networking revenue grew more than 2 times from the last year. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45% for our data center revenue and more than 50% stemmed from the consumer, Internet, and enterprise companies. Customers continue to accelerate their Hopper architecture purchases, while gearing up to adopt Blackwell.\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best fast money stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other buzzing stocks.\nSeptember and October tend to be the most volatile months for the stock market, particularly during election years. This was recently discussed by Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, who expects the volatility to stay until the end of October.\nStovall says that while the S&P 500 recovered all its 2022 bear market losses by January this year, and reached 22 new all-time highs by March, equities have digested some of these gains and experienced sector rotation away from 2023 high flyers into more defensive areas of the market. Hence, the year started great, but the markets are declining once again. The S&P 500\u2019s average volatility in October 2023 was 35% higher than the average for the remaining 11 months of the year.\nInvestors are concerned that the Fed will be slower to lower interest rates while inflation remains sticky and GDP growth begins to cool. Stovall expects three 25-basis point cuts this year, followed by another four in 2025. He thinks that while a 50 basis point cut is rare since it only ever happened twice, in 2001 and then 2007, it is still not unlikely given that the economy is worse than expected.\nAccording to Stovall, investors need to be prepared for this increased volatility as the market digests the Fed\u2019s actions and the potential impact on the economy. The market will likely remain uncertain until the Fed can find the right balance between slowing down the economy and stopping inflation, without causing a recession.\nTom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, is of a similar idea, suggesting that investors should remain cautious over the next 8 weeks, due to both uncertainty surrounding elections and the September cuts. He says that the stock market may experience a 7-10% pullback, considering there have already been two 7% corrections this year.\nLee thinks at least a 5% pullback can be anticipated, but if it\u2019s only 1-2%, then that\u2019s negligible. But despite the recommended caution for the 8 weeks starting September, he thinks the volatility does not translate into a tough full-year. He views this pullback as a buying opportunity, believing that the market has not yet reached its peak for 2024.\nAs Lee encourages investors to be ready to buy the dip, we are here with a list of the\u00a0most buzzing stocks to buy now.\nNote: All price/volume data is as of September 6.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing, and networking solutions, and is majorly known for manufacturing graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips are essential for rendering graphics, but they\u2019re also used in AI, machine learning, and data centers.\nRecently, Elon Musk announced that Colossal, an AI training system, had been brought online by his AI startup, xAI. The system is powered by 100,000 H100 GPUs made by NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA). For comparison, Google\u2019s AI model uses 90,000 GPUs while Meta\u2019s uses 70,000. H200 and the rumored Blackwell-based GPUs are slowly replacing the H100 GPUs.\nMusk has already announced that Colossal would double in size by shifting to H200 GPUs in the coming months. He claims only 50,000 replacement H200 GPUs would achieve size doubling. The Blackwell chips are even faster and more efficient, the top-end capacity being 36% higher than the H200 and 66% higher in total bandwidth.\nIn FQ2 2025, the company recorded a year-over-year improvement of 122.40% in revenue. Data center revenue was up 54% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45%\u00a0 of data center revenue.\n179 hedge funds held the company\u2019s shares.\u00a0Fisher Asset Management\u00a0is the biggest shareholder with shares worth $11.54 billion, as of June 30. In late August, management also approved a buyback of $50 billion in equity shares.\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces pressure to launch new products to maintain investor confidence. Delays in Blackwell chip production and concerns about high GPU prices impact the demand. The company\u2019s future success depends on effective AI monetization. By the end of fiscal year 2025 and each year after, it aims to achieve and maintain 100% renewable electricity for its offices and data centers.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put, Nvidia\u2019s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported better-than-expected fiscal first quarter results driven by strong demand from data centers. Additionally, management noted that large cloud service providers, contributing approximately 45% of data center sales, recognize the high return on investment offered by Nvidia\u2019s computing solutions, which are driving AI spending. The company also introduced its next-generation H200 chip, which nearly doubles the inference performance compared to the H100 chip, enhancing how trained AI models process new data. Lastly, management raised their fiscal second quarter guidance, noting that demand for their current H100 chips remains strong, and that demand for their next generation products is estimated to outstrip supply over the next year. We continue to believe the company is well positioned to potentially benefit from the growing AI data center workloads, which are driving demand for the increased interconnections and fully accelerated software stacks, thereby enabling leading application performance and fast result times.\u201d\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list the most buzzing stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has taken a unique approach to leadership, favoring relentless dedication over termination. In a recent interview, Huang clarified that while he demands a lot from his employees, he's not quick to fire anyone. Instead, he opts to \u201ctorture them into greatness,\u201d a strategy he says has propelled Nvidia to the forefront of the tech industry.\nDon't Miss:\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communitiesnow harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nHuang believes that his tough love, making employees work every day of the week and sometimes staying as late as 2 a.m., sets Nvidia apart. \u201cWhen you fire somebody,\u201d Huang said, \u201cyou are informing him, \u2018It was not your mistake\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m the one who made the mistake.\u2019 But I truly believe people can change. They need to learn.\u201d He drew upon his humble beginnings and said, \u201cI used to clean bathrooms, and now I\u2019m the CEO. If I can learn and grow, so can others.\u201d\nThe 61-year-old CEO, who is worth $111 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, underscored his commitment to personal development. \u201cI am constantly learning from the 60 people reporting directly to me,\u201d Huang said. He added that this drive for continuous improvement is why he refuses to give up on his employees. \u201cIt's tongue in cheek, but people know I'd rather push them to be great than see them fail.\u201d\nTrending:\nHere\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\nHuang likened his management style to that of a dedicated coach. \u201cCoaches who believe in their team push them hard because they know their potential,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, people are so close to accomplishing something great. I just don\u2019t want to see them give up when they\u2019re right on the edge.\u201d\nDespite the intense work environment, which some employees have described as a \u201cpressure cooker,\u201d Nvidia workers stick around. The lure? Generous stock compensation packages have made many long-term employees multimillionaires.

Last year, it lost only 5.3% of its workers, and the turnover rate fell further when Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization briefly blew past $1 trillion. This compares to an average annual turnover rate in the chip industry of 17.7%.\nRecently, a group of current and former Nvidia employees spoke to Bloomberg News and acknowledged the tough conditions and the reasons they stayed. \u201cYes, it\u2019s tough, but the rewards are worth it,\u201d said one employee.\nTo Huang, the formula is simple: Challenge people, take them to the limit, but never give up on them.

        "Title": "Should You Buy Nvidia 3 Months After Its Stock Split? Here's What History Says.",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has roared higher over the past five years, even soaring past $1,000 early in 2024. This occurred as the company built its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, generating triple-digit revenue and profit growth, quarter after quarter.\nA stock price around or past the $1,000 mark isn't always accessible for every investor. Recognizing this, Nividia launched a stock split in early June.\nStock splits lower the per-share price of a company's stock through the issuance of additional shares to current holders. These moves don't change anything fundamental about a company, though, so they don't actually make the stock cheaper. However, the lower price still may attract investors who weren't ready to shell out hundreds of dollars or more prior to the split.\nNow, as we head into the third month after the split, it's fair to take a look at Nvidia's performance so far and consider whether this stock-market darling can keep on soaring. Let's look to history for some help.\nThe company announced the plan to split its stock back in May, when shares were trading for more than $900. After the announcement, they quickly climbed past $1,000. The stock went on to gain nearly 30% from the announcement date through the split on June 7. The 10-for-1 split ratio meant the stock opened at about $120 on June 10.\nSince that time, Nvidia's shares have experienced a few ups and downs, but overall, they've lost about 4%. So we're far from the typical Nvidia performance we saw earlier in the year and throughout 2023.\nWhere are Nvidia shares heading next? History shows us that in 2 of the 3 previous Nvidia stock splits, after the first three months post-split, the stock went on to climb in the double digits over the next two months. But in the case of the other split, the shares fell in the double digits during that period.\nJust using that historical example, Nvidia's performance months after a stock split has been mixed, but leaning toward positive.\nNow let's consider broader data regarding stock splits. Overall, in a study from 1980 through today, companies that have split their stock have outperformed the S&P 500, according to a Statista report using Bank of America's Research Investment Committee data. Stocks that split posted an average total return of more than 25% in the 12 months following the announcement, twice the average return for the S&P 500 during that time, data shows.\nWhy is that the case? The idea is that by lowering a stock price, more investors will flock to a stock, offering a boost. While this may be partly true, this isn't the only element investors look at. They won't buy a stock just because it completed a split.\nIn the case of Nvidia, investors have started to worry about growing competition in the AI chip market, and concerns about the broader economy have taken root, too. Economic uncertainty generally weighs on high-growth companies like Nvidia because they rely on solid economic conditions to support their businesses. These factors, along with some profit-taking, have held Nvidia back in recent times.\nAs for what's ahead, history tells us Nvidia has a good chance of advancing in the coming months if the stock follows historical patterns. But history doesn't always repeat itself, so I wouldn't buy Nvidia today to make a quick gain. The good news, though, is Nvidia still has plenty of gas in the tank to deliver gains over the long term.\nThe company is about to launch its new Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever, and Nvidia promises to update its chips on an annual basis. This should keep revenue roaring higher. Of course, some customers will opt for a rival's lower-priced chip or use some of Nvidia's along with some of the rival's.

This increase in demand led to a 30-35% rise in data center capacity in 2021, as organizations sought to support remote work and ensure the continuity of their operations.\nThe pandemic also underscored the importance of data centers in maintaining business operations and delivering essential services. Data centers became the backbone of remote work, online education, telemedicine, and other critical services that became indispensable during the pandemic. As a result, the data center market experienced accelerated growth, and this trend is expected to continue as businesses and individuals increasingly rely on digital solutions.\nGeopolitical events, such as the Russia-Ukraine crisis, have also impacted the data center industry. The ongoing conflict has led many companies to reassess their operations in the region, with some choosing to suspend or withdraw their services. For example, SAP SE announced in March 2022 that it would halt sales of new products in Russia and shut down all data centers in the country. This situation highlights the need for data center operators to have resilient and adaptable strategies to navigate geopolitical uncertainties.\nRegionally, North America remains a dominant force in the data center market, holding a substantial market share. The region\u2019s dominance is attributed to significant investments by major players and the high adoption of advanced technologies. In 2021, North America saw the launch or construction of over 100 data center projects, with major colocation service providers and hyper-scale operators leading the way.\nThe IT infrastructure segment holds the largest market share within the data center industry. This segment encompasses the hardware, software, and network components required to support data center operations. As businesses continue to migrate towards data center solutions for improved data management and operational efficiency, the demand for IT infrastructure is expected to grow.

        "Title": "Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Comments on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "In this article, we\u2019ll share Jim Cramer's latest comments about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). First, we will take a look Cramer's analysis of the market sentiment.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer described September 6, Friday, as a dismal trading day following a critical non-farm payrolls report. Bulls hoped for weaker-than-expected hiring and steady wages to prompt the Federal Reserve to consider cutting rates. They got what they wished for, but this led to a surprising turn of events: instead of rallying, the market saw a sharp decline, with the Dow falling 410 points, the S&P dropping 1.73%, and the NASDAQ plummeting 2.55%.\n\"What an ugly day. Just hideous. We came into today knowing we\u2019d have a critical non-farm payrolls report. If you were a bull, you wanted to see weaker-than-expected hiring with wages pretty much in line, because that\u2019s what the Fed needs to see before it can start cutting rates. Voila, we got exactly what we wished for. Maybe we should have been careful, though, because as soon as we got what we wanted, the bulls vanished and the sellers came out of the woodwork, crushing practically everything.\nCramer noted that September often brings significant profit-taking, making it historically the weakest month for the market. While this might seem like circular reasoning, it's more plausible than suggesting that fear of a severe economic slowdown drives the sell-off. In fact, big tech companies, which are central to ongoing powerful trends like data centers and accelerated computing, should be seen as buying opportunities during market dips.\n\"This market has a September problem. Come September, we\u2019re always hit with a tremendous amount of profit-taking, which is why it\u2019s the weakest month of the year. I know that\u2019s somewhat circular reasoning\u2014we sell because we\u2019ve always sold\u2014but it makes more sense than saying people sold tech because they fear a hard landing. Tech, especially big tech, is something you buy, not sell, into weakness if you're worried about a more severe slowdown.\nJim Cramer discussed the aftermath of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s recent report, noting that despite his belief that AI is not a bubble, the stocks related to AI have seen substantial gains, particularly in August. He pointed out that September often triggers increased selling, even when companies report results that meet expectations.\n\"Look at what happened after the company reported last night. I don\u2019t believe AI is a bubble, but these stocks are still up a great deal, especially in August. And September tends to bring out sellers when you get just in-line numbers.\"\nJim Cramer also commented on the upcoming debate between Vice President Harris and former President Trump, scheduled for Tuesday night. He questioned how much the economy will be a focus, speculating that Trump might try to link Harris to recent inflation trends, while Harris may present herself as a more moderate alternative to President Biden.\n\"Tuesday night\u2019s the great debate between Vice President Harris and former President Trump. I don\u2019t know how much of a role the economy will play in the debate. If Trump\u2019s on his game, he\u2019ll try to tie Harris to the inflation we\u2019ve experienced since COVID. I suspect that Harris will try to portray herself as more moderate than President Biden. Either way, I doubt there\u2019ll be anything specifically market-moving, even if the candidates say something newsworthy about their tax plans. Keep in mind that the winner in November likely won\u2019t have the Senate votes to totally rework the tax code, whether we\u2019re talking about Harris\u2019s capital gains tax or Trump\u2019s 19th-century-style tariffs.\"\nThen he discussed the upcoming release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday, which will provide another update on inflation. He emphasized that if inflation remains steady or decreases, the Federal Reserve will have more flexibility to lower interest rates and potentially avoid a recession, addressing concerns from many sellers. Cramer urged investors to stay confident and not to abandon their positions based on these uncertainties.\n\"Wednesday, we get another read on inflation\u2014this time from the Consumer Price Index. What can I say? As long as inflation stays the same or goes lower, the Fed has plenty of leeway to cut interest rates and prevent a recession\u2014the thing so many sellers are worried about. That\u2019s why I keep telling you, please do not give up the ship here.\"\nA week ago on Friday Cramer urged his viewers not to dwell on the day-to-day movements of NVDA stock:\n\" When you look at NVIDIA on forward earnings or estimates, it always looks expensive, and then it so far trumps those estimates that when you look backward, it turns out the stock was selling at a remarkably low price. That's been the secret to NVIDIA literally since 2012\u2014incredible! It just keeps doing that, right? Please don\u2019t put too much significance on day-to-day gyrations in a stock's share price. You have to know when something is a signal and when it\u2019s all just sound and noise, always signifying nothing.\"\nCramer shared a similar sentiment on Wednesday as well:\n\"What about tech weakness as a recession signal? I keep hearing Nvidia may have missed its quarter due to economic softness. Let\u2019s put that rumor to bed. The issue wasn\u2019t demand; it was Nvidia\u2019s inability to produce enough of its high-end Blackwell chips due to supply constraints. This wasn\u2019t a demand issue.\nNVDA is ranked 6th on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 179 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the second quarter which was 186 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Adrian Volenik ",
        "Text": "Most individuals consider established markets \u2013 places with plenty of customers and money to be made \u2013 when they think about launching a new product or beginning a business. However, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang takes a different approach. He\u2019s more interested in \u201czero-billion-dollar markets.\u201d By adopting this unconventional strategy, Nvidia has become one of the most valuable businesses globally. What does he mean by this, and how can it be useful to you?\nDon't Miss:\nUnlock a $400 billion opportunity by investing in the future of EV infrastructure on this startup already valued at $50 million with just $500.\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nA zero-billion-dollar market is one that doesn\u2019t exist yet. Put another way, there are neither competitors nor customers because no one has considered it or dared to invest in it. This approach is risky because the results aren\u2019t guaranteed, but they may be very lucrative if they succeed. Jensen Huang\u2019s mission is to find and turn these unexplored niches into thriving industries.\nTrending: General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\nSo, why does Jensen love these markets? The reason is simple: no competition. When you're the first to enter a brand-new market, you set the rules, define the product and have a chance to become the leader. Huang's experience with Nvidia shows this perfectly.\nIn the early 2000s, he bet big on \"accelerated computing\" with CUDA technology. This wasn't an established market \u2013 nobody was buying GPUs for AI computing because AI computing as we know it today didn't exist. But Huang believed in it and invested in it, and now Nvidia dominates the AI chip market.\nSee Also: Don\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\nEntering a market that doesn't exist might sound like setting up a lemonade stand in the desert, but it's more strategic than that. Here's why:\nIf there are no customers, there are no competitors either. You don't have to fight over market share with established giants.\nBeing first means defining the standards and creating a strong brand identity.\nThe market may be worth zero dollars today, but it could be worth billions tomorrow if you're right about its potential.\nTrending: Teens may never need wisdom teeth removed thanks to this MedTech Company \u2013 Be an early investor for just $300 for 100 shares!\nYou don't have to be a tech giant to use this approach. Whether you're an entrepreneur, a small-business owner, or just someone with a big idea, here's how you can apply Huang's philosophy:\nThink about areas in your life or industry with unmet needs or unsolved problems. These are potential zero-billion-dollar markets.\nDon't be afraid of small beginnings. When Netflix started, DVDs by mail seemed like a crazy idea. They were solving a problem no one knew they had. Now, they're a global powerhouse. Small, seemingly niche ideas can grow into major industries.\nBuilding something new takes time and patience. Nvidia didn't become a leader overnight \u2013 it took years of investment and belief in a market that no one else thought was viable. So, be prepared for the long game.\nEmbrace failure and learn from It. Not every zero-billion-dollar idea will work, and that's okay.\nAs Huang puts it, \u201cI'd rather be a market maker, market creator than a market taker. [It] is a good way to cause the company to think about how to go create something for the first time.\u201d\nRead Next:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "Title": "Why Is Nvidia (NVDA) Up 5.5% Since Last Earnings Report?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Nvidia (NVDA). Shares have added about 5.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Nvidia due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\nNVIDIA reported better-than-expected results for second-quarter fiscal 2025. The chip maker reported non-GAAP earnings of 68 cents per share for the aforementioned quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.3%. The reported figure soared 152% year over year while increasing 11% sequentially. Higher revenues, as well as improvement in gross margin and operating margin, drove the robust increase in earnings.\nFiscal second-quarter revenues climbed 122% and increased 15% sequentially to $30.04 billion. The robust growth in the top line was mainly driven by record sales in the Data Center end market and higher sales across the Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive end markets. The top line also beat the consensus mark of $28.42 billion.\nNVIDIA reports revenues under two segments \u2014 Graphics and Compute & Networking.\nGraphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and personal computers, the GeForce NOW game-streaming service and related infrastructure. The segment also offers solutions for gaming platforms, Quadro GPUs for enterprise design, GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing as well as automotive platforms for infotainment systems.\nGraphics accounted for 12% of fiscal second-quarter revenues. The segment\u2019s top line soared 16% year over year while increasing 7% sequentially to $3.59 billion. Our fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimates for the Graphics segment was pegged at $3.81 billion.\nCompute & Networking represented 88% of fiscal second-quarter revenues. The segment comprises the Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, the DRIVE development platform for autonomous vehicles and Jetson for robotics as well as other embedded platforms.\nCompute & Networking revenues soared 154% year over year and 17% sequentially to $26.45 billion. Our fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimate for this segment was pegged at $24.33 billion.\nBased on the market platform, revenues from Data Center (87.4% of revenues) jumped 154% year over year and 16% from the previous quarter to $26.27 billion. This robust rise was mainly driven by higher shipments of the Hopper GPU computing platform that is used for the training and inference of large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications. Our estimate for this end-market\u2019s fiscal second-quarter revenues was pegged at $24.51 billion.\nNVIDIA witnessed strong demand for its chips used in the Data Center by all customers in both compute and networking markets. During the fiscal second quarter, large cloud providers represented 45% of Data Center revenues while the remaining stemmed from consumer internet and enterprise companies.\nGaming revenues increased 16% year over year and 9% sequentially at $2.88 billion, accounting for 9.6% of the total revenues. The year-over-year surge reflects increased sales of its GeForce RTX 40 series family of GPUs (graphics processing units) and game console system-on-chips. Our estimate for the Gaming end-market\u2019s second-quarter revenues was pegged at $2.77 billion.\nProfessional Visualization revenues (1.5% of revenues) increased 20% year over year and 6% sequentially to $454 million. The increase was primarily driven by the ramp of RTX GPU workstations based on the Ada architecture. Our estimate for the Professional Visualization end-market\u2019s fiscal second-quarter revenues was pegged at $475.7 million.\nAutomotive sales (1.2% of revenues) in the reported quarter totaled $346 million, up 37% on a year-over-year basis and 5% sequentially. The increase was mainly driven by AI cockpit solutions and self-driving platforms.\u00a0 OEM and Other revenues (0.3% of revenues) were up 33% year over year and 13% sequentially to $88 million. Our estimate for the Automotive and OEM end markets\u2019 fiscal second-quarter revenues were pegged at $294.6 million and $86.4 million, respectively.\nNVIDIA\u2019s non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 75.7% from 71.2% in the year-ago quarter, driven by higher Data Center sales and benefits from favorable component costs. However, non-GAAP gross margin contracted 320 basis points (bps) sequentially due to a higher mix of new products within the Data Center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses increased 52% year over year and 12% sequentially to $2.21 billion. The increase was due to higher compensations and related benefits. However, as a percentage of total revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses declined to 9.3% from 13.6% in the year-ago quarter and 9.6% in the previous quarter.\nThe non-GAAP operating income jumped 156% year over year and 10% sequentially to $19.94 billion, driven by higher revenues. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by 880 bps to 66.4% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s 57.6% due to higher gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Sequentially, non-GAAP operating income contracted 290 bps due to a reduction in gross margin partially offset by lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.\nNVIDIA\u2019s non-GAAP net income margin of 56.4% for the second quarter improved 650 bps year over year but contracted 210 bps sequentially. This was the first time the company witnessed a sequential contraction in net income margin following eight quarters of improvement.\nAs of July 28, 2024, NVDA\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $34.8 billion, up from $31.44 billion as of April 28. As of July 28, the total long-term debt was $8.46 billion, unchanged sequentially.\nNVIDIA generated $14.5 billion in operating cash flow, up from the year-ago quarter\u2019s $6.3 billion but down from the previous quarter\u2019s $15.3 billion. In the first half of fiscal 2025, it generated an operating cash flow of $29.8 billion. NVIDIA generated a free cash flow of $13.48 billion in the second quarter and $28.42 billion in the first half of fiscal 2025.\nIn the fiscal second quarter, the company returned $246 million to shareholders through dividend payouts and repurchased stocks worth $7.16 billion. In the first half of fiscal 2025, the company paid out $344 million in dividends and bought back stocks worth $14.9 billion.\nAt the end of the second quarter, it had a remaining share-repurchase authorization of approximately $7.5 billion. The board of directors recently approved a new $50 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing the total authorization to $57.5 billion, which has no expiration time.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2025, NVIDIA anticipates revenues of $32.5 billion (+/-2%). The non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 75% (+/-50 bps). Non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated at $3 billion.\nDuring its second-quarter earnings conference call, NVIDIA revealed that it has executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield and has shipped the same in the second quarter. It is expected to start ramping up the production of Blackwell in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and continue through fiscal 2026.\nEarlier, NVIDIA stated that the ramp-up of Blackwell production will begin in 2024. However, the latest update signals that the production ramp-up could now start by the end of January 2025.\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.\nThe consensus estimate has shifted 7.26% due to these changes.\nCurrently, Nvidia has a strong Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Nvidia has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Opinion: Nvidia's $50 Billion Buyback Is Not a Reason to Buy the Stock Hand Over Fist. Here's What I'm Concerned About.",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "On Aug. 28, Wall Street held its breath as the world's most important artificial intelligence (AI) company reported second-quarter earnings. I'm talking about Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), of course. While each member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is seen as an indicator for the direction of all things AI, Nvidia has emerged as perhaps the industry's end-all-be-all barometer.\nBut fear not! Once again, Nvidia silenced the doubters after posting yet another spectacular earnings report. However, while combing through the financial and operating metrics, I discovered one announcement that left me a little perplexed.\nNamely, Nvidia's board of directors approved an additional $50 billion in share repurchases (this comes on top of a remaining $7.5 billion from a prior buyback program). There's a general notion that stock buybacks can be quite favorable for investors. But in the case of Nvidia, I just don't get it.\nBelow, I'll break down some reasons why I think Nvidia announced the buyback and why I do not see this move as a reason to buy the stock right now.\nOne of the bigger announcements from Nvidia this year was the company's 10-for-1 stock split, which occurred back in June. Since early September 2022, shares of Nvidia have risen over 750%. As the stock price eclipsed $1,000 per share, building a position in Nvidia became more of a hurdle for some investors.\nSometimes, a company will choose to split its stock following these significant rises in the share price. Although a stock split does not inherently change a company's market capitalization, the lower split-adjusted price is often perceived as less expensive and may inspire investors to buy. As a result, a stock could actually become more expensive following a split as a larger body of investors starts to pour in.\nThis isn't exactly the case with Nvidia stock, though. Since shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on June 10, Nvidia stock has declined by about 2% (as of market close on Sept. 2). I'll concede that a 2% drop is not a reason to panic. But with that said, I am a little surprised that the split did not inspire a noticeable uptick in buying activity and subsequently propel Nvidia's valuation to new highs.\nTo be candid, I see the announcement of the buyback as somewhat of a PR stunt and an effort to reinspire investors.\nImagine watching a commercial in which a celebrity you admire endorses a product, but later, you learn that the celebrity has never used the product and simply promoted it because they were paid a fee to do so. In a way, that's sort of what's going on with Nvidia right now.\nWhile adding to the existing buyback initiative might give the impression that management views the stock as a good buying opportunity or even undervalued, keep in mind that insider selling has become all the rage at Nvidia over the last couple of months. Executives, including Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang; executive vice president of operations, Debora Shoquist; and board members Mark Stevens and Tench Coxe were all selling stock when Nvidia shares were riding high earlier in the summer.\nWhy should you buy Nvidia stock when those responsible for generating shareholder value are cashing out? Perhaps this is a harsh criticism, as Nvidia's executives still own large chunks of stock -- making their net worth closely tied to the performance of the business. Nevertheless, I have some other concerns regarding the buyback.\nWhile Nvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), not too long ago, I wrote a piece on how the company is deploying its record profits into growth initiatives outside its core semiconductor and data center businesses. Moreover, considering Nvidia's closest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), has made several notable acquisitions over just the last couple of years, I would think management would be motivated to double down on research and development, marketing, and other endeavors amid intensifying competition. I would see those as more prudent decisions, considering Nvidia did have to delay orders on its newest Blackwell GPUs due to a design flaw.\nOne last point I'd like to make pertains to competition outside of AMD. Nvidia is also facing surging competition from its own customers -- particularly some of the Magnificent Seven members. Electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla relies heavily on Nvidia chips to develop autonomous driving software. But recent remarks from Elon Musk suggest Tesla is looking to migrate away from Nvidia and perhaps compete with the chip giant in the future. Moreover, both Amazon and Meta are increasing investments in capital expenditures (capex), specifically in some projects revolving around designing their own in-house semiconductor chips.\nIf you look at Nvidia purely from a valuation perspective, there's an argument to be made that the stock is a bargain right now. On price-to-earnings (P/E)\u00a0and price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) bases, Nvidia stock is actually less expensive today than it was even just a few years ago -- and that's with all of this newfound revenue and profit growth.\nBut I'm beginning to have some concerns that Nvidia is hard-pressed to identify opportunities to allocate capital amid a period of rising competition. I'm not going to put forth the notion that investing in Nvidia is a disastrous choice. I'll save the doomsday-speak for another time.\nHowever, investors should realize that Nvidia's record growth across the top and bottom lines will not last forever. Eventually, growth will normalize and take a toll on Nvidia's profits. For that reason, I find the $50 billion buyback questionable and not reason alone to scoop up shares of Nvidia at the moment.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia expected to produce 450,000 Blackwell AI GPUs in Q4 \u2014 potential $10B in revenue for the chipmaker",
        "Author": "  Anton Shilov ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nAnalysts from Morgan Stanley believe that despite\u00a0low yields\u00a0caused by\u00a0a significant yet easy-to-fix design issue, Nvidia will produce around 450,000 AI GPUs based on the\u00a0Blackwell\u00a0architecture. If the information is accurate and the company manages to sell these units this calendar year, this could translate into a revenue opportunity of over $10 billion.\n\"Blackwell chips are expected to see 450,000 units produced in the fourth quarter of 2024, translating into a potential revenue opportunity exceeding $10 billion for Nvidia,\" analysts from investment bank Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients, reports\u00a0The_AI_Investor, a blogger that tends to have access to this kind of notes.\nWhile the $10 billion and 450,000 numbers look significant, Nvidia will sell its high-demand Blackwell GPUs in short supply for around $22,000 per unit, down significantly from the rumored\u00a0$70,000 per Blackwell GPU module. Although the actual pricing of data center hardware depends on factors like volumes and demand, selling the very first batches of ultra-high-end GPUs at lower prices compared to Nvidia's current-generation H100 is a bit odd.\nNvidia would, of course, prefer to sell 'reference' AI server cabinets powered by its Blackwell GPUs: the NVL36 featuring 36 B200 GPUs, which is expected to cost $1.8 million \u2013 $2 million, and the NVL72, with 72 B200 GPUs inside, which is scheduled to start at $3 million. Selling cabinets instead of GPU, GPU modules, or even DGX and HGX servers is much more profitable, and earning $10 billion by selling such machines is not unexpected. However, in this case, Nvidia will not need to supply 450,000 GPUs to earn $10 billion in revenue.\nIn late August, Nvidia said that it had to change the codenamed B100/B200 GPU photomask design to improve production yield. The company also noted that the GPUs will enter mass production in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 (which begins in late October for the company), Nvidia is expected to ship 'several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue,' significantly lower than the sum mentioned by Morgan Stanley analysts.\nAccording to a\u00a0SemiAnalysis\u00a0report, a mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of Blackwell chiplets and packaging materials caused the failure. Nvidia's B100 and B200 GPUs are the first to use TSMC's CoWoS-L packaging, which links chiplets using passive local silicon interconnect (LSI) bridges integrated into a redistribution layer (RDL) interposer. The precise placement of these bridges is crucial, but a mismatch in CTE between the chiplets, bridges, organic interposer, and substrate causes warping and system failure. Nvidia reportedly had to redesign the GPU's top metal layers to improve yields but did not disclose details, only mentioning new masks. The company clarified that no functional changes were made to the Blackwell silicon, focusing solely on yield improvements.\nDue to the necessity of changing the design of B100 and B200 GPUs and the shortage of TSMC's CoWoS-L (a vastly different method from the proven CoWoS-S technology) packaging capacity, analysts did not expect Nvidia to ship many Blackwell-based GPUs in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024 or the fourth quarter of the company's fiscal 2025.\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other American tech stocks.\nTech stocks have outperformed the stock market for several years and account for over 30% of the market's overall holdings. With market values estimated at trillions of dollars, the majority of the lauded Magnificent Seven stocks are American tech companies that are still expanding. Technology is constantly evolving, and investors have a lot of opportunities because of this ongoing advancement.\nThis dynamic progress was reflected in the US stock market when it rose more than 3% in the second quarter of 2024. In terms of the trade in artificial intelligence, technology companies remained at the top, and this trend did not appear to be slowing down throughout the quarter. The largest companies have outperformed the market this year, which has been a remarkable trend. The 500 largest companies' large-cap market saw gains of 4.4% in Q2 YoY, increasing its 2024 return to above 15%. In contrast, the small-cap market saw a 3.3% drop, translating into a 1.6% 2024 return.\nEven though technology companies outperformed in Q2 FY2024, Main Street Research's James Demmert cautions investors not to treat all of them the same. Instead, they should prioritize those tech firms that can deliver consistent earnings, especially in an uncertain economy.\nInvestors should also stay informed about the 2024 tech industry statistics. According to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, almost one-third of the growth in the US economy is attributed to the IT sector, which is the main driver of the country's economy. Similarly, the United States accounts for one-third of the world's information technology market, according to the International Trade Administration, making it the largest tech market in the world. Computer and IT jobs reported a median annual wage of $104,420 in May 2023, while 108,503 college graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer and information sciences graduated in 2022, a 3.5% increase YoY. The average yearly salary for tech majors is $90,000.\nAccording to a report, tech trends in 2023 were dominated by electrification/renewables and generative AI. Internet searches for generative AI increased by 700%, and the area received significant funding as huge language models processed more data and expanded modalities. Even while global IT investment declined, electrification and renewables continued to draw large amounts of capital. These industries continue to have a high volume of job postings, signifying potential for long-term growth.\nLooking forward, according to the Deloitte 2024 technology industry outlook, in the wake of current macroeconomic headwinds such as high inflation and supply chain disruptions, the technology industry confronts a cautious 2024 recovery. As per Deloitte's Q4 2023 study, 62% of tech executives believe the industry is \"healthy,\" with growth anticipated in the areas of cybersecurity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. By late 2024, generative AI is expected to have a major impact on enterprise software and elevate operational efficiency. Tech companies and startups are investing more in AI, but enterprise adoption is still sluggish. However, this is predicted to change in the second half of 2024. Market expansion is anticipated to be propelled by enterprise expenditure on AI and IT services. Nonetheless, regulations in the EU and the US focusing on data privacy, sustainability, and AI ethics continue to provide challenges, forcing companies to follow regulations while leveraging these for competitive advantage. To reduce geopolitical risks and guarantee uninterrupted growth, supply networks will need to strategically change, and effective operations will need to be prioritized.\nWe sifted through holdings of tech ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 25 American tech stocks. Then we selected the 13 stocks that had the lowest percentage of their shares shorted. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the lowest percentage of their shares shorted.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n% of shares shorted: 1.20%\nIndustry-leading parallel processing is provided by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs, which were formerly required for PC gaming applications but are now also needed for cryptocurrency mining, artificial intelligence, and possibly other applications.\nThe company's dominant position in the market for graphics processing units, or GPUs, and the hardware and software tools required to support the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence business gives it a competitive advantage. Eventually, analysts predict that the largest tech companies will work to identify alternatives to NVDA or internal resources to broaden their AI offerings. However, these initiatives will probably erode rather than completely replace Nvidia's leadership in this field, as it is the leading AI chip vendor.\nThe American tech firm has recently released NIM Agent Blueprints, an AI workflow catalog that can be customized and used by enterprise developers to build and implement generative AI systems.\nNvidia revealed second-quarter 2025 earnings and a third-quarter outlook that exceeded FactSet consensus predictions, demonstrating that the company is still operating at full capacity. The unending demand for graphics processing units, or GPUs, and associated goods used in data centers to power artificial intelligence has kept Morningstar analysts optimistic about Nvidia. Nonetheless, the firm's earnings beat wasn't as spectacular as it has been in previous quarters, which is why the shares declined after hours.\nCiting solid Q2 2025 performance and ongoing high demand from significant areas like Hyperscalers, Enterprises, and Sovereign nations, Philip Woo of Phillip Securities reaffirmed a Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a $155 target. Nvidia's dominance in AI GPUs and a promising outlook for 2025 and 2026 lend credence to his optimism.\nThe AI chip maker behemoth has hedge fund sentiments of 179 in Q2 2024. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest shareholder in the company, with 2,501,400 shares worth $3.85 million.\nOverall NVDA ranks 8th on our list of the best American tech stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s 10 Handpicked Stocks to Watch.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Jim Cramer's other handpicked stocks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed concern that there\u2019s too much negativity in the market despite recent movements. He pointed out that while the Dow gained 38 points on Wednesday, the S&P fell 1.16%, and the NASDAQ dropped 3%, people seemed overly focused on what was going wrong. Although he\u2019s not calling it a market bottom, he suggests it\u2019s worth paying attention to what\u2019s going right.\n\"On a day when the Dow inched up 38 points, the S&P dipped 1.16%, and the NASDAQ declined 3%, I\u2019m willing to declare that there\u2019s too much doom and gloom out there. Look, I\u2019m not trying to call a bottom, let\u2019s make that crystal clear, but I think it\u2019s worth taking a hard look at what\u2019s actually going right\u2014not just what\u2019s going wrong.\"\nCramer emphasized that even though the market has been strong this year, heading into a historically tough election season and the worst month of the year means it\u2019s not the time to declare everything is fine. He noted that according to his trusted S&P oscillator, which measures overbought or oversold conditions, the market isn\u2019t oversold yet, so it's risky to go all-in.\n\"Sure, the market\u2019s up a lot this year as we head into a tricky election period and historically the worst month of the year. So, only a fool would ring the all-clear bell. Plus, we aren\u2019t even oversold yet\u2014at least not according to the S&P oscillator I swear by, which gauges whether there\u2019s too much buying or selling compared to normal times. You don\u2019t go all-in when the market is overbought like it is now; that rarely works.\"\nCramer also countered the idea that a recession is inevitable due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s struggle to control the economy. He agreed the economy is slowing, which is why consumer packaged goods and utility stocks are rallying while more sensitive sectors are struggling.\n\"At the risk of sounding too bullish, let me refute some of the biggest and baddest stories out there. First, let\u2019s tackle the popular narrative that the economy is slowing at a faster pace than the Federal Reserve can control, leading to an inevitable recession. That\u2019s why consumer packaged goods stocks and utilities are rallying while economically sensitive stocks have been crushed. I won\u2019t deny that the economy is weakening.\"\nHowever, he stressed that a Fed rate cut is meant to counter economic weakness, not strength, and hoping for a rate cut while ignoring the downturn is unrealistic. He added that if the upcoming labor report is weak, recession-proof stocks may surge, but if it\u2019s strong, hopes for a rate cut will fade.\n\"But let\u2019s be realistic: You can\u2019t hope for a Fed rate cut without acknowledging that there\u2019s going to be some economic fallout. The Fed doesn\u2019t cut rates when business is booming. That\u2019s foolish thinking. Rate cuts are meant to combat economic weakness, not strength. If Friday\u2019s labor report is weak, sure, we might see a huge rally in the so-called \"recession-proof\" stocks. But if the non-farm payroll number is too strong, forget about any rate cut hopes. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\"\nOur Methodology\nThe article summarizes a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed and recommended several stocks. This article focuses on ten companies that Cramer highlighted and examines how hedge funds perceive these stocks. The companies are ranked based on their level of hedge fund ownership, starting with the least owned and moving to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nJim Cramer addressed concerns about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s stock weakness and whether it signals an impending recession. He clarified that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s recent quarter wasn\u2019t impacted by low demand but rather by supply issues with its high-end Blackwell chips. The problem was not with demand but with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s ability to produce enough chips due to these constraints. He noted that such fluctuations in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s market cap are not unprecedented and will likely occur again.\n\"What about tech weakness as a recession signal? I keep hearing Nvidia may have missed its quarter due to economic softness. Let\u2019s put that rumor to bed. The issue wasn\u2019t demand; it was Nvidia\u2019s inability to produce enough of its high-end Blackwell chips due to supply constraints. This wasn\u2019t a demand issue.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading player in the tech industry, particularly in AI, gaming, and high-performance computing. For Q2 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported record revenue of $13.51 billion, up 101% from the previous year, driven by a massive surge in demand for AI chips. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s data center revenue soared by 171% to $10.32 billion, reflecting the growing need for GPUs in AI applications like generative AI and large language models.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s net income also jumped to $6.19 billion from $656 million a year earlier, and its earnings per share reached $2.70, exceeding Wall Street's forecast. Recent updates highlight NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s expanding role in AI. In August 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) introduced its next-generation AI chip, the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which is designed to further accelerate AI tasks.\nOverall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of Jim Cramer's handpicked stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "NetApp, Inc. NTAP recently announced an advancement in generative artificial intelligence (AI), combining its data management expertise with NVIDIA\u2019s NVDA AI software and accelerated computing. The partnership is aimed at boosting enterprise retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which will unlock the power of next-gen agentic AI.

        "Title": "These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks May Be Better Buys Than Nvidia for the Blackwell Launch",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Chipsets known as graphics processing units (GPUs) are an integral component in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. At the moment, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) holds an estimated 88% of the AI GPU market thanks to its industry-leading A100 and H100 GPUs.\nIn the coming months, Nvidia is set to add another GPU -- called Blackwell --to its roster. During the company's most recent earnings call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said \"demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply\" and that the new chipsets were forecast to generate billions in revenue by the fourth quarter.\nWhile Blackwell appears to be a short-term tailwind for Nvidia, I see two other stocks as potentially better opportunities in the long run.\nHere's why I think Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) could be more savvy buys for the upcoming Blackwell launch.\nSupermicro is an IT infrastructure company that specializes in storage cluster and server rack designs for GPUs. Soaring demand for GPUs over the last couple of years has been a major catalyst for Supermicro's business.\nWhile the Blackwell GPUs should ignite new opportunities among IT architecture specialists, I'm anticipating that Supermicro will be a particular beneficiary given the company's strong relationship with Nvidia. With that said, there are some important things to note about Supermicro's business right now.\nFirst, the company's latest earnings report from early August was a mixed bag. While revenue continues to grow at an impressive rate, the company's gross margin is a glaring issue.\nIn general, Supermicro's business is going to carry lower margins compared to a software business or a company that has outsize pricing power, such as Nvidia. The reason for this is that designing storage clusters requires hefty capital expenditures (capex), which can take a toll on profit margins.\nIn addition to the financial results, Hindenburg Research recently published a short report alleging that Supermicro's financial controls and accounting practices are weak. It is important for investors to understand that short-sellers such as Hindenburg benefit when a stock price goes down -- as is the case with Supermicro right now -- but this is not the first time Supermicro has been at the center of accounting-related accusations. In 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission fined Super Micro Computer and its CFO for violating federal securities laws by \"engaging in improper accounting -- prematurely recognizing revenue and understating expenses from at least fiscal year ... 2015 through FY 2017.\"\nFurthermore, the company is set to execute a 10-for-1 stock split in the next week; such an event will almost certainly trigger some momentum-driven trading activity.\nLastly, on Sept. 26, The Wall Street Journal reported that unnamed sources told it the Department of Justice (DOJ) is probing Supermicro and seeking information apparently tied to allegations of accounting violations.\nHowever, at this time details are sparse. I would let this situation play out before fleeing and writing Supermicro off.\nOn top of all of this, investor uncertainty surrounding macro factors such as interest rate tapering from the Federal Reserve have also influenced selling activity in the market over the last several weeks.\nSupermicro stock has been experiencing quite the precipitous sell-off as of late, and much of this revolves around a mixture of hearsay, panic selling, and the macroeconomy.\nRight now, Supermicro's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is just 14 -- nearly 72% off its highs from earlier this year. Moreover, this pales in comparison to the S&P 500's forward P/E of 23.\nThis discount to prior valuation levels could make Supermicro stock a compelling opportunity as the Blackwell launch sits on the horizon.\nEarlier in the summer, Elon Musk's AI start-up, xAI, tapped Dell and Supermicro for server rack designs for its GPU clusters. Although this deal came with high-profile headlines, Dell's entire infrastructure solutions group (ISG) is a winning operation.\nDuring its second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Aug. 2), Dell had $3.2 billion in AI-optimized server orders and ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in backlog.\nFrom a revenue perspective, ISG increased 38% year over year to a record $11.6 billion. Within ISG, sales from servers and networking equipment rose 80% year over year to $7.7 billion. Meanwhile, storage revenue of $4 billion actually dropped nominally year over year by 5%.\nI see the Blackwell launch as an additional catalyst for Dell's ISG segment across both servers and networking as well as storage solutions. To me, Blackwell should help spur even more demand for Dell's infrastructure solutions. I suspect investors could begin to get a glimpse of Blackwell's impact on Dell by looking at backlog details in upcoming earnings reports.\nI think buying Supermicro stock right now comes with some risk, considering its shares will likely continue experiencing outsize volatility leading up to the split on Oct. 1 and as details of any government probe emerge. In the long run, however, I think the Blackwell GPUs will be a catalyst for Supermicro's services and newfound demand could ignite a rebound in the stock.\nWhile Dell's forward P/E of 14.9 is in line with that of Supermicro, I see the company as the more prudent investment right now since there is less hoopla surrounding the company compared to its peer.\nNevertheless, I see both Supermicro and Dell as beneficiaries of the Blackwell launch and think the growth spurred from these new GPUs will last quite a long time. For these reasons, investors may want to consider positions in each as Nvidia's newest chipset release looms.\nBefore you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Dell Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Investors hoping to score returns from artificial intelligence (AI) turned heavily toward Nvidia. Its leadership in the chip industry led the stock to massive gains, and investors who missed out likely remain on the sidelines hoping to buy.\nUnfortunately, it appeared priced for perfection, and even a strong earnings report could not stop it from falling.\nStill, investors can benefit from AI while gaining additional support from the consumer sector. If you want to enjoy the best that both tech and the consumer sectors offer, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) could serve you well.\nAlthough investors should consider today's Amazon a conglomerate, most appear to associate it with its massive retail operations. Yet despite an enormous $1.9 trillion market cap, Amazon remains in growth mode.\nUnder most circumstances, the law of large numbers would indicate slowing growth due to Amazon's size. However, it has circumvented this issue with an ingenious business model. The most sizable part of its business, online sales, has become a slow-growing business that appears to act as a loss leader.\nInstead, Amazon derives most of its operating income from Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business. AWS pioneered this industry, which grew to $600 billion as of 2023, according to Grand View Research. Grand View also estimates it will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% through 2030, taking the market's size to $2.3 trillion by that year.\u00a0AWS also gives Amazon a critical role in supporting AI, making it an essential part of the world's IT infrastructure.\nProfit levels are not reported for most of its businesses on the consumer side. Nonetheless, it is likely the positive operating income from its other sectors comes from advertising, third-party seller services, and subscriptions. These enterprises have successfully leveraged the benefits of retailing and IT, resulting in double-digit revenue growth for several quarters.\nMoreover, despite its massive size, Amazon can still grow overall revenue at double-digit levels. In the first two quarters of 2024, it reported $291 billion in revenue, rising 11% compared with the same period in 2023. Of that, AWS made up $51 billion, or 18% of total revenue, compared with $110 billion generated by online stores, its original business.\nHowever, as mentioned before, AWS continues to make up the majority of operating income, accounting for $19 billion of Amazon's $30 billion in operating income reported for the first half of 2024. After including non-operating expenses and income taxes, Amazon earned $24 billion in net income during the period, compared with just $10 billion in the first half of 2023.\nAmazon stock continues to climb, rising by just over 25% over the last year. Additionally, between its stock and the rising profits, Amazon's P/E ratio has fallen to a surprisingly low 43, close to a multiyear low.\nAdmittedly, the triple-digit net income growth over the last year is likely unsustainable. Still, analysts forecast 31% average annual profit growth over the next five years. Although that is a way-too-early prediction, if earnings growth is close to that level, Amazon's current valuation could make it resemble a faster-growing value stock, making its investment case all the more compelling.\nIf you're looking for a safe consumer and AI-oriented stock at an affordable price, you may have a hard time clicking on a more fitting stock than Amazon.\nIndeed, at a $1.9 trillion market cap, most companies would struggle to achieve high-percentage growth. Yet Amazon has almost defied the law of large numbers by establishing a number of smaller, higher-profit businesses centered around a popular but possibly unprofitable online sales enterprise.\nSuch a business model serves investors because it offers the safety of a large, multifaceted enterprise, yet contains smaller businesses that drive significant growth.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) now has a market cap of about $2.5 trillion, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. The stock has enjoyed an incredible rally in the past couple of years, and even though it has been declining in recent weeks, it's still up by an amazing 115% since January.\nWhile there are plenty of opportunities for the leading artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker's business to grow, because it now trades at such a high valuation that it could take a while for investors who buy it today to reap a high return from the stock.\nThat's why it's worth considering other AI stocks that may have more upside, and which can benefit from strong demand for Nvidia's AI chips. One stock such stock that looks like an underrated AI investment today is Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL).\nComputer maker Dell reported some outstanding sales numbers in its fiscal 2025 second quarter. And what was remarkable was that the strong results weren't due to rising personal computer (PC) sales. Instead, it was robust demand for its servers.\nIn the period, which ended on Aug. 2, Dell's net revenue climbed by 9% year over year to just over $25 billion. And the top line could have been even better if not for its sluggish performance outside of its server business. During the quarter, the company's server and networking revenue grew by an incredible 80% to $7.7 billion. That offset declines in its core client solutions group, where sales were down by 4%.\nThe company is benefiting from an increase in demand for its servers as businesses look to find ways to accommodate greater workloads due to AI. This is where Dell has a great opportunity to continue to grow its server sales at a high rate.\nDell's numbers were good last quarter, but I'm optimistic that they can get even better. Upgrade cycles could be coming for notebooks and PCs as consumers and business customers look to take advantage of AI-powered machines. Research company Gartner forecasts that by the end of 2026, AI PCs will account for all enterprise PC purchases. This year, it estimates that around 22% of PCs shipped will be AI-powered.\nOnce demand for PCs and notebooks gets going again thanks to that AI tailwind, Dell's overall growth rate could quickly accelerate. The company could be growing at rates well into the double-digit percentages once it's firing on all cylinders with multiple AI-related growth catalysts.\nNvidia and Dell are both potentially good stocks to buy and hold if you're bullish on AI. But Dell trades at just 13 times the company's expected future profits (based on analyst expectations) -- a much cheaper valuation than Nvidia, which trades at more than 36 times next year's earnings.\nDell could also be on the cusp of achieving much better growth numbers in the near future, and buying the stock before that happens could set investors up for some fantastic returns in the long run. It may take some patience given the possibility of a recession in the near future, but Dell may be a terrific AI stock to buy and hold right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Dell Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks on the market since the technology exploded in popularity toward the end of 2022. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are witnessing massive demand because of their ability to train large language models (LLMs) and handle inference workloads.\nHowever, the recent price action suggests that Nvidia investors are now looking for alternatives to capitalize on the AI boom. Shares haven't exactly taken off following the release of Nvidia's fiscal 2025 second-quarter results late last month. Investors are probably skeptical of Nvidia's prospects because the company has grown at an incredible pace in recent quarters, and it may possibly head toward an eventual slowdown.\nFor instance, Nvidia's year-over-year revenue growth projection of 80% for the current quarter would be slower than the 122% growth it recorded in the previous quarter. It is also worth noting that the chipmaker finished fiscal 2024 with a 126% spike in revenue to $60.9 billion. Analysts are forecasting its top line to increase by a similar margin this year to $125 billion. But, as the following chart shows, Nvidia's growth is expected to taper off over the next couple of fiscal years.\nOf course, there is more to Nvidia's business than just the AI chip market. The company has a huge addressable market worth $1 trillion that could help sustain its outstanding growth for a long time to come. But even then, investors on the lookout for AI stocks that present better value right now would be tempted to look for alternatives. This is where Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) step in.\nLet's look at the reasons why buying these two AI stocks instead of Nvidia could be a smart move.\nDell may not be a household name in the field of AI yet, but a closer look at the company's recent results and the nature of its business tells us that it could gain big from the growing adoption of this technology in the long run.\nThe company, which is known for manufacturing server platforms, personal computers (PCs), and peripherals, released its fiscal 2025 second-quarter results (for the three months ended Aug. 2) late last month. Dell's revenue increased 9% year over year to $25 billion, driven mainly by the healthy demand for the company's servers that are being used for mounting AI chips.\nMore specifically, Dell's infrastructure solutions group (ISG) revenue shot up 38% year over year to a record $11.6 billion. What's worth noting is that Dell's server revenue alone increased by a tremendous 80% from the same quarter last year to $7.67 billion. AI servers accounted for $3.1 billion in revenue last quarter, suggesting that the company is now getting a good chunk of its revenue from this fast-growing market.\nWhat's more, Dell's AI server backlog stood at a healthy $3.8 billion at the end of the previous quarter. Management added that its \"AI server pipeline expanded across both tier 2 CSPs and Enterprise customers again in Q2 and now has grown to several multiples of our backlog.\" That's not surprising as the AI server market is growing at a stunning pace.\nAccording to one estimate, annual sales of AI servers could hit a whopping $430 billion in 2033 as compared to $31 billion last year. So, there is a good chance that Dell's server revenue could keep growing at a healthy clip in the long run.\nAt the same time, investors should note that there is another serious AI-focused catalyst for Dell in the form of the PC market. Market research firm Canalys estimates that the AI-enabled PC market could jump from annual shipments of 48 million units this year to 205 million units in 2028. Dell is the third-largest PC vendor in the world with a market share of 15.5%, which means that it is in a solid position to capitalize on this lucrative market.\nThe company's client solutions business, which accounts for sales of commercial and personal computers, was down 4% year over year in the previous quarter at $10.5 billion. However, Dell points out that it expects the incoming PC refresh cycle to drive a recovery in this business. In all, Dell sees an incremental revenue opportunity of $174 billion thanks to AI.\nSo, it won't be surprising to see the company's growth accelerating in the future. It has already raised its guidance for the current fiscal year and the discussion above indicates that it could keep raising its growth expectations because of AI. Attractively valued at just 14 times forward earnings, Dell's healthy long-term prospects could translate into impressive gains.\nQualcomm is another incredibly cheap stock one can consider buying right now to take advantage of the growing adoption of AI in the smartphone and PC markets. It is currently trading at just 15 times forward earnings.\nAs one of the leading players in the smartphone processor space with an estimated market share of 31% in the second quarter of 2024, up from 29% in the same quarter last year, Qualcomm is well placed to capitalize on the booming AI smartphone demand. Counterpoint Research estimates that the global generative AI smartphone market could witness a 4x jump in shipments between 2023 and 2027.\nThe company has already established a solid lead in this market, as per Counterpoint, with half of the generative AI smartphones expected to be powered by its chips in 2024. Its main rival, MediaTek, is expected to have a market share of just 13% in AI smartphones this year. More importantly, Qualcomm is now clocking healthy double-digit growth thanks to the proliferation of AI smartphones.\nThe company's revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 11% year over year to $9.4 billion. Its adjusted earnings grew at a stronger pace of 25% to $2.33 per share. The company's revenue in the first nine months of the current fiscal year has increased by 5% to $28.7 billion. Analysts are expecting Qualcomm's top-line growth to accelerate to almost 10% in the next fiscal year.\nThe chipmaker's growth rate could continue to accelerate because of its dominant position in the market for AI smartphone chips. Observers have already seen how Nvidia's dominant position in the AI data center graphics card market has translated into stunning growth in the company's revenue and earnings. Qualcomm could follow in the footsteps of its more illustrious peer and could see its revenue and earnings growth getting supercharged thanks to the lucrative opportunity it is sitting on.\nAs such, investors should consider using the stock's attractive valuation to buy more shares as an acceleration in its growth could eventually lead to healthy stock upside in the long run.\nBefore you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Dell Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "For the better part of two years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been the hottest thing since sliced bread on Wall Street. The prospect of AI-driven software and systems learning without human intervention gives this technology broad-reaching utility in almost every sector and industry.\nThough we've seen no shortage of next-big-thing trends come and go on Wall Street since the advent of the internet three decades ago, none have offered as large of an addressable market as artificial intelligence. Based on a report issued by researchers at PwC, AI is forecast to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030.\nWhile a number of stocks have soared on the heels of the AI revolution, no company has benefited more than semiconductor goliath Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nIn the blink of an eye, Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) became the undisputed top choice by businesses looking run generative AI solutions and train large language models. Nvidia's H100 chip has been backlogged due to excess demand, while its successor chip, Blackwell, is estimated to be sold out well into 2025. Blackwell is set to make its debut during the first quarter of next year.\nThe beauty of AI-GPU demand overwhelming supply is that it puts the ball completely in Nvidia's court when it comes to pricing power. Nvidia's GPU hardware has consistently been priced at a 100% to 300% premium to competing chips -- and businesses are eagerly lining up to pay this higher price. Over the last six quarters, Nvidia's adjusted gross margin has expanded by more than 10 percentage points, largely thanks to this otherworldly pricing power.\nDuring the fiscal second quarter of 2025 (ended July 28), Nvidia delivered sales growth of 122% and reported just a hair over $30 billion in sales. For some context on just how quickly Nvidia has ramped its sales, it generated a little north of $6 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\nBut while it's looked every bit like Wall Street's textbook growth stock, Nvidia threw the ultimate smoke-and-mirrors curveball to investors with one aspect of its latest report.\nWith professional and everyday investors looking for Nvidia to report blowout second-quarter sales growth and hype up its future hardware and software offerings -- the company's CUDA software toolkit has played a key role in keeping enterprise clients loyal to its AI-GPUs -- Nvidia delivered the news that its board had approved a $50 billion share repurchasing program. This comes atop the $7.5 billion remaining from a previously announced buyback allotment.\nThe purpose of buyback programs is to signal to investors that a company's board believes its stock is being undervalued by Wall Street and investors.\nFurthermore, buying back stock has the ability to reduce a company's outstanding share count, which can provide an upward lift to earnings per share (EPS). In other words, it can make a stock more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\nHowever, devoting up to $50 billion to a buyback program isn't something you'd expect from a hypergrowth company that's expected to spend a small fortune on researching and developing new products and services tied to the AI revolution.\nOne reason this is a complete smoke-and-mirrors move is because the company is dangling the prospect of repurchasing an additional $50 billion worth of its stock at a time when insiders are selling their shares at a historic pace. Since the midpoint of June, CEO Jensen Huang has disposed of around $600 million worth of his company's stock. Net insider selling activity has topped $1.6 billion over the trailing-12-month period.\nTo add to the above, no insider has purchased a single share of their company's stock on the open market since Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress bought 200 shares in (wait for it...) December 2020!\nIf this isn't egregious enough, Nvidia is attempting to signal that its stock is undervalued at a time when its shares are historically pricey, relative to its trailing-12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio.\nThroughout history, you can count on one hand how many times we've witnessed market-leading companies approach a TTM P/S ratio of 40. The last time this occurred, both Amazon and Cisco Systems went on to lose around 90% of their respective value following the bursting of the dot-com bubble.\nDangling the carrot of buybacks at a time when Nvidia's valuation is historically expensive is the ultimate smoke-and-mirrors campaign.\nLooking beyond Nvidia's head-scratching share repurchase announcement, investors should also note the warning history provides when it comes to next-big-thing innovations, technologies, and trends.\nWhile there's no question that big dollar figures tied to large addressable markets can lead to emotion-driven euphoria on Wall Street, history has repeatedly shown that every highly touted innovation, technology, and trend over the last 30 years has, eventually, navigated its way through an early stage bubble.\nThe catalyst for this bubble is investors who consistently overestimate the adoption and/or utility of next-big-thing trends. Although artificial intelligence has a promising future, the simple fact that most businesses lack a well-defined game plan to grow their sales and increase their profits is a glaring warning that investor expectations are outpacing reality.\nHistory also tells us that every game-changing technology has needed time to mature. It took more than a half-decade for business-to-business commerce to find its footing following the proliferation of the internet in the mid-1990s. It's going to take time for businesses to figure out what they have with AI and how to best utilize the technology to meet the needs of their customers.\nLong story short, a $50 billion share repurchase program doesn't hide the fact that Nvidia's insiders are big-time sellers, the stock is historically pricey, and no highly touted innovation has escaped an early innings bubble for three decades.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is undoubtedly one of the hottest stocks in the market and has been for a few years now. Its position as a provider of key hardware for the artificial intelligence (AI) space has fueled quarter after quarter of triple-digit growth for its sales and earnings.\nWhile the stock has gained nearly 750% since the beginning of last year, it has charted a somewhat rocky course over the past few months. But Nvidia looks on track to keep growing sales of its high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) and remain the industry's dominant supplier.\nThe company's recent successes and its new place in the popular consciousness come almost exclusively from AI, where tech giants like Meta Platforms and Alphabet have been spending lavishly to build supercomputers and new AI data centers.\nThis isn't an overnight success story, though. The company has been providing rapid processing power to the video gaming and graphics markets since the early 1990s. Its GPUs previously transformed video game graphics and helped build that industry into what it is today.\nMore recently, the company saw a mini-boom during the last major crypto bull market as cryptocurrency miners scooped up its GPUs to power the machines that mine proof-of-work coins. Still, none of those successes can really compare to the last two years.\nA $1,000 investment made in Nvidia five years ago would be worth more than $28,000 today (with dividends reinvested).\nI'm sure many people wish they bought shares of Nvidia back in 2019, or better yet, back in 1999 when the company went public. But hindsight is 20/20, and there's no need to beat yourself up for missing out. Unless you're the luckiest investor in history, you're going to miss some opportunities.

It ranked fourth on our screen last week of semiconductor companies expected to increase their revenue most quickly through calendar 2026.\n\u2018He has never paid rent or utilities:\u2019 Do I have the legal and moral authority to charge my brother rent to live in our family home?\n\u2018He was in the early stages of dementia\u2019: My father put my brother on the deed to his house. His lawyer had a big conflict of interest. What do we do?\nHere\u2019s the 8% return investors in cash could be missing out on. Psst, it relates to the housing market.\nAfter Fed\u2019s 50-basis-point rate cut, where should I invest $50,000? I\u2019m 38 \u2014 and have a high risk tolerance.\u00a0\nMy girlfriend and I are having a symbolic \u2018wedding.\u2019 She does not want to lose her health benefits \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to lose my shirt. Is that wise?\nThere are various dynamics at play when it comes to Nvidia shares. Given all the recent attention on the company, some of the enthusiasm for future growth is already baked into the share price. Investors have even started to nitpick growth that would be the envy of nearly every other industry player, but which marks a slowdown relative to Nvidia\u2019s recent levels.\nRead: Nvidia among chip stocks declining. Here\u2019s what buyers are waiting for.\nAt the same time, Nvidia shares have come down from their June highs, and the broader chip sector is down from July. In light of those pullbacks, analysts\u2019 consensus price targets still imply considerable upside for shares, as today\u2019s screen will show.\nToday we have done a different type of stock screen for the semiconductor industry, based on ratings and consensus price targets among analysts polled by FactSet. Nearly all analysts working for brokerage firms set price targets looking out 12 months, based on their own projections for companies\u2019 financial results.\nBefore getting to the screen, let\u2019s take a look at the performance of the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, which tracks the performance of the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX by holding all 30 of its stocks.\nHere is a five-year chart showing the total return for SOXX through Monday, compared with that of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, which tracks the S&P 500 SPX.\nReturns include reinvested dividends and are net of the exchange-traded funds\u2019 expenses. SOXX has more than doubled the return of SPY over the past five years, but investors have needed to be patient, because this industry group tends to be more volatile than the broad market. It can be a rough ride. For example, in 2022, SOXX declined 35.1% while SPY was down 18.2%.\nInvestors have experienced the sector\u2019s volatility more recently than that as well. SOXX is down 17% from its July highs.\nMixed opinions: Why Nvidia and Broadcom shares can\u2019t save the chip sector by themselves\nThe S&P 500 is weighted by market capitalization. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is maintained by Nasdaq Inc. NDAQ and uses a modified weighting methodology, which caps its largest three components at 12%, 10% and 8%, respectively. The index is rebalanced quarterly, and you can learn more about the process it follows to adjust weightings here. As of the close Monday\u2019s close, the top holding of SOXX was Broadcom Inc. AVGO, with a 10.51% weighting, followed by Nvidia, at 9.07% and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, with a 7.76% weighting.\nNow, here\u2019s a chart showing returns for the previous five-year period, from Sept. 16, 2014, through Sept. 16, 2019:\nAnd now, to illustrate the compounding effect for dedicated long-term investors, here is a comparison of 10-year returns for SOXX and SPY through Monday:\nFor 10 years through Monday, SOXX\u2019s total return was more than triple that of SPY.\nFor the new screen, our list included the 30 components of SOXX, to which we added 31 more companies in the S&P 1500 Composite Index XX:SP1500 within the semiconductor industry, as determined by FactSet, or in the Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment Global Industry Classification Standard group, as per companies\u2019 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The S&P Composite 1500 Index is made up of the S&P 500, the S&P MidCap 400 Index MID and the S&P Small Cap 600 Index SML.\nWe narrowed the list to 54 companies covered by at least five analysts working at brokerage firms polled by FactSet. Then we narrowed further to 13 stocks rated \u201cbuy\u201d or the equivalent by at least 80% of the analysts. Here they are, sorted by 12-month upside implied by the consensus price targets:\nCompany\nTicker\nShare \u201cbuy\u201d ratings\nSept. 16 price\nConsensus price target\nImplied 12-month upside potential\nMicron Technology Inc.\nMU\n90%\n$87.18\n$167.85\n93%\nIchor Holdings Ltd.\nICHR\n100%\n$28.33\n$43.00\n52%\nAllegro MicroSystems Inc.\nALGM\n80%\n$22.68\n$33.88\n49%\nSemtech Corp.\nSMTC\n92%\n$40.06\n$55.60\n39%\nOnto Innovation Inc.\nONTO\n100%\n$189.46\n$261.21\n38%\nPower Integrations Inc.\nPOWI\n83%\n$58.58\n$80.20\n37%\nNvidia Corp.\nNVDA\n94%\n$116.78\n$149.49\n28%\nMarvell Technology Inc.\nMRVL\n94%\n$73.40\n$92.59\n26%\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

MU ranks first on this list, illustrating a disconnect between analysts\u2019 rampant enthusiasm for the company\u2019s artificial-intelligence opportunities and the recent downward move for the shares. They\u2019re down more than 40% from their June highs, reflecting concerns about industry growth outside of high-bandwidth memory, which is a technology that\u2019s become highly relevant in the AI era.\n\u201cWe expect the slowdown to be temporary given stable end demand across markets and disciplined supply,\u201d a Raymond James analyst wrote last week, adding that the data-center business still looks on track for more than 300% growth this year, fueled by AI interest.\nAs for Nvidia, which ranks seventh on the screen with 28% upside to analysts\u2019 average price target, analysts have noted a few recent blips, such as concerns about a less gigantic beat in the latest quarter and the potential for some margin pressure as the company works to ramp its new Blackwell chip offering.\nMost are undeterred, as 94% rate the stock a buy. \u201cYes, the numbers are so good (and moving so high, so fast) that investors worry about sustainability,\u201d Bernstein\u2019s Stacy Rasgon wrote recently. \u201cHowever, the time to worry is clearly not now.\u201d\nMarvell Technology Inc. shares MRVL, meanwhile, are off about 14% from their March highs, but analysts remain optimistic about upside potential. The company is dealing with a dynamic that highlights a broader industry trend: While AI demand is strong, fueling growth in the data-center segment, Marvell saw sharp year-over-year declines for all its other revenue segments last quarter.\nStill, there\u2019s enthusiasm for the company\u2019s AI opportunities, including in application-specific integrated circuits. The company \u201cremains convinced ASICs will be too complicated and time-sensitive for smaller competitors or even internal efforts to remain viable at the leading edge,\u201d Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis wrote recently.\nThen there\u2019s Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, which clocks in at the No. 10 spot on this screen. As with Marvell, AMD\u2019s high for the year came in March, not over the summer as was the case for SOXX. AMD shares were strong last year as investors saw the company as a \u201csecond source\u201d to Nvidia in the market for AI graphics-processing units. And while AMD serves that role, revenue from AI doesn\u2019t seem to be manifesting as quickly as bulls had been hoping for earlier in the year.\nAMD shares are down 28% from their high point hit in March. Analysts, on average, see 24% upside from current levels, based on their 12-month targets.\nOne year might not be sufficient time for a long-term investment to play out \u2014 even one for a company that\u2019s performing well. But this is the old Wall Street tradition and brokerage firms use their analysts\u2019 ratings and price targets when recommending individual stocks to clients.\nNo method of selecting stocks is perfect.

        "Title": "Nvidia stock loses $280 billion in value as it confronts the antitrust police",

        "Text": "Good morning.\nHere\u2019s a record Nvidia didn\u2019t want to set: the biggest one-day loss in market cap, down $280 billion yesterday as its shares sank 9.5% to close at $108. While the chipmaker is coming off a year of giddy highs, one factor that set yesterday apart was the arrival of a subpoena from the U.S. Justice Department to investigate whether Nvidia violated antitrust laws. (Another was investor fears of an economic slowdown.) DOJ officials want to know if the AI chipmaker makes it hard for buyers to switch or shop around.\nAntitrust officials are investigating other tech companies, too, so Nvidia is not alone. In fact, it\u2019s hard to think of a moment in history when so many faced antitrust scrutiny\u2014for monopolistic, hubristic, collusive or otherwise anti-competitive behavior. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan and her peers at the Department of Justice have targeted alleged anti-competitive behavior in industries ranging from aviation, pharma and grocery to financial services, fast food and energy. And, of course, Big Tech.\nThat\u2019s not intended to be a partisan stance. Antitrust rules are designed to make companies compete for our hearts and wallets. While America\u2019s three core federal antitrust laws were forged more than a century ago, how they get enforced varies widely for a range of reasons. President Joe Biden\u2019s Executive Order on Competition, signed in July 2021, argues that \u2018monopoly products\u2019 and \u2018economic consolidation\u2019 are significant impediments to a \u201cfair, open and competitive marketplace.\u201d And Khan\u2019s antitrust push is widespread, garnering criticism from nonpartisan observers. \nAs an example, let\u2019s leave tech and enter the world of fashion, where the FTC has sued to stop Tapestry\u2019s merger with Capri, arguing that bringing brands like Coach and Versace into the same house will give Tapestry \u201ca dominant share of the 'accessible luxury' handbag market.\u201d When I met with Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat earlier this summer, she noted that hers is not an industry that lends itself to monopolies. A judge might agree and toss out the case. But antitrust suits that don\u2019t hold up in court can still do a lot of damage as momentum is lost and people have to build again.\nMore news below.\nDiane Bradydiane.brady@fortune.comFollow on LinkedIn\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"
