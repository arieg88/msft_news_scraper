        "Text": "Nvidia's (NVDA) growth metrics aren't impressing Wall Street like they used to.\nNvidia reported earnings on Wednesday which showed the company's earnings and revenue grew more than 100% from the prior year. But it also marked the company's slowest year-over-year revenue growth, 122%, in a year, and the rate of growth compared to the prior year was less than half what Nvidia reported in the first two calendar quarters of 2024.\nShares were down as much as 3.5% early Thursday morning.\nAnd this growth slowdown, D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance, is the chief concern with the stock right now and why he maintains a Neutral rating on the AI juggernaut.\n\"Next year we're going to have, at the very least, decelerating growth and possibly at some point, revenue declines,\" Luria said.\n\"Where if you look at consensus estimates, sell-side estimates, they are for the growth to continue at very, very high rates that are very hard to justify considering Nvidia's revenue is these other companies margins.\"\nAt some point, Luria argued, the big tech hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META) are going to slow their spending. And given they represent the lion's share of Nvidia's current AI chip sales, that'd likely be a headwind to future revenue growth.\n\"The estimates for next year and the year after that are starting to get way, way out of control,\" Luria said.\nNvidia's earnings call was still rather upbeat. CEO Jensen Huang described the demand for the AI leader's new Blackwell chip as \"incredible.\" And plenty of Wall Street analysts remained bullish on the stock as fears about delays on the Blackwell chip were somewhat eased during the earnings call.\nBut for investors assessing a stock that has rallied more than 1000% since the start of the current bull market in October 2022, slowing growth appears to be a sticking point. As Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis wrote in a note to clients, Nvidia's guidance for current quarter revenue of $32.5 billion \u2014 plus or minus 2% \u2014 appeared to be \"good but not good enough.\"\nNvidia's results also didn't surprise Wall Street at the same pace that they had been.\nThe company posted its slimmest upside surprise to Wall Street's revenue expectations since the start of 2023. Its roughly 5% beat on earnings per share was the narrowest surprise since before the AI revolution kicked off in 2023, too.\n\"The size of the beat this time was much smaller than we've been seeing,\" Carson Group chief markets strategist, Ryan Detrick wrote in reaction to the earnings release.\n\"Even future guidance was raised, but again not by the tune from previous quarters. This is a great company that is still growing revenue at 122%, but it appears the bar was just set a tad too high this earnings season.\u201d\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Nvidia is on track to hit a $10 trillion valuation, analyst Beth Kindig says.\nKindig is forecasting strong growth and \"fireworks\" for the stock after its Blackwell launch.\nJensen Huang assured investors on Nvidia's next-gen AI chip, promising \"billions\" in revenue.\nNvidia is on track to more than triple in value, according to Beth Kindig, the lead tech analyst at I/O Fund.\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance on Thursday, Kindig said she foresees Nvidia notching a $10 trillion valuation over the long term. That implies monster gains for the $2.9 trillion AI titan, largely due to strong expected growth and gains from its next-generation AI chip, dubbed Blackwell, Kindig said.\nInvestors on Wall Street have grown concerned that Nvidia is becoming overvalued, given its massive run-up over the past year and investors' enormous expectations for earnings growth. Nvidia shares fell as much more than 6% Thursday after the company beat earnings for the second quarter, albeit more narrowly than previous quarters.\nInvestors also have concerns about Nvidia's Blackwell chip after industry analysts reported that the chip's launch would be postponed by two to three months due to \"major issues in reaching high production volume.\"\nKindig argues that Nvidia's results were still \"great,\" and enough to brush off investors' concerns heading into the results.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang defended the progress on Blackwell in a recent interview with Bloomberg, revealing that the company made a \"mass change to improve yield\" and was looking to pull in \"billions of dollars\" in revenue from the next-gen chip.\n\"That's why things are being revised up and they were never revised down,\" Kindig said of Nvidia estimates, adding that she remained positive on Blackwell's upcoming release. \"They're saying Blackwell is basically on time. Blackwell is not a concern. If anything, it's extremely bullish.\"\nKindig predicted that Nvidia's growth trajectory should become more apparent once Wall Street analysts upwardly revise fiscal estimates for the following year. That should be a \"big moment\" for Nvidia, followed by the release of shipping volume figures for Blackwell in 2025.\n\"That's going to be fireworks, is how I would put it. Absolute, ultimate fireworks for Blackwell will come in Q1, with that Q2 guide,\" Kindig said. \"Early next year will be fireworks again for Nvidia, and we will be on track for that $10 trillion.\"\nKindig's forecast for the chip company is among the most bullish, though Wall Street is still feeling optimistic about the chipmaker. Analysts have issued an average price target of $151 per share, per Nasdaq data, implying another 27% upside for the stock over the next 12 months.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) climbed over 1% in premarket trading on Tuesday, following a rise of up to 5% on Monday. This surge led to a broader rally in tech stocks as Wall Street continued to debate whether the recent slump in the semiconductor sector has been overdone.\nOn Monday,\u00a0Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya noted Nvidia is one of the firm's top \"rebound\" picks amid what he expects to be a comeback for semiconductors to end 2024.\n\"Our base case remains for a [semiconductor] rebound likely in Q4 as seasonal headwinds dissipate,\" Arya wrote in a note to clients.\nArya noted that Broadcom (AVGO) and KLA Corporation (KLAC) could also benefit from a rebound as they are the \"most profitable vendors in their respective end-markets,\" in addition to Nvidia.\nThe PHLX Semiconductor index (^SOX) is down nearly 18% in the last month, while Nvidia stock is off more than 15% over the same time period. The sector has been swept up in a rotation by market participants out of large-cap technology.\nArya reasoned that volatility is likely to continue through Nvidia's next earnings release on Aug. 28 and into September, which is historically the worst month of the year for semiconductor stocks. Arya noted that the current upward trend in semiconductor stocks has only been underway for four quarters, while prior runs have typically lasted for closer to 10 quarters.\nNvidia stock, in particular, has been under pressure amid growing concerns about the distribution of its Blackwell chip. Last week, The Information reported Nvidia's upcoming next-generation AI chips would be delayed by three months, potentially impacting big customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META).\nNvidia then issued a statement stating its next-generation Blackwell chip production \"is on track to ramp\" in the second half of the year. And Wall Street analysts believe the issue will be resolved.\n\"If it's really a supply or timing issue, I think most investors are willing to kind of look through that,\" KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst John Vinh told Yahoo Finance. \"If it was a demand issue, I think we'd have other issues here with Nvidia. But from our perspective, we think they'll beat and raise [earnings guidance]. We don't think near-term demand is going to be an issue at all.\"\nUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri maintained his Buy rating on the stock and a $150 price target in a note to clients on Monday while also remarking that he believes Blackwell customer volume shipments are likely delayed four to six weeks \"at most.\"\n\"Lead customers should have first Blackwell instances stood up in April 2025 timeframe,\" Arcuri wrote. \"AI labs are still upsizing and lengthening their instance commitments and enterprises are rapidly growing as a proportion of the demand mix \u2014 both bullish indicators.\"\nAdditionally, Arcuri argued the market may be underestimating Nvidia's future earnings growth. For now, Arcuri believes the market is currently pricing in peak earnings growth for Nvidia in 2025. But Arcuri argued that 2026 \"seems more likely to be up again given our customer discussions.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Sometimes your best just isn\u2019t good enough. That\u2019s the lesson Nvidia (NVDA) learned Wednesday after the company\u2019s stock price fell 3% despite posting better-than-expected second quarter earnings and guidance for the third quarter.\nIt\u2019s not as though the company\u2019s growth was unimpressive, either. Revenue jumped 122% year over year to $30 billion, up from $13.5 billion. Nvidia\u2019s all-important data center revenue topped out at $26.3 billion, a 154% year-over-year increase.\nBut that wasn\u2019t the kind of blowout that investors have quickly grown accustomed to over the last few quarters.\nBeyond investor sentiment, Wall Street analysts have also seemingly caught on to Nvidia\u2019s growth after several quarters of big surprises to the upside.\nNvidia\u2019s revenue reported Wednesday beat Wall Street expectations by 4.1%, the slimmest margin since the fourth quarter of its 2023 fiscal year.\nAs Nvidia\u2019s business has boomed over the last two years, the company\u2019s revenue topped Wall Street forecasts by double-digit percentage points for three straight quarters, including a 22% difference in its fiscal second quarter of 2024.\nAnd as Wall Street appears to have gotten a better feel for Nvidia\u2019s growth at this point in the AI investment cycle, questions have also arisen about the status of Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell chip.\nAhead of the company\u2019s earnings announcement, the Information reported that the chip, the follow-up to Nvidia\u2019s Hopper line, faced delays that could impact some of the company\u2019s biggest customers including Microsoft and Google.\nIn her quarterly comments, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress explained that the company made changes to Blackwell to improve its production yield. CEO Jensen Huang, meanwhile, said that the chip is currently being sampled to customers, a major step toward shipping the processor at volume.\nHuang said the company expects to ship several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in the fourth quarter. But the CEO couldn\u2019t pin down exactly how much revenue Blackwell would generate, despite analysts\u2019 questions.\nHuang, however, did provide a number of other strong points for Nvidia, including pointing out that demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply. The CEO also said that Nvidia\u2019s Hopper platform will continue to grow in the second half of the year, and explained that the company expects its data center business to grow \u201cquite significantly next year.\u201d\nHuang also said that AI inferencing is driving the company\u2019s data center revenue. Inferencing refers to computers running AI programs and providing users with answers to their queries.\nThat should put to rest fears of threats to Nvidia\u2019s long-term growth as companies pivot from training AI models to using inference. Huang appears to believe that Nvidia will continue to plow forward as customers use its chips to both train and run their AI models.\nNvidia is still the world leader in AI chips, and it\u2019ll be some time before rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) catch up to its hardware and software lead. And while Nvidia may be facing a near-term decline in its stock price, Wall Street is still on board.\nIn an investor note released following Nvidia\u2019s earnings, BofA\u2019s Vivek Arya raised his price target on the chip designer to $165 from $150 per share, writing, \u201cDespite the quarterly noise, we continue to believe in [Nvidia\u2019s] unique growth opportunity, execution and dominant 80%+ share as generative AI deployments are still in their first 1-1.5 [years] of what is at least a 3 to 4-year upfront investment cycle.\u201d\nRaymond James\u2019s Srini Pajjuri also raised the firm\u2019s price target on Nvidia\u2019s stock from $120 to $140, writing in an investor note that \u201cBlackwell delays appear better than feared and management is forecasting a strong ramp in FQ4.\u201d\nPajjuri also said demand for Nvidia\u2019s current-generation Hopper chip continues to be healthy and pointed to anticipated sales growth in Q4, despite Blackwell production ramping up at the same time.\nMorgan Stanley's Joseph Moore, who raised his price target for Nvidia from $144 to $150, called out Nvidia's sky-high expectations with regards to the company's stock moves after the earnings report.\n\"Expectations become more challenging as the superlative becomes mundane, but this was still a very strong quarter given the transitional nature of the current environment.\"\nWhether that\u2019s enough to satisfy investors next quarter remains to be seen.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Shares of AI giants Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) are down over the past three months, with Alphabet falling more than 6% and both Amazon and Microsoft down more than 3%.\nAnd second-tier AI players are struggling to regain traction as well. AMD (AMD) has fallen more than 16% since mid-July while Marvell Technology (MRVL) is off nearly 6% in the same period.\nBut strong results from Nvidia could reignite some of that lost momentum, according to Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives.\n\u201cNvidia is the heart and lungs of this bullish tech trade as the AI Revolution takes hold,\u201d Ives told me.\nIves, who expects a \u201cshock and awe\u201d quarter from Nvidia, said continued strong demand for the company\u2019s chips will have ripple effects across the industry. In a recent note to clients, Ives estimated that for every dollar spent on a Nvidia GPU chip, there is an $8 to $10 multiplier across the tech sector.\nBernstein\u2019s Mark Shmulik, who covers many of Nvidia's biggest customers including Meta (META), Amazon, and Google, told me the chip giant\u2019s results will be a critical driver of Big Tech\u2019s next move.\n\u201cNvidia is a bellwether of the 'Magnificent Seven' and AI trade,\u201d Shmulik explained. \u201cIf there is any softness, maybe rotation out of the Mag 7 picks up a little bit of steam, but listening to other tech earnings, core fundamentals keep delivering.\u201d\nSo far this year, Nvidia\u2019s stock has soared.

For Wall Street, the consensus remains bullish. KeyBanc, Citi, and Goldman Sachs were among those on the street who reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock this week ahead of results.\nWhile only time will tell whether Nvidia lives up to the hype this earnings season, it\u2019s safe to say the stakes are high.\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  Inan Dogan, PhD ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) just reported its latest earnings results. Nvidia's second-quarter earnings report exceeded expectations, with revenue reaching $30 billion, up 122% year-over-year and 15% quarter-over-quarter. This strong performance translated into adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.68, surpassing analysts' forecasts of $28.6 billion and $0.64, respectively. Yet, NVDA stock is down around 7% after hours. Why?\nTo answer this question, we have to take a look at NVIDIA Corporation's outlook for the current quarter. Here is what the company said:\n\u2022 Revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%.\n\u2022 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. For the full year, gross margins are expected to be in the mid-70% range.\nPhoto by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash\nNvidia's market cap before today's earnings report was $3.1 trillion. This means investors expect NVDA to earn around $140 billion per year once it becomes a more mature company like Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) which is currently trading at a forward P/E multiple of 21. NVIDIA Corporation's quarterly revenue and profit were $30 billion and $16.6 billion respectively though. Is it reasonable to assume that NVDA's quarterly profit can go from $16.6 billion today to $35 billion in a few years and then continue to grow at the same rate that GOOGL's quarterly profit is growing?\nInvestors were surprised to see that NVDA projected only an 8% quarterly revenue growth rate for its next quarterly report (vs. 15% for the last quarter). The decline in quarterly revenue growth rate is really concerning and if the decline continues, it will be awfully clear to investors that NVDA will never get to the $140 billion annual profit figure that its current stock price is demanding.\nI am Insider Monkey's co-founder and its research director. We have been recommending a long position in NVDA since May of 2023 and the stock's performance has been good to our subscribers. I also personally own a small position in NVDA shares. However, I believe that NVDA's revenue projections have disappointed investors and they are responding by selling their shares. This is a well-deserved crash and NVDA shares might decline even more tomorrow when the markets open. While I acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an AI investment, my conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders in the U.S. equity options market are expecting Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming earnings report to spark a more than $300 billion swing in the shares of the world's most dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker.\nOptions pricing shows that traders anticipate a move of around 9.8% in the company\u2019s shares on Thursday, a day after it reports earnings, data from analytics firm ORATS showed. That's larger than the expected move ahead of any Nvidia report over the last three years and well above the stock's average post-earnings move of 8.1% over that same period, according to ORATS.\nGiven Nvidia's market capitalization of about $3.11 trillion, a 9.8% swing in the shares would translate to about $305 billion, likely the largest expected earnings move for any company in history, analysts said.\nSuch a move would dwarf the market capitalization of 95% of S&P 500 constituents, including Netflix and Merck, according to LSEG data.\nThe results from Nvidia, whose chips are widely seen as the gold standard in artificial intelligence, also have big implications for the broader market. The stock is up some 150% year-to-date, accounting for around a quarter of the S&P 500\u2019s 18% year-to-date gain.\n\"It alone has been a huge contributor to the overall profitability of the S&P 500,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. \"It's the Atlas holding up the market.\"\nOptions pricing suggests traders are more concerned about missing out on a large upside move from Nvidia than getting hurt by a large drop.\nTraders are assigning a 7% chance the stock rises more than 20% by Friday, while only a giving a 4% probability to a more than 20% sell-off, according to a Susquehanna Financial analysis of options data.\n\"(Ahead of earnings) people typically want to buy hedges, they want to buy insurance, but in Nvidia's case, a lot of that insurance is FOMO insurance,\" Sosnick said, referring to the popular acronym for \"fear of missing out.\"\n\"They don't want to miss a rally.\"\nPart of the reason options traders are pricing this large a move for Nvidia has to do with how volatile the company's shares have been in the past.\nNvidia's average 30-day historical volatility this year - a measure of how much the stock has gyrated over a rolling 30-day period - is about twice the average of the same measure for all other companies with market caps higher than $1 trillion, according to a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data.\n\"The options are just reflecting how the stock is actually moving,\" said Christopher Jacobson, a strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group, which makes markets in the securities of Nvidia.\n\"(It's) is just a function of continued uncertainty/optimism with regards to AI and the ultimate size of the opportunity coupled with NVDA having become such a widely followed stock among institutional and retail,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Jonathan Oatis)\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA): The AI Boom Isn\u2019t Over Yet",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) has been a top-performing stock for several years, but the AI boom put this chip stock into the spotlight in 2023. Triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth became a regular occurrence each quarter and remains that way today. Some investors may be nervous about a bubble since Nvidia has gained so much, but I remain bullish on this stock and the AI opportunity. That\u2019s because Nvidia is outpacing its competition, capitalizing on the industry\u2019s explosive growth, and continuously innovating to maintain its dominant position.\nAs a refresher, Nvidia is known for designing and manufacturing graphics processing units (GPUs) that are widely used in gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and, most notably, artificial intelligence applications.\nArtificial intelligence\u00a0is still set\u00a0to expand meaningfully over the next few years. Data from Grand View Research indicates that the AI industry will maintain a\u00a036.6% CAGR\u00a0from now until 2030.\nWhile that\u2019s good news for AI companies\u00a0in general, it\u2019s even better news for Nvidia. That\u2019s because Nvidia is outgrowing the competition, and an expanding industry gives Nvidia more room to expand.\nRecent statements\u00a0from ex-Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) CEO Eric Schmidt revealed that many tech giants are ramping up their AI investments. He mentioned that some companies are ready to commit $20-100 billion in AI infrastructure. Many companies will benefit, but Nvidia will win the most from this development.\nNvidia has a vast technology lead over its competitors. Some of its offerings have\u00a0zero competition\u00a0and are critical for AI infrastructure. That rare advantage helps Nvidia set high prices for its products and services.\nWhile competitors are creating\u00a0their own\u00a0AI chips and resources, Nvidia is developing strong relationships with big tech companies. Nvidia also continues to innovate with new chips so it can constantly remain a few steps ahead of the competition. Even as tech giants create their own AI chips, they continue to work with Nvidia because the company is second to none in a booming industry.\nNvidia is the gateway into an industry that feels as revolutionary as the internet. Tech giants aren\u2019t\u00a0going to\u00a0give up on that type of opportunity, even if the cost of entry is high.\nObserving the guidance issued by other AI companies can\u00a0give a hint of\u00a0where Nvidia is heading. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is a Nvidia partner that has also benefitted from the AI boom, and its Fiscal 2025 outlook should be encouraging for Nvidia investors.\nSuper Micro generated $14.94 billion in Fiscal 2024 and projects that Fiscal 2025 revenue will range from $26.0 billion to $30.0 billion. After more than doubling its revenue year-over-year in Fiscal 2024, Super Micro is expected to achieve a similar result in Fiscal 2025. The company also mentioned that a Nvidia Blackwell delay\u00a0won\u2019t have much of an impact on its sales.\nRising demand for Super Micro\u2019s AI products indicates that Nvidia will experience robust demand growth in the upcoming quarters. Nvidia also issued optimistic earnings that suggest more growth is on the way for long-term investors.\nNvidia\u2019s revenue soared by 262% year-over-year in the\u00a0first quarter of Fiscal 2025. While it\u2019s an incredible number, it\u2019s even more impressive that investors have\u00a0been conditioned\u00a0to expect these\u00a0types of\u00a0growth rates from Nvidia. Further, net income jumped by 628% year-over-year, resulting in a 57.1% net profit margin.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang referred to AI as \u201cthe next industrial revolution\u201d in the firm\u2019s Q1 press release. Financials certainly paint that picture, as Nvidia\u00a0is expected\u00a0to generate revenue of $28.0 billion in the second quarter of Fiscal 2025, plus or minus 2%.\nHowever, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that Nvidia crushes that guidance. Not only does Supermicro\u2019s full-year guidance point to booming demand for the industry, but Nvidia beat its\u00a0own\u00a0guidance in the first quarter.\nThe AI leader announced\u00a0during its\u00a0Q4 FY24 results\u00a0that it expected to generate $24.0 billion, plus or minus 2%, in Q1 FY25.\u00a0As a pleasant surprise, Nvidia closed out the first quarter with $26.0 billion in revenue. That figure is 8.3% higher than Nvidia\u2019s guidance. Assuming Nvidia does something like that again, it\u2019s feasible that the company\u2019s total sales exceed $30 billion in Q2 FY25.\nNvidia is a\u00a0top stock to buy, according to Wall Street Analysts. Nvidia has earned 37 Buys and four Hold ratings in the past three months, giving it a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA stock price target suggests 16% upside from current levels.

        "Text": "One Nvidia (NVDA) bear warned the time has come for investors to sell.\nNvidia failed to meet sky-high expectations when it reported its fiscal second quarter earnings on Wednesday. Nvidia reported profits and revenue that topped forecasts but not by as much as investors hoped, delivering its smallest earnings beat in the last six quarters.\nNvidia stock fell 6% on Wednesday evening in reaction to the results and continued to slide 4% lower on Thursday afternoon. Year to date, the stock remains up nearly 140%.\nWhen asked when it might be time to sell, David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of Bahnsen Group, said, \"About a month ago. Two months ago. Today. Tomorrow.\"\n\"People are paying for perfection,\" Bahnsen added (video above). \"You're buying Nvidia banking on there being another investor who's a bigger sucker than you are.\"\nThe warning from Bahnsen comes as the stock has rallied 1,000% from its October 2022 lows. His call is based on one data point: Nvidia\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio, which sits just above 56 after earnings but neared 80 in July.\nHe offered a reminder that a company and its stock are not the same thing.\n\"This is not me bashing on Nvidia,\" Bahnsen said. \"This is a success story. I'm commenting on the valuation \u2014 that when you start paying those prices, the risk-reward skew becomes very unattractive.\"\nStill, it\u2019s a risk that the 89% of analysts with a Buy rating on the stock are willing to take. The stock has zero Sell ratings, which is understandable considering Nvidia posted $30 billion in revenue in the second quarter, a 122% increase over the same period last year.\nNvidia's future depends in part on other Big Tech companies. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) are responsible for 40% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue, according to Bloomberg estimates.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai indicated on the company\u2019s earnings call this quarter that the company's spending on artificial intelligence would not slow down. \u201cThe one way I think about it is when you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us,\u201d Pichai said.\nAlphabet's investment in AI, which represents a significant portion of Nvidia\u2019s revenue, could be a bullish signal to come. But those business fundamentals aren\u2019t the only focus.\n\"The estimates for next year and the year after that are starting to get way, way out of control,\" D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance.\nThe next big question for investors is whether the Street\u2019s reaction to Nvidia results this quarter will be enough to dampen earnings expectations heading into Q3.\nFor Bahnsen, it may already be too late.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "AI market darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has cooled off, dropping roughly 15% since peaking at a $3.3 trillion market cap just a few weeks ago. Despite the recent stumble, the stock has gained over 100% over the past year. Volatility is normal for any stock that rises so much in a short amount of time.\nBut Nvidia's current dip isn't an automatic buying opportunity. Question marks are starting to pile up as the company prepares to announce second-quarter earnings in a few weeks.\nHere are the risks investors should consider before buying the stock today.\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) race began in early 2023 with the viral arrival of ChatGPT. Nvidia's GPUs, which can optimize for AI applications using proprietary software, quickly established a dominant market share. Industry estimates have pegged Nvidia's AI market share as high as 70% to 95%. Research from TechInsights estimates Nvidia accounted for 98% of total data center GPU revenue in 2023.\nNvidia's financials back that up; revenue growth accelerated to nearly 300%. Technology CEOs like Elon Musk openly pleaded they couldn't get Nvidia's chips fast enough. Such high demand has done wonders for Nvidia's pricing power, too. Gross profit margins have expanded significantly to over 75%:\nBut it's hard staying on top when everyone is coming for your crown, and many of these big chip spenders may not enjoy being at Nvidia's mercy. It's known that competitors like Intel and AMD are pushing alternatives, and big technology companies like Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are building custom AI chips.\nAlphabet may have struck the first known blow to Nvidia's dominance. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) recently disclosed that it used 2,048 of Alphabet's TPU v5p chips to build the AI that will run on iOS devices. For its server AI model, Apple deployed 8,192 TPU v4 processors. These tensor processing units (TPUs) are purpose-built to train AI models. Apple didn't say it didn't use Nvidia chips, but omitted Nvidia when describing its hardware and software build.\nApple's tie-up with Alphabet is significant for multiple reasons.\nFirst, Apple's AI project is critically important, and the company chose Alphabet's chips despite the perception that Nvidia was the de facto industry leader and go-to chip vendor. It's just one instance, but it's now fair to question whether Nvidia's AI moat is as wide as initially thought.\nSecond, analysts' revenue estimates remain very optimistic despite potential competitive pressure. You can see that estimates for 2024 and 2025 are as high as ever:\nThird, genuine competitive pressures would likely threaten Nvidia's gross profit margins, which (as you saw in the first chart) have expanded beyond 75%. Over the past five years, Nvidia's gross margins have averaged 63%. Even if Nvidia retains the lion's share of the AI chip market, it may no longer do so at any price. Prices may have to come down to compete.\nThe potential downside in both revenue and gross margins should concern investors. I'm not saying that Nvidia can't or won't remain the leading AI chip company. But it's becoming increasingly plausible that deep-pocketed competitors can win business. Many of these big technology companies building custom AI chips are currently Nvidia's largest customers!\nMaybe the broader demand for AI chips will be so great that Nvidia can grow while ceding some of its market share. The risk is that it can't, that Nvidia's AI revenue could peak and then moderate or even decline as other AI chips flood the market. Q2 earnings could easily be another blowout quarter. Investors will want to pay close attention to management's full-year guidance, which should reveal future sales momentum.\nNvidia could prove volatile as Wall Street chews on these questions. Investors may want to consider waiting to see how Q2 earnings look before aggressively buying shares. At the very least, consider dollar-cost averaging your Nvidia investments. That's a smart way to manage uncertain markets or falling stock prices. By investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, you can lower your average cost per share over time. This method helps you buy more when prices are low, offering a strategic advantage in volatile markets.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "On Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) issued a better-than-expected fiscal second quarter report. However, its shares fell after the report, but still remain about 150% up for the year\u00a0as Nvidia continues to serve big companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN)\u00a0Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).\nFor the quarter ended in July, Nvidia reported its revenue surged 122% on a YoY basis as it topped $30 billion. After three straight quarters of YoY growth surpassing 200%, revenue of $30.04 billion still surpassed LSEG\u2019s estimate of $28.7 billion. Net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share while adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents surpassed LSEG\u2019s estimate of 64 cents.\nThe gross margin did slip to 75.1% from the first quarter\u2019s 78.4%, but it is up compared to last year\u2019s comparable quarter when it amounted to 70.1%.\nData center revenue surged 154% YoY to a record $26.3 billion. Before that business took center stage, Nvidia\u2019s primary focus was gaming that still brought in $2.9 billion as revenue grew 16% YoY. Its professional visualization business\u00a0reported revenue grew 20% YoY to $454 million while the automotive and robotics brought in revenue of $346 million.\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia guided for revenue of $32.5 billion, also surpassing StreetAccount\u2019s estimate of $31.7 billion as it expects YoY growth of 80% on the back of\u00a0strong Hopper\u00a0demand.\nDelay of Blackwell chip rollout.\nThe full-scale shipment of next-generation Blackwell AI chip is expected in the fourth quarter, bringing in several billion dollars to the revenue table, but analysts were expecting it\u00a0in the current quarter. Nvidia has made a change to the GPU mask to improve production yield and is now only sending samples to partners and customers. Its H100 and H200, are being used to fuel a majority of generative AI applications, such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, but CEO Jensen Huang noted that the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.\nCompetition is intensifying, but so are Nvidia\u2019s efforts.\nSecond to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) on the list of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, Nvidia continues to move fast, like AI and the narrative surrounding it. Its competitors are speeding up their AI efforts with Microsoft, Amazon, Google and\u00a0Meta\u00a0being on track to spend $185 billion on AI before 2024 comes to a close, according to a JPMorgan analysis.\u00a0Amazon alone focused on advancing its chip development to lower its reliance on Nvidia. During its last earnings call, Amazon also announced the updated versions of its Trainium and Inferentia chips. But even Amazon is still buying chips from Nvidia whose chips still remain a must for most complex AI tasks. Nvidia\u2019s biggest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) also surpassed earnings estimates with its latest quarter that ended on July 30th. While AMD has had a challenging few years, it is taking active steps to ensure a key spot in the AI field. With key acquisitions to strengthen its AI prospects, AMD is aiming to become a complete provider of AI solutions. Unfortunately for AMD and others, Nvidia is doing everything in its power to make it harder for them to catch up.\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The capital markets got off to a roaring start in 2024. However, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have given back some of their gains over the last month or so as equities have experienced some pronounced selling activity. As of the time of this article, shares of artificial intelligence (AI) darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) have fallen nearly 14% in the last month.\nWhile some of the decline can be attributed to sell-offs in the broader market, Nvidia recently hit investors with some disappointing news. Should investors be bothered by this dilemma, or is this a rare chance to buy the dip in AI's hottest stock?\nThere are a lot of factors influencing Nvidia stock's recent price action.\nFor starters, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4.3% in July -- its highest level in over two years. Moreover, recent commentary from the Federal Reserve continues to have economists questioning whether or not a cut to interest rates is on the horizon or not.\nAll things considered, the cloudy macroeconomic picture coupled with some typical election-driven volatility has surely caused some investors to start selling stock and hoard cash amid a pool of uncertainty. Unfortunately, this is only one side of the equation for Nvidia investors. Perhaps most concerning of all is that Nvidia's highly anticipated Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU) is facing delays due to design flaws, according to several media outlets.\nConsidering companies of all sizes and every industry are doubling down on generative AI investments, Nvidia's Blackwell delay doesn't exactly inspire confidence. Nevertheless, I don't think this is necessarily a reason for investors to hit the panic button just yet.\nWhile estimates vary, public research suggests that Nvidia owns at least 80% of the AI chip market. So, while a delay to the Blackwell launch may be a lowlight, it's extraordinarily unlikely that Nvidia will lose significant market share as a result of this design blunder.\nChief Investment Officer of Harvest Portfolio Management Paul Meeks recently expressed a similar sentiment during an interview on CNBC. He makes a great point in that demand for Nvidia's GPUs is so high that the company will have no real problem selling the Blackwell chips once they actually come to market -- regardless of the delay.\nAdditionally, each of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies has reported earnings this season except Nvidia. One of the common threads stitching mega-caps together is that spending on AI-powered products and services has steadily risen over the last year. In particular, capital expenditures (capex) have been on the rise among mega-cap tech as demand for cloud computing infrastructure, data center services, and semiconductor chips increases.\nConsidering that the bulk of Nvidia's revenue growth currently stems from hardware operations in chips and data centers, I think the rising investment in capex among big tech companies represents a compelling secular narrative around Nvidia's bright future.\nWhen investors are hit with some distressing news, it's always important to zoom out and consider all the variables.\nBack in 1997, Apple nearly filed for bankruptcy. Today, Apple is the largest company in the world by market cap. Even the best companies hit road bumps from time to time. What's more important is how management navigates these challenges in the moment.\nThe chart below illustrates Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) multiple over the last month. While a 14% drop in Nvidia stock may not seem like a lot in the grand scheme of things, the compression this decline has made on valuation multiples in such a short timeframe shouldn't be overlooked.\nOutside of its GPUs, the company is quietly building a software platform to complement the core chip business. Additionally, the company has made a number of strategic investments in areas such as robotics to further diversify its AI ecosystem.\nI don't see any of these initiatives as priced into Nvidia stock at the moment. In fact, I think much of what Nvidia is doing outside of GPUs is not yet fully understood. For these reasons, I think the reaction to the Blackwell delay is overblown and view the recent sell-off as a no-brainer opportunity to buy Nvidia stock right now as further gains look to be in store over the long run.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Powered by Nvidia and AI, humanoid ambitions take shape",
        "Author": " Akiko Fujita    \u00b7 Host",
        "Text": "When the Department of Defense commenced its robotics challenge in 2015, the stated goal was to develop ground robots that can aid in disaster recovery with the help of human operators. Each android was given an hour to complete eight tasks, which included driving a car and climbing some stairs.\nNearly a decade later, generative AI is accelerating that learning curve, pushing human-like machines to pick up new tasks in real time.\n\u201cThe holy grail for us is what we call zero-shot learning, or the ability to show the robot what to do, and it can do it the same way that you do that task,\u201d said Jeff Cardenas, co-founder of Apptronik, an Austin-based robotics maker.\nThat vision is slowly becoming reality. Last week, OpenAI-backed Figure unveiled the latest iteration of its humanoid robot. The robot is equipped with a vision language model that allows the machine to reason visually and self-correct learned behavior, according to the company\u2019s claims.\nAnd in June, Tesla (TSLA) presented an updated version of its Optimus robot at Tesla\u2019s Investor Day and showed it roaming a factory floor. CEO Elon Musk touted the robot\u2019s potential, saying it had the ability to push the company\u2019s market cap to $25 trillion.\nRobotics have been integrated into factory floors and warehouses to improve efficiencies for years. But current machines in use have largely been limited to moving from point A to point B and tackling a handful of tasks.\nHumanoids that can adapt to existing environments have long been seen as the ultimate test if they can work alongside humans in spaces built for them.\n\u201cIf you want a versatile robot, then having a robot that can retrofit into our environment so you don\u2019t have to change anything seems important,\u201d said Cardenas. \u201cToday, three to six [times] the price of the robot is spent just integrating that robot into a new workflow.\u201d\nNvidia (NVDA) is driving rapid development through an ecosystem built specifically for humanoids. It combines high-powered GPUs that process data at high speeds with Nvidia Omniverse, a digital world that allows users to train robots on skills applied in the real world.\nThe company announced the development of physical AI foundation models earlier this year. Just last month, Nvidia unveiled \u201cNIM Microservices,\u201d software technology that offers generative AI models for different applications, with some models that are able to visually interpret their surroundings in 3D.\n\u201cBefore, when we used to do an AI model for doing a particular task, we had to train it with specific data for that task \u2026 and if you needed that AI model to do something different, you needed to retrain that model,\u201d said Deepu Talla, Nvidia's vice president of Robotics and Edge Computing.\nNvidia\u2019s ecosystem now enables robots to train using text and speech input, in addition to live demonstrations.\nThose advancements have helped supercharge development at Apptronik, one of a handful of robotics companies Nvidia has partnered with. The company recently achieved a big milestone at its Austin headquarters when its humanoid robot, Apollo, autonomously performed tasks trained through visual learning. The machine was seen picking up a pair of socks and a hat and packing it into a box. A task that once took thousands of hours to train on took just 10 hours, according to the company.\n\u201cIf we build big data sets of humans doing tasks in these environments and we have robots with the same morphology as a person, then that allows us to have robots that can do a whole wide range of tasks over time,\u201d said Cardenas.\nThat potential has attracted record funding from investors. Humanoid robotics companies raised nearly $793 million in the first half of 2024, according to data from CB Insights.\nGoldman Sachs projects the humanoid market will reach $38 billion by 2035.\n\u201cIf you have a robot that can really do anything a human can, then that fundamentally changes the economy as we know it, right?\u201d said Sam Korus, director of Research, Autonomous Technology, and Robotics at Ark Invest. \u201cThen there\u2019s no more constraint on human labor.\u201d\nTech leaders have been quick to caution that more humanoids won\u2019t necessarily mean fewer human jobs. However, a report by Goldman Sachs estimates the machines are likely to substitute people in 5% to 15% of existing jobs in car manufacturing as well as in dangerous jobs, such as disaster rescue and nuclear reactor work. That demand is likely to push 1.1 million to 3.5 million units globally, according to the report.\nHumanoids have already begun taking their first steps into reality. Musk has said two Optimus robots are working at Tesla\u2019s Fremont factory, and he expects a few thousand to be deployed by next year. Amazon (AMZN) has partnered with Oregon-based Agility to utilize its Digit robot at a test facility. Apptronik is working with Mercedes-Benz to integrate Apollo into its manufacturing line.\nTalla sees a humanoid future beyond industrial use. He expects humanoids to become as ubiquitous as smartphones and EVs if companies are able to scale and bring costs down to $10,000 per machine.\n\u201cIt needs to be economical, it needs to be intelligent, and it needs to be safe,\u201d he said. \u201cIf those three conditions are met, then there\u2019s no reason why every home should not have at least one humanoid or more.\u201d\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

The company had $7.5 billion remaining on its existing authorization at the end of the quarter.\nNvidia's gaming division, which used to stand as the company's breadwinner, saw revenue of $2.8 billion, up 16% year over year.\nNvidia is the world leader in AI chip design and software, controlling between 80% and 95% of the market, according to Reuters.\nThe company has also been key to the current AI trade on Wall Street, with almost half of its revenue tied directly to tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta.\nNvidia\u2019s rivals aren\u2019t resting on their laurels. Earlier this month, AMD announced it is acquiring ZT Systems in a deal valued at $4.9 billion. The move gives AMD more firepower to build out AI system servers, something that\u2019s been a major catalyst for Nvidia\u2019s own sales.\nAnd while it could provide AMD with a boost in sales, it doesn\u2019t mean Nvidia will face any major threats to its reign as the AI king anytime soon.\n\"There are emerging competitors like AMD that are starting to take a little bit of market share,\" Stifel managing director Ruben Roy told Yahoo Finance Monday. \"But when you look at the overall infrastructure spend cycle \u2026 which we think is going to continue to increase, Nvidia appears to us as the best positioned to benefit from [spending].\"\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Despite some volatility in the stock market so far in August, Nvidia stock (NVDA) remains up over 150% this year.\nOver the last six months, the chipmaker's stock price has risen over 60% versus rivals, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), which has seen its share price fall more than 14% during the same time period.\nDriving the stock is Nvidia's role in supplying chips to major tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) that are crucial for artificial intelligence technology amid the broader generative AI boom.\nOver a third of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) market cap gains in the first half of 2024 could be attributed to Nvidia. For some investors, the concentration of gains in a few stocks, such as Nvidia, seems risky. It was a point that was underlined earlier this month by a stock rout that briefly pushed the volatility index (^VIX) above 60 and shares of Nvidia down by as much as 10%.\nStocks ended up recovering, but the period offered a reminder to investors that they could seek AI opportunities elsewhere.\nFor those looking to gain an edge and diversify their tech holdings, understanding AI's core technology and terminology is essential.\nHere's a breakdown of a few of the terms to know when investing in the AI boom:\nInference\nInference is AI\u2019s moment of truth. It's when an AI model like ChatGPT generates an answer to a prompt based on its previous training and learning. The quality of an AI system's inference relies heavily on its underlying technology stack, including the powerful chips that drive it.\nCompute\nCompute power is the driving force behind an AI system's success, similar to how horsepower propels a car. The greater the compute power, the more efficient and faster the inference process becomes.\nProcessing power, memory, and storage all fuel compute power, and chipmakers tend to focus on increased compute power for new chip releases because improvements in compute power with each chip generation could allow companies to charge more, which typically bodes well for future profit margins.\nGPUs\nGraphics processing units, or GPUs, are advanced and expensive chips that power AI. Their quality can help determine the speed of AI computations. Nvidia, which began working on GPUs in the '90s, owns over 80% of the GPU market and mentioned the term 19 times in its first quarter earnings presentation. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs have increased AI inference performance by a thousand times over the last decade.\nHyperscalers\nBig Tech companies like Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon are considered hyperscalers, or those capable of rapidly scaling AI. With products and services such as Microsoft's Copilot, Alphabet's Gemini, and Meta's Llama, these companies are significant both as consumers of AI chips and competitors to chipmakers.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is falling Thursday following the release of the company's second-quarter earnings results. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price was down 3.2% as of 10:15 a.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nNvidia published Q2 results after the market closed yesterday and delivered results that were significantly better than most targets on Wall Street. The company also issued guidance for the third quarter that beat the average analyst estimate. But expectations were sky-high heading into the report, and comments from the investor conference call suggested that investors may have to wait longer for the semiconductor specialist's next-generation Blackwell processors.\nNvidia recorded non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings of $0.68 per share on revenue of $30 billion in the second quarter of its current fiscal year, which ended July 28. Meanwhile, the average analyst estimate had called for the business to post adjusted earnings of $0.64 on revenue of $28.7 billion. The company's sales were up 122% year over year in the period, and adjusted earnings per share were up 152% compared to the prior-year period.\nIt was a fantastic quarter for the business, with AI-related demand spurring another round of big growth from data center customers. Segment revenue surged 154% higher year over year, and high selling prices for graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerators in the category helped the business post an adjusted gross margin of 75.7%. That was down a bit from the 78.9% margin it posted in fiscal Q1, but it still beat the company's 75.5% target margin and signaled that Nvidia's pricing power on its most advanced hardware remains very strong.\nFor the third quarter, Nvidia guided for revenue of $32.5 billion -- a target that came in ahead of the average Wall Street estimate's call for sales of $31.7 billion in the period. The company also guided for an adjusted gross margin of 75%. While this suggests that gross margin will decline on a sequential quarterly basis, the drop-off here looks very small and should actually be easing pricing-power concerns.\nBut despite strong second-quarter results and guidance for Q3, investors are focusing on some uncertainty surrounding the launch of Nvidia's Blackwell processors. The company said that the production of its next-generation chip platform will ramp up in this year's fourth quarter, which suggests that the new processors may miss their initially announced 2024 release window and slip into 2025.\nThe possibility of Blackwell being delayed due to a design flaw had already been widely reported prior to Nvidia's earnings report, so the potential for the release being pushed into next year isn't shocking. But expectations were so high heading into the report that investors seem to be focusing on the implication of a relatively short delay over signs that the business is otherwise firing on all cylinders.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Though, as Julie Hyman wrote Thursday, it\u2019s a little more complicated than that, since they must go all in to even get a seat at the table.\nBut the nature of supply chain dynamics means that what gathers and melts in the mountains pours into the rivers and lakes.\nAnd as our Chart of the Week shows, Big Tech is still making it rain. And Nvidia is the lake.\nAccording to estimates from Bloomberg, coupled with quarterly reports, more than 40% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue comes from some familiar names among the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks \u2014 Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.\nThe biggest transfer is from Microsoft, with spending from the world\u2019s most valuable company accounting for 19% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue. This makes the company its biggest customer by far, nearly doubling Meta\u2019s spend and tripling that of Alphabet and Amazon.\nAnd on the Microsoft side, Bloomberg\u2019s data shows Nvidia accounts for 45% of its capital expenditures, whereas the chipmaker only gets 15% of Alphabet\u2019s outlays, for example.\nIn the AI jungle, this data is a reminder that the chipmakers eat first, long before the hyperscalers can offer much more than hints to investors about when the AI investments will turn into AI revenue streams.\nStill, this is one of the key charts that have helped power the market, especially through the tech earnings season.\nFor now, the lack of revenue isn\u2019t too worrying to investors \u2014 though doubts are rising! \u2014 as it\u2019s still hard to imagine the trillion-dollar Microsoft doesn\u2019t know something they don\u2019t about the opportunity.\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "Title": "Amazon Sent a Big Warning to Nvidia Shareholders. Is the AI Stock in Trouble?",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have surged 145% over the past year due to the semiconductor company's critical position in the artificial intelligence (AI) economy. Specifically, Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUS) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like training machine learning models and running artificial intelligence applications.\nEarlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported, \"Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%.\" Some analysts believe Nvidia controls as much as 95% of the AI chip market. But Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) recently issued a warning for Nvidia shareholders.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told analysts no single artificial intelligence chip will fit every use case, simply because companies and developers want optionality. \"You saw this several years ago when some companies tried to argue that TensorFlow will be the only machine learning framework that mattered, and then PyTorch and others overtook it,\" Jassy explained.\nNvidia consistently sets performance records at the MLPerf benchmarks, objective tests that measure how well AI systems perform training and inference tasks. But Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are also very expensive. Its H200 GPUs cost up to $40,000 each, and full server racks cost millions of dollars. Jassy believes there is robust demand for products between the two extremes, so Amazon is developing custom AI silicon.\n\"We have a deep partnership with Nvidia and the broadest selection of Nvidia instances available, but we've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance,\" Jassy told analysts. \"It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon. Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference.\"\nImportantly, Amazon has previous experience in developing custom chips. The company has been designing generalized central processing units (CPUs) called Graviton processors for several years. Those chips are based on Arm architecture, and they offer 30% to 40% better price performance versus the leading x86 processors from AMD and Intel, according to Jassy.\nAmazon has the same goal with its custom AI silicon. Trainium and Inferentia are not meant to challenge Nvidia GPUs on performance alone, but rather to provide customers with a cost-efficient alternative. Some companies would rather pay a premium for the fastest AI chips, but others would gladly use slower chips to save money.\nAmazon is not the only company that is designing custom silicon. Broadcom develops custom AI chips for Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms, and it won a third major customer earlier this year. The company has not named the customer, but Reuters identified it as TikTok parent ByteDance. Additionally, J.P. Morgan\u00a0analysts recently speculated that Broadcom has also secured a contract to build custom AI chips for OpenAI, bringing its total to four major customers.\nJoseph Moore at Morgan Stanley expects that trend to continue. \"Hyperscalers, including Amazon, Google, and Meta, use custom silicon for their data centers due to cost and energy constraints in AI computing. As hyperscalers continue to invest in AI infrastructure, we expect increased demand for energy-efficient and cost optimizing custom chips to outpace the growth of general-purpose GPUs,\" he wrote in a note to clients.\nHere's the big picture: While Nvidia dominates the AI processor market today, input from Amazon and Morgan Stanley indicates the company is virtually guaranteed to lose market share in the years ahead. That does not mean Nvidia will lose its leadership position in the AI chip market. I doubt that will happen. But some spending will inevitably be redirected away from expensive Nvidia GPUs as more cost-efficient alternatives are made available.\nAdditionally, Nvidia will probably lose some pricing power as it fights to maintain its market share. Indeed, the company's gross margin declined 330 basis points sequentially in the most recent quarter, despite reporting 122% revenue growth on strong demand for its AI chips. Investors should expect that trend to continue in the coming quarters.\nHowever, Nvidia is not necessarily a bad investment. In fact, Wall Street still expects its earnings to increase at 37% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 56 times earnings look reasonable. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.5, which is well below the three-year average of 3.1.\nPersonally, I think investors looking to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom should have a position in Nvidia, and I am not alone. A recent note from Jim Kelleher at Argus reads, \"We believe that most technology investors should own [Nvidia] in the age of deep learning, AI, and GPU-driven application acceleration.\"\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a scorching-hot buy over the past couple of years, largely due to the key role it plays in artificial intelligence (AI). The company's AI chips are crucial for companies that are developing AI models. And Nvidia has a commanding 80% market share when it comes to AI chips. That's part of the reason why investors have remained bullish on the stock -- it's arguably the best-positioned stock to benefit from growing demand for AI.\nBut given how lucrative the opportunities are in AI, it's only a matter of time before more competitors emerge and fight for market share. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has recently turned to one of those unexpected competitors to source chips for its new AI-powered iPhones.\nOne of the companies that has been developing its own chips is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). And Apple has been training its new AI system, called \"Apple Intelligence,\" using Alphabet's custom chips, according to a research paper. The company used two versions of Google's tensor processing unit to develop its AI models, which gives iPhone users access to generative AI features, including advanced writing tools, the ability to generate images, and a Siri assistant with \"all-new superpowers.\"\nAlphabet is a potentially strong competitor for Nvidia to worry about. The company has plenty of resources to work with. Last year, Alphabet generated more than $69 billion in free cash flow. It has been investing in its AI chatbot Gemini, and AI chips could provide it with yet another growth opportunity to pile money into.\nThe courts recently found that the company's search engine, Google, has an illegal monopoly. And depending on what the consequences of that finding are, Alphabet may soon see a huge incentive to find a new growth opportunity to pursue, as the ruling may have a detrimental effect on a key part of its business.\nBeyond Alphabet, however, there are other competitors for Nvidia to worry about. Meta Platforms has been working on an AI chip of its own, as has Amazon. And investors also shouldn't forget about AMD, which is a more traditional rival for Nvidia. Although it has been late to the game, AMD has made it clear that AI is a big priority for the business, and it could also take away some sizable market share from Nvidia in the future.\nNvidia has generated incredible gains due to its dominance in the AI chip space. And it is working on innovating and coming out with more advanced chips to ensure it remains on top. But maintaining such a large market share can be incredibly difficult, especially with so many big tech companies out there with deep pockets to contend with. They aren't simply going to ignore such a massive opportunity in AI chips.\nThe company's revenue has taken off over the past year, with Nvidia's growth rate in recent quarters being well in excess of 200%. Those kinds of numbers, while extremely impressive, are also extremely difficult to maintain. At some point, Nvidia's growth rate will start to come down, especially if more competition emerges in the field. And its high-priced chips may also need to come down in price if that's the case, which may lead to both a slowing growth rate and smaller profit margins than the 50%-plus margins it has been averaging of late.\nNvidia's stock has been giving back some gains in recent weeks, but it's still a top company to invest in if you want exposure to the red-hot AI market. While other companies may try to take market share from Nvidia, that doesn't mean that they will be able to do so overnight.\nNvidia is still in an excellent position to continue growing, but I would expect its growth rate and margins to come down a bit in future quarters, especially as companies potentially reduce AI spending due to a possible economic slowdown. Nvidia's stock may struggle in the near term, but as long you're willing to hang on for the long term, it can still make for a good buy. Still, you should brace for some challenges ahead.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price climbed 4.1% in the daily session, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nNvidia stock got a boost in today's trading as investors and analysts reassessed the impact of a potential delay for the first generation of the company's upcoming Blackwell processors. The company's share price likely also got a boost from news that the graphics processing unit (GPU) frontrunner had signed a new AI training deal with the state of California.\nNvidia has been touting the importance of developing AI systems for countries. The company anticipates a dramatic ramping of public sector spending to develop artificial intelligence systems as countries aim to shore up national defense capabilities and overall sovereignty. The announcement of the new training partnership with California reflects a similar dynamic on a U.S.-state level. It wouldn't be surprising to see Nvidia announce additional AI training deals with other states in the near future.\nUBS published a report on Nvidia today, maintaining a buy rating on the stock and a one-year price target of $150 per share. The artificial intelligence leader's stock has seen volatile trading recently as investors have weighed concerns about expectations that its first Blackwell processors will be delayed. With the company closing out today's daily session valued at roughly $109 per share, UBS' price target suggests near-term upside of roughly 38%.\nThe first releases in the Blackwell line are expected to deliver a substantial leap forward in processing power and were expected to be a major performance driver for Nvidia this year. In general, the market has also shown some skittishness lately when it comes to valuations for megacap companies and leading AI players. But the bank thinks the tech stock is undervalued at current prices.\nUBS expects that a potential delay for the first Blackwell processors would still have them releasing by the end of January 2025, and the bank's analysts on the stock think overall demand for Nvidia's processors will remain very strong.

        "Title": "Apple Says No to Nvidia GPUs. Is This the End for Nvidia?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best stocks to invest in since the start of 2023. Its climb centers around the massive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing power. A lot of this demand comes from big tech players, but one big tech company recently said no to Nvidia.\nAlthough Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was late to the artificial intelligence game, its product was highly anticipated. To many people's surprise, Apple didn't use Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units) to create its AI model. Could this be a sign that Nvidia's GPU empire is starting to crack?\nNvidia's GPUs have become incredibly popular for running AI workloads. Nvidia's GPUs are best in class, and it has industry-leading software available to help squeeze out every bit of performance from the GPUs. This is important as these servers that run AI models contain thousands of GPUs. GPUs are a top choice for this kind of workload because they can perform many calculations in parallel, unlike central processing units (CPUs) found in PCs. They are also good at other tasks, like cryptocurrency mining, engineering simulations, and drug discovery.\nBut because they aren't purpose-built for AI calculations, there is likely a better way to process calculations. These chips exist and aren't made by any of Nvidia's traditional competitors.\nOne of these alternatives is Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) tensor processing unit (TPU). Alphabet's TPU was designed specifically for these large AI computations but is limited in flexibility. If a workload is properly set up, TPUs blow Nvidia's GPUs' performance out of the water, but only for specific use cases.\nThis is the primary reason Apple selected Alphabet's TPUs to train its Apple Intelligence model. Does one of the largest players in the industry selecting purpose-built hardware rather than a broader one signify the end for Nvidia?\nPart of the reason some investors (like myself) are hesitant to buy into Nvidia's stock now is the extreme growth expectations built into the company. Anyone buying the stock now assumes that the demand for Nvidia's GPUs will continue to grow significantly. However, they don't consider the possibility that once developers are used to setting up their AI models in a particular way, they may choose to use purpose-built hardware like the TPU.\nThis could be a thesis-breaker for Nvidia, as Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to grow by 98% this year to $110 billion and by 36% next year to $151 billion. Should demand for its product drop, these projections could be in danger.\nIt's not just Alphabet with its custom design, either. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) both have their own custom chips that are purpose-built for AI model training. Neither of these three companies sells these products directly to the consumer. Instead, if clients want to access them, they must rent them through one of their cloud computing offerings.\nThis is a better long-term business model than Nvidia's, as once Nvidia sells its GPU, the only revenue it will get is from customers deciding to upgrade or replace the unit after its service life is complete. Cloud computing companies buy hardware and then rent the power to clients on a recurring basis, extending the value they can get from one unit.\nStill, all three cloud giants' data centers are filled to the brim with Nvidia's GPUs, and they're all buying more. So, while there may be better ways to train AI models, many companies are still training on GPUs.\nTime will tell whether this trend reverses and more companies train AI models like Apple did or GPUs for broader use continue to dominate.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Wall Street anticipates another strong quarter for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as investors\u2019 favorite chipmaker prepares to release its fiscal Q2 2025 results on August 28. The company\u2019s high-end graphics processing chips, which are the benchmark for running generative AI workloads, continue to see robust demand, setting the stage for a solid performance.\nAlthough there have been reports of a delay in the Blackwell chip, which could cause some near-term volatility in Nvidia\u2019s fundamentals, Nvidia\u2019s management commentary and supply-chain data in the coming weeks may reinforce confidence in the company\u2019s earnings potential for calendar year 2025, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.\nThey believe that the market is likely to overlook any negative impacts from a shift in the Blackwell ramp's timing, projecting robust sequential growth in Nvidia\u2019s Data Center revenue. This growth is expected to be driven by strong demand for Hopper-based GPUs, early shipments of Blackwell products, and expansion in Nvidia\u2019s Networking business, even if there are transitory headwinds related to Blackwell.\nThe analysts also note that customer demand remains strong among large cloud service providers and enterprises, with Nvidia maintaining a solid competitive position in AI and accelerated computing.\nThey highlight several supportive indicators, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (NYSE:TSM) improved outlook for AI demand, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD)'s increase in its full-year Data Center GPU revenue outlook, and positive comments from major U.S. hyperscalers about their plans to expand AI infrastructure investments.\nMoreover, Taiwanese original design manufacturers (ODMs) and companies like Hon Hai have reported better-than-expected revenues, reinforcing the view that demand for AI servers is strong. AI server maker Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) also exceeded expectations with its recent earnings and provided strong guidance, driven by demand for its Direct Liquid Cooling solutions from AI-focused cloud service providers.\nThe analysts further mention that U.S.-based hyperscalers, which account for more than 50% of Nvidia\u2019s Data Center revenue, have continued to express optimism about Nvidia's future.\nSome customers have offered early evidence of how generative AI is already benefiting industries like advertising, indicating a preference to \"over-invest in the near-term and secure a leadership position than under-invest only to miss what is shaping up to be a significant revenue/growth opportunity,\u201d Goldman analysts said.\nFrom a stock perspective, analysts view the setup for Nvidia as \u201cconstructive.\u201d\nThe stock is currently trading at 42x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS, with a relative premium of just 46%\u2014a significant discount compared to its past three-year median of 151%.\n\u201cIn short, we believe risk/reward on the stock is favorable with our most bullish scenario pointing to 89% potential upside vs. 61% potential downside under our most bearish scenario.\u201d\nThe analysts reiterate their Buy rating and maintain a price target of $135.\nRelated Articles\nNvidia earnings preview: Goldman reiterates Buy on solid AI infrastructure demand\nTrend-following hedge funds returning to Japanese equities, J.P.Morgan says\nMajor markets mixed on US rate-cut hopes, weak oil demand\n"

        "Author": "  Kayode Omotosho ",
        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 14.8% in the pre-market session after markets continued to decline, although they have recovered a bit since the open (Nasdaq down 3.6%, S&P 500 down 3%). Yields also retreated as worries about a US recession grew. The declines followed volatility on Friday, August 2, when the July Non-Farm Payrolls data revealed weaker job growth as the unemployment rate rose.\nMarkets might also be concerned that the Fed is behind in cutting rates, with the Federal Open Market Committee leaving rates steady at 5.25%-5.50% during the July 2024 meeting. For example, respected economist and University of Pennsylvania professor Jeremy Siegel took an aggressive stance, calling on the Fed to make an emergency 75 basis-point cut in the federal funds rate after Friday\u2019s disappointing jobs report.\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. However, the economy matters as well. Recessions can mean broad-based declines in demand for everything from consumer goods to enterprise software.\nWe at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 19 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Nvidia and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago, when the company gained 11.6% on the news that semiconductor stocks soared after Reuters reported that the Biden administration plans to introduce softer trading restrictions related to US companies' export of semiconductors. According to sources, \"shipments from allies that export key chipmaking equipment\u2014including Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea\u2014will be excluded, limiting the impact of the rule.\"\nNvidia is up 112% since the beginning of the year, but at $102.02 per share it is still trading 24.8% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $27,092.\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

But those models weren't trained using Nvidia GPUs. They weren't trained using GPUs at all.\nApple used Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to train its Apple Foundation Models, which power Apple Intelligence.

Nvidia sank 7% after saying third-quarter revenue will be about $32.5 billion. While analysts had predicted $31.9 billion on average, estimates ranged as high as $37.9 billion. The company also signaled that it was working through production snags with its highly anticipated new Blackwell chip.\n\u201cHere\u2019s the issue: the size of the beat this time was much smaller than we\u2019ve been seeing,\u201d said Ryan Detrick at Carson Group. \u201cEven future guidance was raised, but again not by the tune from previous quarters. This is a great company that is still growing revenue at 122%, but it appears the bar was just set a tad too high.\u201d\nOn the flip side, Nvidia\u2019s revenue more than doubled to $30 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which ended July 28.

The S&P 500 \u2014 at one point \u2014 headed toward its worst drop since the Aug. 5 meltdown. The gauge pushed away from that threshold, closing down 0.6%. The Nasdaq 100 slid 1.2%.

        "Title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 1 Year?",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the top stocks on the market in the past year, delivering outstanding gains of 142% to investors as of this writing, but a closer look at this semiconductor giant's recent stock price action suggests that its stunning rally may have finally come to a halt.\nShares of Nvidia hit a 52-week high on June 20. However, the stock has pulled back by\u00a0 22% since then. Concerns have been raised about Nvidia's expensive valuation and its ability to sustain its eye-popping growth beyond next year. Additionally, it looks like not all tech giants have been looking to get their hands on Nvidia's chips to train artificial intelligence (AI) models.\nApple, for instance, recently revealed that it used tensor processing units (TPUs) from Alphabet's Google division to train the large language model (LLM) powering its Apple Intelligence suite of AI features. That could have been a significant Nvidia contract, but AMD won the deal. Developments like this one seem to have weighed down Nvidia's stock lately.\nBut is this significant pullback an opportunity for savvy investors to buy this hot AI stock in anticipation that it could regain its mojo and deliver healthy gains once again in the coming year? Let's find out.\nAnalysts estimate that Nvidia's share of the AI data center graphics processing unit (GPU) market stands between 70% and 95%. This puts the company in a robust position to capitalize on the healthy demand for AI accelerators, both in the short and the long run. For instance, recent results from Nvidia's peer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) indicate that the hot demand for AI chips isn't going away.\nAMD witnessed a terrific 115% year-over-year increase in its data center revenue to $2.8 billion in the second quarter of 2024. The company pointed out that this impressive increase was \"primarily driven by the steep ramp of AMD Instinct GPU shipments,\" which are AI accelerators deployed in data centers.\nIt is also worth noting that AMD sold just over $1 billion worth of its MI300 AI GPU in the previous quarter. AMD now expects to sell $4.5 billion worth of data center GPUs in 2024 as compared to the previous guidance of $4 billion. That's also a nice bump from the $3.5 billion data center GPU forecast AMD issued in January this year. This Nvidia rival is enjoying robust success right now.\nThat's not the end of Nvidia's growth, though. Nvidia is a much bigger player than AMD in the data center GPU market, and it is also growing at a much faster pace. Nvidia sold $22.6 billion worth of data center chips in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, with its revenue from this segment rising a whopping 427% year over year.\nThere are two reasons why Nvidia clocked such phenomenal data center growth. First, we have seen that the company commands a dominant position in this market. Second, the size of the AI chip market is growing at a solid annual rate of 68%, according to market research firm TechNavio. The firm estimates that the AI chip market could grow by $390 billion between 2023 and 2028, which is why it won't be surprising to see Nvidia's business continue growing at a healthy pace in the future.\nUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri estimates that Nvidia could generate $204 billion in revenue in calendar year 2025 (which will coincide with the majority of its fiscal year 2026). For comparison, Nvidia is expected to deliver $120 billion in revenue in the current fiscal year 2025. So, Arcuri's estimate points toward a jump of 70% in Nvidia's revenue in the next fiscal year.\nArcuri's estimate is based on the healthy demand for Nvidia's new Blackwell generation of AI chips. The analyst points out that data center operators are placing huge orders for liquid-cooled server racks to house Nvidia's Blackwell chips. As a result, Nvidia could ship 69,000 Blackwell-based systems next year, generating $9 billion in revenue for every 5,000 such systems that it ships.\nAdditionally, Nvidia could generate $4.95 per share in earnings in 2025. Again, that's well above the $3.74 per share consensus estimate for fiscal 2026 (which coincides with 11 months of the calendar year 2025). Assuming Nvidia's fiscal 2026 earnings end up at the consensus estimate of $3.74 per share, its stock price could increase to $161 next year based on its forward earnings multiple of 43 (which represents a discount to the U.S. technology sector's earnings multiple of 45).\nThat would be a 50% increase from current levels. However, if Nvidia's earnings get close to Arcuri's estimate, investors could expect more upside from this semiconductor stock. That's why savvy investors could consider using Nvidia's pullback to buy more shares as its recent weakness could be temporary thanks to the massive AI opportunity it is sitting on.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n View our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It's an outstanding feat for NVIDIA to have grown EPS from US$0.19 to US$1.73 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The music to the ears of NVIDIA shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 17% to 60% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. That's great to see, on both counts.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for NVIDIA.\nSince NVIDIA has a market capitalisation of US$3.1t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$123b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\nNVIDIA's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering NVIDIA for a spot on your watchlist. We should say that we've discovered 1 warning sign for NVIDIA that you should be aware of before investing here.\nAlthough NVIDIA certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with more skin in the game, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have strong insider backing.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

Nvidia's success in desktop GPUs has given it the brand power and financial resources to expand to multiple other sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, healthcare, government, robotics, and self-driving vehicles.\nNvidia's stock has climbed about 140% in the last 12 months but appears to only just be getting started. So, despite recent growth, Nvidia's stock remains a compelling option worth considering this year.\nNvidia temporarily achieved a market cap above $3 trillion earlier this year, joining Microsoft and Apple in the elite club of trillion-dollar companies. However, its market cap is currently around $2.7 billion after a slight correction and pullback from tech industry investors. Yet, Nvidia's significant growth potential suggests it won't be long before it rises above that $3 trillion milestone again -- and this time, for good.\nAI has highlighted the crucial role chips have to play in the future of tech, equipping developers with the power necessary to build the generative software. Meanwhile, AI is only one of many industries that require high-powered chips to move forward, representing many growth catalysts for Nvidia.\nData from JPMorgan Chase shows that prominent tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms will reach capital expenditures totaling $201 billion by May 2025. That figure will be up from about $140 billion in 2023, representing a 44% rise. Much of that will be spent on expanding their positions in AI, building data centers, and equipping them with GPUs.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia is well-positioned to enjoy massive gains from increased AI spending, with its GPUs responsible for about 90% of the market. The company posted revenue gains of 262% year over year in Q1 2025, up 18% sequentially. The increase was mainly thanks to a 427% increase in its data center segment, illustrating a rise in AI chip sales.\nNvidia has enjoyed stellar growth from AI, even while many markets have barely scratched the surface of what's possible with the technology. Large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT have proven the utility of language generation. However, as Meta Chief Scientist Yann LeCun recently pointed out, these platforms \"don't really understand the physical world. They don't really have persistent memory. They can't really reason, and they certainly can't plan.\"\nThe best and most efficient use of AI has likely not even been thought of yet, with decades of understanding likely ahead. And Nvidia is well-equipped to continue fueling the market's development. Increased spending in AI will likely continue to boost earnings and raise its market cap to well above $3 trillion.\nNvidia's stock recently was trading at about 65 times its earnings. That figure beats its biggest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, which has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of an eye-watering 206. The data shows that Nvidia is a better value than its competitor, but not exactly a huge bargain.\nHowever, this chart shows that Nvidia's current P/E is below its five-year average for the metric, during which the company's stock price skyrocketed by 2,450%. As a result, a high P/E doesn't necessarily mean the company's stock will fall short in growth.\nIn addition to Nvidia's monster potential in AI and tech in general, its stock is too good to ignore for anyone looking for a long-term investment. The company will likely continue profiting from rising chip demand for years as more and more markets require powerful hardware to develop.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "I'm a longtime Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) bull. But even I'm concerned about what's happening with Nvidia stock right now.\nConsider this: Nvidia's stock has experienced its first 20% drawdown since the start of 2023.\nIn other words, the market finally found a gap in Nvidia's armor. Sure, Nvidia has already bounced off its lows and could recover and make new highs, but is it time to worry that Nvidia's flawless longer-term bull run is coming to an end? Let's dive in and see.\nSince reaching an all-time high of $140.76 in June, Nvidia shares fell by 27%. That may not seem like all that much. Yet, bear in mind, at its peak, Nvidia boasted a market cap of more than $3.2 trillion -- making it briefly the world's largest public company.\nDuring its drawdown, it shed more than $650 billion in value -- roughly equivalent to the total market cap of Tesla, America's 10th-largest company.\nIn other words, Nvidia's recent sell-off is a big deal. And not just because of the value it has lost -- after all, that could be recovered in a similarly short amount of time. No, the bigger concerns are why Nvidia dropped so steeply and whether it could have been the result of fundamental weakness for the company and its stock.\nLet's see what the numbers say.\nIt's true: Nvidia's stock has skyrocketed over the last few years. So, let's boil down what's behind that success. In my opinion, it comes down to two key factors: \nRising sales\nRising expectations of future sales\nTo put it another way, Nvidia's stock has skyrocketed because its revenue is way up, and expectations of its future revenue keep increasing, too. So, can that continue?\nIf you look at Nvidia's revenue over the past two years, it's easy to see why its stock has exploded higher. The company has roughly tripled its revenue from $25 billion/year to over $75 billion/year on the back of massive graphics processing unit (GPU) sales -- the \"brains\" behind artificial intelligence (AI).\nBut that's not the only reason for the stock's success. Along with this massive revenue growth, investors have been willing to pay far more for each dollar in revenue based on increased expectations of future revenue growth. That's why Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio has also risen. In 2022, it bottomed under 10 times. However, just a few weeks ago, Nvidia's P/S ratio was an astonishing 42 times.\nThe only way to explain this change is that investors expect Nvidia's sales to grow -- rapidly. Indeed, analysts expect Nvidia to double its sales to nearly $120 billion this year. However, this is where concerns begin to bubble up.\nWhat if those same analysts temper their expectations for Nvidia's revenue growth or, even worse, begin to lower those sales estimates? That would call into question the massive valuation premium investors have been paying (as represented by Nvidia's P/S ratio) and, in turn, result in another significant sell-off in the stock.\nFor some answers about whether this is possible, let's examine this chart, which shows how Wall Street analysts have adjusted their revenue estimates over the last three years.\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for 2 Quarters Ahead, 30 Day % Change data by YCharts\nThis chart shows how much analysts have adjusted their estimates of Nvidia's future revenue (two quarters away) over the last 30 days. Peaks represent large increases (good for the stock); valleys represent decreases (bad for the stock). \nAs you can see, there have been far more peaks than valleys over the last two years. However, those peaks have been decreasing in size. That means that with each quarterly report, analysts have been closer to matching Nvidia's sales guidance. In other words, Wall Street's expectations are starting to catch up to reality. If that trend holds, those factors should reach equilibrium, then perhaps reverse -- company guidance may fall below expectations, and analysts will have to cut their revenue forecasts, resulting in valleys on this chart and a falling share price for Nvidia.\nTo sum it up, Nvidia's stock has been on a rocket ride for almost two years. Similarly, its sales and sales expectations have taken off, too. Yet, those high expectations have also driven up its stock valuation. In turn, the stock is highly vulnerable to a sharp downturn. Investors should be cautious with Nvidia stock. Even though the company remains well positioned for the long term, volatility in the short term means the stock is not a good match for some investment portfolios right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) earnings have already been climbing in the triple digits -- and that's led to mind-boggling stock performance. Shares of the technology giant have soared 2,500% over the past five years. And even though stock performance has slowed in recent weeks, the shares have still advanced about 120% since the start of this year.\nThe reason for this growth is simple: Nvidia has secured itself a major position in one of today's hottest growth markets: artificial intelligence (AI). The company holds 80% of the AI chip market thanks to the tremendous performance of its graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips power key AI tasks, such as the training and inference of large language models (LLMs).\nNow, as other chip companies launch products to rival Nvidia's top chip, some investors wonder whether Nvidia's biggest wave of growth is over. But my prediction is that one thing in particular will be Nvidia's biggest growth driver yet -- and it's right around the corner. Let's find out more.\nFirst, a quick note on Nvidia's path to this point. Several years ago, the company was a giant in the video games market, with its GPUs bringing games to life on the screen for players. It became clear, though, that Nvidia's GPUs could be valuable across industries for many uses -- particularly AI. The tech company decided to focus on this high-growth industry, designing GPUs for those building AI platforms.\nAnd Nvidia didn't stop at GPUs. The company has designed a whole ecosystem of products and services for AI, making it the go-to provider for top chips and more. Market giants, such as Meta Platforms and Tesla, are major customers. In Tesla's recent earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said,\u00a0\"I'm incredibly impressed by Nvidia's execution and the capability of their hardware. And what we are seeing is that the demand for Nvidia hardware is so high that it's often difficult to get the GPUs.\"\nSo, it's clear that Nvidia's growth is far from over. But can it actually get even stronger? I think so, and what could spur this next era of even more growth is the company's upcoming release of the Blackwell architecture and chip.\nThe Blackwell architecture includes six transformative technologies, from being the most powerful chip yet to features offering higher security, reliability, and top performance in data analytics. In Nvidia's first-quarter earnings report, the company said Blackwell was in full production -- and the goal was to make it globally available later this year. At that point, similar to Elon Musk's recent words about Nvidia GPUs, the company said demand was surpassing supply. Nvidia expects this trend to continue next year, too.\nThough Nvidia is constantly working to deliver its GPUs to those who need them, CEO Jensen Huang has emphasized the difficulty of addressing such a high need.\nAll of this suggests Nvidia's growth is far from over. And that Blackwell offers such improvements in performance -- for example, allowing companies to run generative AI on LLMs at as much as 25 times less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor -- signals growth could be set to take off. Nvidia's Huang says the company expects to see \"a lot\" of revenue from Blackwell this year.\nSo, what does this mean for investors? Nvidia shares aren't cheap, trading at 39 times forward earnings estimates, but considering Nvidia's track record and the upcoming Blackwell launch, this valuation is reasonable. Even if Nvidia shares don't soar immediately, it's clear there's a lot of gas in this tank to power gains over the long term.\nI predict that Blackwell will be the key to Nvidia's next era of massive growth -- and it's worth sticking around or getting in on the stock's recent dip to potentially benefit from this exciting story.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Stocks That Will Change the World. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0stands against the other stocks.\nIf we were to try and summarize one of the biggest ways how to make money on the stock market, it\u2019d include buying stocks of firms that have changed the world. The biggest and\u00a0most valuable companies\u00a0of today didn\u2019t start that way, and those who had a chance to invest in them decades back are considerably well off and some are even among the richest people in the world.\nIn fact, the two biggest technologies that have changed the world since the 1970s are personal computing and the Internet. Within these, the former is older and started through the launch of products such as Windows and the Mac. The two companies that make these products are up by 405,920% and 166,238% on the stock market since their shares were listed. So, if you, or anyone you know, had bought $1,000 of shares back then, your investment would be worth $4 million or $1.7 million today.\nAlong with personal computing, the Internet is the second world changing technology that has not only reformed the way in which businesses operate and regular people live their lives but also left a slew of billionaires in its wake. Starting from the dotcom era of the 1990s, the few companies that did survive the \u2018pop\u2019 are among the largest and most valuable in the world today. These have managed to use the power of the Internet to change the way people shop and access information. The former, founded by Jeff Bezos, whose latest net worth is estimated to sit at $190 billion, is up 185,389% since its stock started trading.\nA $1,000 investment back then would be worth $1.9 million. Similarly, the world\u2019s largest search engine company and the\u00a0world\u2019s biggest social media firm, are up by 5,939% and 1,254% since their stock started trading in the 2000s. It\u2019s a testament to the power of world changing technologies to drive stock prices that these quad digit percentage returns appear to be \u2018meager\u2019 when compared to the six digit returns of the world changing stocks that have been trading since the 1970s and the 1990s.\nBut what about 2024? After all, while these disruptive stocks have made their mark on Wall Street history, it is highly unlikely that they will yield similar returns in the future. Well, one disruptive technology that has caught the world by storm is artificial intelligence. Spurred by the public launch of the chatbot ChatGPT, AI\u2019s proponents swear that it will transform the world just like the Internet did. This transformation is being spearheaded by big tech, as the\u00a0largest technology companies in the world\u00a0fork out billions of dollars in AI spending.\nData shows that during the first half of 2024, the four biggest AI players spent a whopping $106 billion in spending as part of a game theory-esque roulette that Mark Zuckerberg described as risking \u201cbuilding capacity before it is needed, rather than too late.\u201d As for the future, analysts expect that AI spending over the next five years could touch a\u00a0whopping\u00a0$1 trillion. This spending has also driven the shares of the world\u2019s pre eminent AI GPU maker (and the youngest game changing stock) to rise by 261,775% since they started trading.\nLooking at these gains makes it even more important that we try to wager a guess at what future industries can change the world. One way to somewhat simplify our research is to look at what investment newsletters are saying. The writers of these newsletters are often on the hunt for high growth sectors since correctly identifying them leads to a boost of credibility that drives subscriptions and eventually leads to revenue. On this front, we looked at some such industries as part of our coverage of\u00a010 Stocks That Will Skyrocket.\nWithin these industries, two that stand out are quantum computing and nuclear energy. For those out of the loop, quantum computing is an expansion of current computing as it significantly increases the data that a computer can compute. However, quantum computing stocks are laggards in the stock market. We covered top hedge fund quantum computing stock picks during our coverage of\u00a012 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In. Out of these 12 stocks, 10 either have quantum computing returns baked into their stock price or are too important in the industry to ignore. Analyzing their year to date performance reveals that out of these ten quantum computing stocks, four are in the green and this drops to three if we focus only on pureplay quantum computing stocks. These three stocks rank\u00a05th,\u00a07th,\u00a0and\u00a012th\u00a0on our list, and they are up by 2.7% to 129.75%, year to date.\nFor nuclear energy, let\u2019s look at the stocks that are part of the list of the\u00a012 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Buy Today. In this list, roughly seven nuclear energy stocks have considerable exposure to power generation. Their one year share price appreciation ranges between 79.8% to 11.38%, and the top three performing stocks are ranked\u00a03rd,\u00a05th,\u00a0and\u00a012th.\u00a0As a refresher, nuclear energy is popular these days because of its potential to provide clean energy to AI data centers.\nFinally, another sector that might change the world is robotics. Some Wall Street analysts are gushing over the sector as they believe that humanoid robots in particular can unlock a $30 trillion opportunity. This is on the back of these robots being able to perform jobs that humans are unwilling or unsuited for, and even Elon Musk is bullish on them as he believes that his car company could benefit from this unstoppable demand and become worth $25 trillion as a result. For more details, you can check out\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the stocks that can change the world, we started with our coverage of\u00a010 Stocks That Will Change the Future,\u00a0analyzed their performance, and fine tuned the list to align with today\u2019s hottest industries. Then, we scanned media reports for sectors such as AI, self driving, gene editing, weight loss drugs, and robotics. From these reports, a stock was chosen if it was mentioned in three or more reports. This yielded a final list of five new stocks.\nFor these stocks, we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q1 2024: 186\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the most popular stock in the media when it comes world changing technologies. This is because it can transform the world through artificial intelligence and robotics, according to media reports. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers products such as its GR00T model to make AI powered humanoid robots and the Thor system on chip processor for robots.\nThis means that the firm provides an end to end platform that directly targets the robotics industry and is more relevant than say, Rockwell Automation\u2019s products. On the AI front, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s GPUs are industry leaders in performance and offer users the key ability to fine tune performance via CUDA. At the same time, the firm\u2019s AI leadership, which has also led to a tight GPU supply and higher prices, could spur big tech into action and develop its own products to relieve some of the pressure. Additionally, any worries about product execution, as evidenced by the recent reports of Blackwel GPU delays, could lead to headwinds for the shares.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s management shared details for Blackwell during the\u00a0Q1 2025 earnings call:\n\u201cAt GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper. The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion parameter scale AI. Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks that will change the world. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this list, roughly seven nuclear energy stocks have considerable exposure to power generation. Their one year share price appreciation ranges between 79.8% to 11.38%, and the top three performing stocks are ranked\u00a03rd,\u00a05th,\u00a0and\u00a012th.\u00a0As a refresher, nuclear energy is popular these days because of its potential to provide clean energy to AI data centers.\nFinally, another sector that might change the world is robotics. Some Wall Street analysts are gushing over the sector as they believe that humanoid robots in particular can unlock a $30 trillion opportunity. This is on the back of these robots being able to perform jobs that humans are unwilling or unsuited for, and even Elon Musk is bullish on them as he believes that his car company could benefit from this unstoppable demand and become worth $25 trillion as a result. For more details, you can check out\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the stocks that can change the world, we started with our coverage of\u00a010 Stocks That Will Change the Future,\u00a0analyzed their performance, and fine tuned the list to align with today\u2019s hottest industries. Then, we scanned media reports for sectors such as AI, self driving, gene editing, weight loss drugs, and robotics. From these reports, a stock was chosen if it was mentioned in three or more reports. This yielded a final list of five new stocks.\nFor these stocks, we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q1 2024: 186\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the most popular stock in the media when it comes world changing technologies. This is because it can transform the world through artificial intelligence and robotics, according to media reports. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers products such as its GR00T model to make AI powered humanoid robots and the Thor system on chip processor for robots.\nThis means that the firm provides an end to end platform that directly targets the robotics industry and is more relevant than say, Rockwell Automation\u2019s products. On the AI front, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s GPUs are industry leaders in performance and offer users the key ability to fine tune performance via CUDA. At the same time, the firm\u2019s AI leadership, which has also led to a tight GPU supply and higher prices, could spur big tech into action and develop its own products to relieve some of the pressure. Additionally, any worries about product execution, as evidenced by the recent reports of Blackwel GPU delays, could lead to headwinds for the shares.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s management shared details for Blackwell during the\u00a0Q1 2025 earnings call:\n\u201cAt GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper. The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion parameter scale AI. Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks that will change the world. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a010 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech stocks have been battered and beaten over the last month, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector down 13%. There's not one specific reason for the sell-off, but rather several different ones. Better-than-expected inflation reports at the start of July triggered a slight reshuffle on Wall Street, allowing investors to pull back from the reliability of tech and look into less stable investments.\nThen, midway through the month, the Biden administration proposed more stringent sanctions on chip exports to China. Combined with the start of earnings season at the end of July, many tech stocks slid in recent weeks.\nWhile a market dip can be worrying, it also presents many buying opportunities. The tech industry remains one of the best places to invest for the long term, fueled by innovative companies that never cease to push the envelope. Meanwhile, a sell-off generally means better-priced stocks.\nTwo attractive long-term options are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), with one leading the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market and the other home to a booming cloud business. Either of these companies' stocks would likely be real assets for any portfolio over the long term.\nSo, let's compare these tech giants and determine whether Nvidia or Alphabet is the better stock this year.\nNvidia's stock took a hard tumble over the last 30 days, falling 12%. The dip hasn't been great for current stockholders, but it has made the shares more accessible to new ones thanks to an improved valuation.\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is at one of its lowest levels in months, at about 62. That's high for a P/E and doesn't usually represent a bargain, but it's significantly lower than Nvidia's five-year average P/E of 80.\nThat average saw Nvidia's stock rise more than 2,500% since 2019, suggesting its current position is unlikely to stop it from delivering major gains in the coming years.\nMeanwhile, the company maintains a solid long-term outlook. Nvidia will post its 2025 second-quarter earnings on Aug. 28, an even that will likely boosting its share price. It beat Wall Street estimates for four consecutive quarters, and this quarter will likely follow suit.\nNvidia's chip rival Advanced Micro Devices reported second-quarter 2024 earnings this week. Revenue outperformed forecasts by $12 million as sales in its AI-focused data center segment surged 115% year over year. Considering Nvidia dominates the AI chip industry with an estimated 70% to 95% market share, it could be in for another quarter of beating expectations based on AMD's performance.\nA recent stock slump and an upcoming earnings release could be an excellent time to buy Nvidia before it's too late.\nAlphabet is another exciting way to invest in tech. While Nvidia dominates hardware, Alphabet has reached historic heights with the popularity of its software. Its Android, Chrome, YouTube, and Google have made the company a household name and a thoroughly reliable growth stock.\nAlphabet's shares have risen 178% over the last five years, beating the S&P 500's 82% rise. The company won over investors with consistent reinvestment in itself and financial growth.\nThe tech giant reported its second-quarter earnings last week, beating expectations in multiple areas. Earnings per share came in at $1.89 versus the $1.84 forecast. Net sales rose 14% year over year, landing $450 million above estimates. The quarter was the first time Google Cloud surpassed $10 billion in quarterly revenue and delivered over $1 billion in operating profit.\nThe company slightly missed on YouTube ad revenue, posting $8.7 billion against expectations of $8.9 billion. But sales in the segment still rose 13% year over year, rounding out an overall positive quarter for Alphabet.\nThe second quarter illustrated that Alphabet's advertising division remains a highly profitable business, alongside solid prospects in AI.\nBoth companies are among the most prominent names in tech, but Nvidia and Alphabet are otherwise challenging to compare. Their businesses operate in vastly different areas of the industry. Nvidia predominantly sells its chips to businesses, with part of its sales tied to the consumer market. Meanwhile, Alphabet's core business is digital advertising, and it is making impressive headway in cloud computing.\nHowever, these companies do complement each other. Alphabet requires graphics processing units (GPUs) like Nvidia's to run and expand its cloud services. And Nvidia's business is thriving by selling its chips to companies like Alphabet.\nAs a result, it's worth comparing their valuations to determine which is the better buy.\nAlphabet's stock is currently a far better value than Nvidia's, with a significantly lower P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. These metrics help determine a stock's value, and the lower the figure, the bigger the bargain.\nAs a result, Alphabet's stock is likely a lower-risk investment for now. With a lucrative ad business and expanding role in AI, it's worth picking up over Nvidia right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2025.\nNon-GAAP MeasuresTo supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nNVIDIA CORPORATION\n\u00a0CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2025.\nNon-GAAP MeasuresTo supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nNVIDIA CORPORATION\n\u00a0CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

        "Title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 28, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.63 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +133.3%.\nRevenues are expected to be $28.24 billion, up 109% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.14% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nFor Nvidia, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.25%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nvidia will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of $0.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.61, delivering a surprise of +10.91%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nNvidia doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "By Jamie McGeever\n(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\nHold on to your hats, or prepare for lift off?\nIn the end, the much-anticipated release of Nvidia's second quarter results on Wednesday is unlikely to push investors to either extreme, but Asian markets on Thursday may still open on the defensive.\nThe AI golden goose and world's second-most valuable company reported second-quarter revenue of $30.04 billion, beating estimates of $28.70 billion, and forecast third-quarter revenue of $32.5 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $31.77 billion.\nBut that doesn't appear to have sufficiently impressed investors who have gotten used to Nvidia's profits, revenue and forecasts smashing forecasts, not just beating them.\nNvidia shares fell as much as 3.5% in volatile U.S. after-hours trading, which should weigh on tech stocks and equities more broadly at the open in Asia.\nOr perhaps when the dust settles a little, investors in Asia will look more favorably on what appears to be a pretty solid set of results?\nThe backdrop to the trading day in Asia on Thursday was already challenging - Wall Street had closed lower before Nvidia's earnings on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq losing more than 1% and chip stocks down 1.8%, while the U.S. dollar and bond yields climbed higher.\nThe dollar posted its biggest rise since early June, gaining more than 0.5% against a basket of major currencies and declining against emerging market currencies for a second day.\nThe Asia/Pacific calendar on Thursday is extremely light, with only Japanese consumer confidence and capex data from New Zealand likely to pique investors' interest at all.\nInvestor sentiment towards China remains bleak and Shanghai stocks closed lower on Wednesday for a third day, sliding to their lowest level in six and a half months.\nSwiss investment bank UBS on Wednesday cut its 2024 GDP growth forecast for China to 4.6% from 4.9%, citing a heavier-than-expected drag on overall economic activity from the property sector slump.\nMore alarmingly, perhaps, it also cut its 2025 GDP growth forecast to 4% from 4.6% and next year's average inflation rate to 1.0% from 1.4%, indicating China's economic malaise is likely to deepen rather than lift in the coming year.\nTop Chinese and U.S. officials, meanwhile, discussed holding fresh talks between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping in the near future, the two countries said on Wednesday during high-level meetings in Beijing.\nThe discussion occurred during lengthy talks between China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, and U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan held against the backdrop of sharp disagreements between the superpowers, including trade and tit-for-tat tariffs.\nProgress, or another false dawn?\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to Asian markets on Thursday:\n- Japan consumer confidence\n- New Zealand capex (Q2)\n- Germany inflation (August)\n(Reporting by Jamie McGeever)\n"

The bullish NVDA stock performance is nothing new \u2013 since inception, shares have been up 321,400%, catapulting Nvidia to be one of the largest companies worldwide.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWall Street sees Nvidia as the leading chipmaker. The e company\u2019s success can be attributed to the explosion of investment in artificial intelligence (AI). OpenAI and Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) late 2022 launch of their wildly popular large language model (LLM) ChatGPT sparked a flurry of investment in the AI realm from big-cap tech companies like Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN). Nvidia has achieved AI dominance due to its Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), which are best-in-breed in terms of AI and machine learning. The company\u2019s chips can train large-scale AI models faster and more efficiently than its competitors, cementing its industry leadership position.\nNvidia is a bellwether because it is the fastest-growing company in the fastest-growing industry. Therefore, because of its robust fundamentals and sheer size, investors will be watching Nvidia\u2019s August 28th earnings report closely.\nBelow, I will preview Nvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings report with five must-see charts:\nI have long warned investors against using traditional valuations on exceptional innovators like Nvidia. For example, if an investor uses the price/earnings (P/E) ratio, the denominator is unknown. In other words, NVDA is growing so fast that a traditional P/E offers little value. Instead, investors can use a 12-month P/E to Growth ratio (PEG). From a PEG standpoint, Nvidia is undervalued. Based on Nvidia\u2019s forward 12-month PEG, the stock is trading at 1.13x, well below its ten-year median of 2.78x.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHistory doesn\u2019t always repeat, but it does tend to rhyme. From this point of view, NVDA\u2019s current chart pattern looks eerily similar to March to May when the stock flashed an A-B-C corrective pattern. In each instance, the stock corrected in a zig-zag fashion and found support at an open price gap before ripping higher.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, bears can point out that shares have reached the nosebleed 4.236% Fibonacci target drawn from the 2022 correction.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia has delivered positive earnings surprises in 17 of the past 20 quarters.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestors will be listening closely to see if there is any update on the company\u2019s highly-anticipated Blackwell chip. Earlier this month, Nvidia announced that the chip would be delayed due to a design flaw from one of its component makers, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Blackwell is orders of magnitude more powerful than Nvidia\u2019s last chip in terms of compute.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNevertheless, bad news on the Blackwell front may take some air out of the stock.\n5.\u00a0Nvidia Earnings Estimates\nThe biggest question that will be answered in the earnings report is, \u201cCan Nvidia\u2019s scorching earnings growth continue?\u201d Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest robust triple-digit growth for the current quarter and the full year 2025.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia is the leader in the burgeoning AI revolution. Whether investors own the stock or not, they should monitor Nvidia\u2019s earnings to get clues about the AI industry and the broader market.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Nvidia earnings highlight a busy end of August: What to know this week",
        "Author": "  Josh Schafer    \u00b7 Reporter",
        "Text": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told investors on Friday the \"time has come for policy to adjust.\"\nIn response, stocks finished the week near record highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC), the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) all rose more than 1% on the week. The S&P 500 is now within 1% of a record closing high.\nBut the market's rebound from August lows will be put to the test with a highly anticipated earnings release from AI leader Nvidia (NVDA) after the bell on Wednesday.\nEarnings from Salesforce (CRM), Best Buy (BBY), Dell (DELL), and Lululemon (LULU) will also be in focus, while a key reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge will highlight the economic calendar.\nOn Friday, Powell made clear to investors that interest rate cuts are coming in September.\nBut he did not explicitly signal how aggressively the central bank will slash rates as it gets this easing cycle underway.\nPowell noted the timing and pace of cuts will \"depend on incoming data,\" and markets quickly moved to fully price in four rate cuts of 0.25% by the end of 2024 on Friday morning after the Fed chair said the central bank has \"ample room\" to maneuver as policy enters its next phase.\nRead more: Fed predictions for 2024: What experts say about the possibility of a rate cut\nWith only three Fed meetings left in 2024, the looming question remains when the Fed would cut rates by 0.50% in a single meeting to reach current forecasts.\n\"We continue to think that if instead the August [jobs] report is weaker than we expect, then a 50bp cut would be likely [on Sept. 18],\" Goldman Sachs' economics team led by Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients.\nAs of early Monday morning, markets were pricing in a 36.5% chance the Fed cuts by 50 basis points by the end of its September meeting, up from a roughly 24% chance seen a week before, per the CME's FedWatch Tool.\nCapital Economics' deputy chief markets economist Jonas Goltermann argued the Fed cutting deeper than 0.25% because of weakness in the labor market may not be a welcome sign for investors.\n\"Investors may reasonably worry that if the FOMC feels the need to front-load policy easing ... it may be because the economy is slowing by more than the still very rosy outlook discounted in equity and credit markets implies,\" Goltermann wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\"As such, it may well be that a 25bp cut in September is in fact the preferable outcome for equity markets.\"\nWhile Powell spent a large part of his Friday speech emphasizing the downside risks to the labor market, the Fed will still have its eyes on an important inflation update on Friday.\nEconomists expect annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.7% in July, up from the 2.6% seen in June. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE rose 0.2%, in line with the month-over-month increase seen in June.\nPowell said on Friday his confidence has \"grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%.\"\nWith nearly all members of the S&P 500 done reporting earnings, one massive report has been looming: Nvidia.\nAs has been the case since the chip giant supercharged an AI-driven stock market rally with its earnings report back in May 2023, expectations for Jensen Huang's company are sky-high.\nWall Street expects Nvidia grew earnings by roughly 109% year over year, with revenue also jumping 99% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Updates on any potential delays for Nvidia's new Blackwell chip will be in particular focus.\nThe stock enters the print up roughly 160% year to date.\n\"We believe modest expectations for Blackwell shipments in FQ3 have been backfilled with higher Hopper bookings,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a recent note.\"We expect NVDA to report beat/raise results, in which upside will be driven by strong demand for Hopper GPUs.\"\nVinh, who has a $180 price target on Nvidia, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday that the stock still looks attractive even after a recent 30% rally.\n\"Being one of the best-positioned semiconductor companies, obviously levered to one of the strongest product cycles in AI right now, we think it's still attractively valued at these levels,\" Vinh said.\nCharles Schwab Asset Management CEO and chief investment officer Omar Aguilar said the release will be \"very anticipated\" for the broader market too.\n\"What I think is going to be expected by the market is to hear what is the outlook for AI and what is the demand for chips going forward as people continue to spend money in AI technologies,\" Aguilar told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\nWhipsaw movements in Nvidia and the other \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks have been a feature of the market's recent drawdown and subsequent bounce back.\nGoldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance this week that the back-and-forth action could be primed to settle down.\n\"I think most of the short-term volatility in [the Magnificent Seven] stocks is behind us,\" Snider said.\nThe rally in this group \u2014 which consists of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), along with Nvidia \u2014 between Aug. 5 and Aug. 19 added more than $1.4 trillion to their collective market cap.\n\"The trajectory of sales and earnings growth has been resilient, more resilient than a lot of investors feared coming into the second quarter,\" Snider added. \"Valuations are by no means low compared to history, but they're lower than they were several weeks ago, and we won't get another earnings report for a few months now.\"\nFor the first time since the start of 2022, hedge funds trimmed exposure to many Magnificent Seven tech stocks to end the second quarter, according to Snider's recent analysis of securities filings for the end of the second quarter. Amazon and Apple were exceptions.\nSnider said this move \"speaks to the anxiety we were hearing from investors heading into the second quarter earnings season.\"\nHe added that investors felt the stocks had benefited from the excitement around AI but also expressed \"some concern that that AI investment boom was coming to an end.\"\n\"In my conversations with investors, including hedge fund clients, there was very clearly excitement at the opportunity to buy some stocks that they already liked at lower valuations given the sell-off,\" Snider said.\nNow, after the snapback in tech stocks, investors aren't as convicted as they were when buying the dip in early August. \"I would call sentiment [around megacap tech] cautiously optimistic,\" Snider said.\nNothing like price to change an investor's feelings.\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, July preliminary (+4.2% expected, -6.7% previously); Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, August (-16 expected, -17.5 previously)\nEarnings: Trip.com (TCOM)\nEconomic data: Conference Board Consumer Confidence, August (100.1 expected, 100.3 previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller, 20-City Composite home price index, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.34% previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite home price index, year-over-year, June (+6.81% previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, August (-17 previously)\nEarnings: Bank of Montreal (BMO), Box (BOX), Nordstrom (JWN)\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Aug. 23 (-10.1% prior)\nEarnings: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Affirm (AFRM), Bath & Body Works (BBWI), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Chewy (CHWY), Foot Locker (FL), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HPQ), Kohl's (KSS), Okta (OKTA), RBC (RBC), Salesforce (CRM), The J.M.

Now, with the company\u2019s earnings scheduled to arrive after the market close Wednesday, traders will be glued to their monitors in preparation for any wild swings.\nNvidia shares slipped as much as 4.4% intraday Wednesday.\nGoing by the options market, Nvidia\u2019s results are expected to send its shares careening nearly 10% in either direction in the session following the report \u2014 a move that would shuffle some $300 billion in market cap. And that\u2019s just its own stock. The chipmaker accounts for about 6.6% of the S&P 500, making it the second biggest company in the broad equities benchmark after Apple Inc. It also has a more than 8% weighting in the Nasdaq 100, and it makes up 14% of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.\n\u201cNvidia is obviously the cleanest sort of pure play way for investors to assess the health of the AI infrastructure space,\u201d said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. \u201cSo Nvidia\u2019s earnings are watched because they have direct read-throughs for so many companies in the AI value chain.\u201d\nSeeking Revenue Growth\nSales growth will be the focus on Nvidia\u2019s results after earlier reports from AI darlings like Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. showed huge capital outlays producing relatively puny bumps in revenues. For five quarters now, the chipmaker has far outstripped expectations and promised even bigger hauls to come. It has done this by becoming the primary beneficiary of billions in AI spending, so any deviation from that trend would raise questions about the technology\u2019s promise.\nThat pivotal role has effectively transformed the once obscure semiconductor manufacturer into a key measure of US economic strength.\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a bellwether for the economy,\u201d said Shana Sissel, founder and president at Banr\u00edon Capital Management. \u201cBut it has become one because of the size and the impact of the stock on the overall market.\u201d\nAnalysts expect Nvidia\u2019s quarterly revenue to be around $29 billion, more than double what it reported a year ago. And they anticipate another boost in guidance for future sales. But there is one new wrinkle \u2014 the company has to give an update on its next-generation Blackwell chip amid reports of delays and design flaws. The company said in early August that production is on track to ramp in the second half of the year.\n\u201cConcerns about the Blackwell chip delay could weigh on the upside to expectations for fiscal 2025, making management\u2019s comments \u2014 especially a reassuring 2025 outlook \u2014 critical,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analysts led by Kunjan Sobhani wrote in an Aug. 21 note.\nParsing Commentary\nAny commentary about Blackwell on the call is going to be dissected like a Federal Reserve announcement, according to Howard Chan, chief executive officer at Kurv Investment Management.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s going to be mulling over every single word,\u201d he said.\nAnalysts and investors will also be watching for signs that another Nvidia chip, the H-200, is seeing demand that could offset pushing out revenue from Blackwell. If Nvidia delivers solid results with its current slate of chips, it likely bodes well for the next-generation product.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably a good sign if they put up really good numbers here and those are due to strong demand for H-200,\u201d Gabelli\u2019s Belton said. \u201cThat probably paints an encouraging picture for incremental demand for Blackwell into next year.\u201d\nRead the Preview: Nvidia Investors Betting on Another Blowout Quarter\nOf course, Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish on shares of Nvidia. The stock has 66 buy ratings, 8 holds and no sells, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its 12-month price target of around $145 implies a gain of roughly 16% from where they currently trade. Nvidia\u2019s valuation has also compressed, with the shares trading at a blended forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 38 times, down from 44 times in June and north of 60 times last year. The S&P 500 trades at roughly 21 times its forward earnings.\nConcerns about how long heavy spending on AI will continue and worries around the Blackwell chip weighed on the shares in the early August trough. But the rally since shows that investors are still willing to buy dips in the stock as Big Tech\u2019s AI mania shows few signs of stopping \u2014 yet.\n\u201cThe bar has been raised, I think, in the last few quarters,\u201d Belton said. \u201cIf you think about what happened with all the megacap stocks throughout this earnings cycle, I think the market definitely wants to see a healthy beat and forward quarter guidance above published estimates. I think this recent run up for near-term trading really matters.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nSuper Micro Computer shares fell after the company said it will delay filing its annual financial disclosures. The San Jose, California-based server maker requires additional time \u201cto complete its assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting,\u201d the company said in a filing Wednesday morning.\nMeituan\u2019s quarterly revenue beat estimates after its core food delivery business expanded, offering a positive signal to investors increasingly worried about domestic consumer malaise.\nApple took the rare step of cutting about 100 jobs in its digital services group, part of a shift in priorities for the critical division, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nSony is raising the price of its marquee gaming console by about 19% to nearly $550 in Japan, one of the most dramatic signs that Asia\u2019s No. 2 economy is emerging from a deflationary cycle.\nEarnings Due Wednesday\nPostmarket\nNvidia\nSalesforce\nCrowdStrike\nHP Inc.\nNetApp\nPure Storage\nOkta\nNutanix\nAffirm\nVeeva\n--With assistance from Brandon Harden, Jeran Wittenstein and Cristin Flanagan.\n(Updates stock moves throughout.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports\nHow Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis\nNeed 100,000 Balloons for a Convention?

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a011 Trending AI Stocks On Latest News and Analyst Ratings.\u00a0Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nInvestors remain cautious following a major global selloff that shook the markets last week on recession fears. Analyst warnings around sky-high CapEx of tech companies and lack of visibility over returns are also expected to keep tech valuations in check in the coming weeks.\nLast month, Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners, while talking to CNBC, highlighted a report from Goldman Sachs that said returns of AI investments might fail to meet investors\u2019 expectations.\n\u201cThe amount of capital investment in this sector, which is billions of dollars now, is so large that it\u2019s almost unimaginable that we are going to get a rate of return over the next few years that justifies the amount of investment,\u201d\u00a0 McNamee said.\nTalking to Bloomberg, JPMorgan Asset Management\u2019s Aisa Ogoshi said that there is some \u201cadjustment\u201d coming for tech stocks as she expects the AI-centric rally to diversify to other sectors.\n\u201cThe key is to keep an eye on the earnings trends. It\u2019s easy to\u00a0 panic in these times but really, just sit down and look at the numbers and reassess our positioning.\u201d\nAsked whether she plans to reduce exposure to AI stocks in the coming days, the analyst said she\u2019d be more \u201cselective\u201d when it comes to AI plays and will increase the quality of stocks in the portfolio.\nFor this article, we chose 11 trending AI stocks based on the latest news, earnings and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\nBofA said in a latest note that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the tech stocks presenting an attractive buy-the-dip opportunity.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\u201cVisibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,\u201d the firm said.\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company\u2019s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won\u2019t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has \u201ctriggered a mechanical sell signal\u201d based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).\u201d\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 11 Trending AI Stocks On Latest News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Is Nvidia's Momentum Over? Here's What History Says.",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) soared to record highs earlier this year, crossed the $1,000 mark -- and finally launched a stock split in June to lower its per-share price. The reason for the fantastic performance is simple. Nvidia dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, and this has helped it generate triple-digit gains in earnings in recent times.\nRevenue even reached records quarter after quarter -- and in the most recent quarter, it came in higher than a full year of revenue in 2021. This hasn't been just a short-term story: Nvidia stock advanced more than 2,000% over the past five years.\nIt's clear that this stock has shown plenty of momentum, but the story changed in recent weeks. Though Nvidia shares climbed in the days following its June stock split, from its June 18 high through today, the stock has dropped about 17%. At the same time, rivals are eager to take market share with their top-performing chips, and some experts have warned that the stock market is in a bubble that could be set to burst. Does this mean Nvidia's incredible momentum may be a thing of the past? Here's what history says.\nFirst, let's take a quick look at Nvidia's path so far. The company originally was known for supplying the gaming industry with high-power graphics processing units (GPUs) to make the sights and sounds of their products come to life for players. But the GPU's ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously made it suited for many other uses -- particularly AI.\nThis focus on AI helped Nvidia grow revenue from about $16 billion in a full year in 2021 to $26 billion in just one quarter today. This also helped Nvidia stock start its amazing ascent.\nOf course, Nvidia's path hasn't been a straight line upward. Over the past decade there have been ups and downs, and it's important to look at this history to see what happened after all of the down points. In every case, history shows us that Nvidia stock has always moved higher.\nThis happened even after periods of transition and uncertainty. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2019, Nvidia's gaming revenue suffered, falling in the double digits, due to excess GPU inventory and weak demand from China. Meanwhile, data center revenue roared to records, but this was early in the AI story -- and it wasn't obvious that AI would represent such a valuable area for Nvidia over time.\nWhat does this say about Nvidia's momentum today? It's possible that, as in the past, Nvidia stock could be in a period of declines -- this might be short-lived or may continue for some time. But history shows us that Nvidia has always found new momentum, and I would expect this to continue.\nToday, investors have gotten used to fantastic earnings growth from Nvidia, and they may not reward every bit of good news by piling into the stock. Investors may also be a little cautious about technology giants at the moment as some economists speak of a bubble ready to burst.\nAll this offers long-term investors the opportunity to get in on Nvidia -- and potentially other top players too -- at a reasonable valuation. Though Nvidia, trading at about 40 times forward earnings estimates, isn't cheap, it trades at a fair price considering its market leadership and the innovation that could keep it in that position.\nRight now, as you decide whether to invest in Nvidia, it's important to take a long-term view of the company and its stock performance potential. Nvidia's long-term story remains strong. The company generates billion-dollar earnings today, with growth in the triple digits, and we're in the early days of the AI story.\nAnalysts predict that today's $215 billion AI market will soar to $1 trillion by the end of the decade. Even if the market falls a bit short of this expectation, Nvidia still could have a bright future. It's the go-to company for premium GPUs, it's pledged to update these chips on an annual basis, and it's focused on new areas of AI growth such as sovereign AI.\nHistory shows us that even if Nvidia shares wallow in the doldrums for a time, this stock's long-term momentum is far from over -- and that's why it's still a top technology stock to buy and hold.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "It's been a wild couple of weeks for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader have moved by 5% in seemingly every session as investors struggle to value the dominant data center GPU maker.\nNvidia shares soared since the start of 2023 as its hardware is fueling the generative AI boom. Now there are legitimate questions about the economy's strength, the potential influence of AI, and how quickly Nvidia can grow.\nConsequently, the stock has fallen 23% since the Nasdaq Composite peaked a month ago. However, one analyst sees the sell-off as a buying opportunity.\nLast week, New Street Research upgraded its rating on Nvidia from neutral in response to the sell-off. The research firm noted the stock had fallen 26% from its June peak, underperforming peers that are also competing in data center AI.\nIt sees the sell-off as a buying opportunity and gave the AI stock a price target of $120, implying upside potential of 15%.\nNvidia shares have pulled back as the AI rally became overheated, but there's a good argument that the stock is oversold. The brief scare over a potential economic recession seems to have passed for now. Nvidia's momentum remains strong, though the company may be experiencing a delay in its new Blackwell platform.\nThe latest update from Taiwan Semiconductor Corporation, the world's biggest chip manufacturer, showed July revenue that increased 45% from a year ago and 24% from June, a sign that the last month of Nvidia's second quarter was strong in the semiconductor industry and for AI chips.\nNvidia will report second-quarter earnings at the month's end and looks set to deliver another round of strong growth. After the recent pullback, the stock looks more reasonable at a forward price-to-earnings ratio\u00a0of 40.\nIf market sentiment improves and Nvidia's second-quarter numbers are strong, the stock could be significantly higher by the month's end.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe AI industry continues to be highly dynamic, with significant growth anticipated across various sectors in 2024. The expansion of generative AI, which saw exponential growth in 2023, is expected to continue this year, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value as businesses move from pilot projects to broader implementation. This shift suggests that 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI as companies aim to leverage capabilities more fully to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate across different industries. The market for generative AI is forecasted to grow rapidly, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 60%, reaching a valuation of around $37 billion by 2028. This growth is fueled by the widespread adoption of AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThe AI revolution is already transforming operations across the world by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and enhancing predictive capabilities. The healthcare sector, for example, is poised for substantial advancements due to AI, with the market expected to grow to around $188 billion by 2030, driven by innovations in genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. Edge computing is another area likely to see significant development in 2024, as it becomes increasingly critical for enabling AI applications that require real-time data processing. The move towards edge computing, where data is processed closer to the source, is expected to reduce latency and improve the performance of AI systems, particularly in sectors like autonomous vehicles, IoT, and industrial automation.\nThis trend underscores the growing importance of a robust semiconductor supply chain, especially as global trade tensions and geopolitical events continue to impact the availability of critical components like chips. Experts also emphasize the growing importance of ethical considerations and responsible AI. As AI technologies become more deeply embedded in various aspects of society, concerns around privacy, bias, and security are likely to intensify, prompting calls for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. The rapid growth will also bring challenges related to talent acquisition, supply chain management, and the need for responsible AI practices. As such, the industry is likely to be marked by both tremendous opportunities and complex challenges in the near term.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

Multiple concerns about the production ramps of Blackwell, the latest AI chips being marketed by the firm, were also addressed during the earnings call. The CFO revealed that the firm had shipped customer samples of the Blackwell architecture in the second quarter, and the production ramp for the chip was scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026.\nFollowing the earnings call, Wall Street analysts have reiterated their bullish calls on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. Raymond James raised the price target on the stock to $140 from $120 and kept a Strong Buy rating, noting that Blackwell delays appeared better than feared and management was forecasting a strong ramp in Q4. The advisory further detailed that Hopper demand continued to be healthy with further growth expected in FQ4.\nOverall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of our list of trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news.

        "Text": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is back near all-time highs.\nA recent rally in tech, including a nearly 30% pop in Nvidia (NVDA), has helped bring the index up more than 7% since its Aug. 5 bottom.\nIn that time, the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 have added more than $1.4 trillion in market cap, nearly half of the S&P 500's $3.2 trillion market cap gain since Aug. 5.\nAfter a massive drawdown in July, the recent surge helped bring the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) out of correction in 11 days, marking its shortest correction since October 2011.\nNed Davis Research chief US strategist Ed Clissold recently told Yahoo Finance that given how tech led the losses in the drawdown, it \"makes sense that they're going to rebound.\"\nAnd now, some of the largest names in the sector are sitting back near 52-week highs ahead of a crucial earnings report from Nvidia on Aug. 28.\nDuring second quarter earnings season, some of Nvidia's AI-powered rivals offered a mixed bag of results that struggled to live up to Wall Street's expectations. \n\"This would be the ninth day in a row the S&P is up,\" Niles Investment Management founder Dan Niles told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \"It's the longest streak since 2004. I wouldn't necessarily be pushing that into an Nvidia print.\n\"But I think if you're not worried about what happens the day after and you're thinking about this over a multiyear period of time, it should be in pretty good shape.\"\nAnd while the AI trade has once again been leading the market's latest leg higher, there have been promising developments under the surface at play too.\nThe S&P 500 equal-weighted index (^SPXEW), which is less influenced than the cap-weighted S&P by moves in Big Tech, just hit a new record high. Sectors including Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Health Care (XLV) are now sitting at 52-week highs, while Financials (XLF) are currently at a record level.\n\"This has been a really healthy rally in our view,\" Abby Yoder, JPMorgan US equity strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"It has been this broadening out. Breadth is the best that it's been since the summer of last year. In terms of the participation across different sectors, different names.\"\nStill, the S&P 500 is up almost 18% this year, outpacing the equal-weighted index's nearly 9% this year.\n\"The reality is that in bull markets, all sectors typically go up,\" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\nIn July, Gordon's team at Schwab pointed out in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook that the amount of S&P 500 companies outperforming the index on a rolling two-month basis had fallen to a historic low.\nSince then, that narrative has fully flipped. As of Monday's close, roughly 58% of members in the S&P 500 were outperforming the index, the largest swath of outperformance since November 2022, when the current bull market began.\n\"The trend is much more important,\" Gordon said. \"Across those metrics, things look relatively healthy.\"\nRecent economic data has showed a slowing, but still growing, US economy, and market action over the last few weeks is in line with the soft-landing-fueled broadening out trade strategists have been discussing since the start of 2024. \nAnd though tech will likely still contribute to the rally, JPMorgan's Yoder said the rotation in other areas could have more room as the \"growth backdrop does look healthy and we're about to embark on a Fed [interest rate] cutting cycle as well.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is back near all-time highs.\nA recent rally in tech, including a nearly 30% pop in Nvidia (NVDA), has helped bring the index up more than 7% since its Aug. 5 bottom.\nIn that time, the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 have added more than $1.4 trillion in market cap, nearly half of the S&P 500's $3.2 trillion market cap gain since Aug. 5.\nAfter a massive drawdown in July, the recent surge helped bring the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) out of correction in 11 days, marking its shortest correction since October 2011.\nNed Davis Research chief US strategist Ed Clissold recently told Yahoo Finance that given how tech led the losses in the drawdown, it \"makes sense that they're going to rebound.\"\nAnd now, some of the largest names in the sector are sitting back near 52-week highs ahead of a crucial earnings report from Nvidia on Aug. 28.\nDuring second quarter earnings season, some of Nvidia's AI-powered rivals offered a mixed bag of results that struggled to live up to Wall Street's expectations. \n\"This would be the ninth day in a row the S&P is up,\" Niles Investment Management founder Dan Niles told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \"It's the longest streak since 2004. I wouldn't necessarily be pushing that into an Nvidia print.\n\"But I think if you're not worried about what happens the day after and you're thinking about this over a multiyear period of time, it should be in pretty good shape.\"\nAnd while the AI trade has once again been leading the market's latest leg higher, there have been promising developments under the surface at play too.\nThe S&P 500 equal-weighted index (^SPXEW), which is less influenced than the cap-weighted S&P by moves in Big Tech, just hit a new record high. Sectors including Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Health Care (XLV) are now sitting at 52-week highs, while Financials (XLF) are currently at a record level.\n\"This has been a really healthy rally in our view,\" Abby Yoder, JPMorgan US equity strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"It has been this broadening out. Breadth is the best that it's been since the summer of last year. In terms of the participation across different sectors, different names.\"\nStill, the S&P 500 is up almost 18% this year, outpacing the equal-weighted index's nearly 9% this year.\n\"The reality is that in bull markets, all sectors typically go up,\" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\nIn July, Gordon's team at Schwab pointed out in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook that the amount of S&P 500 companies outperforming the index on a rolling two-month basis had fallen to a historic low.\nSince then, that narrative has fully flipped. As of Monday's close, roughly 58% of members in the S&P 500 were outperforming the index, the largest swath of outperformance since November 2022, when the current bull market began.\n\"The trend is much more important,\" Gordon said. \"Across those metrics, things look relatively healthy.\"\nRecent economic data has showed a slowing, but still growing, US economy, and market action over the last few weeks is in line with the soft-landing-fueled broadening out trade strategists have been discussing since the start of 2024. \nAnd though tech will likely still contribute to the rally, JPMorgan's Yoder said the rotation in other areas could have more room as the \"growth backdrop does look healthy and we're about to embark on a Fed [interest rate] cutting cycle as well.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock After Its 600% Surge? Wall Street Has a Clear Answer.",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Many experts see artificial intelligence (AI) as the investment opportunity of a lifetime. While the market is still nascent, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has already benefited substantially. Since January 2023, its trailing-12-month revenue has nearly tripled and shares have surged more than 600%.\nAfter those astonishing gains, some investors may worry it's too late to buy Nvidia stock, but Wall Street remains bullish. Sixty-one analysts follow the semiconductor company, according to CNN Business. Within that group, 92% (56 analysts) rate the stock a buy, and the remaining 8% (5 analysts) rate the stock a hold. Not a single analyst recommends selling right now.\nEven more compelling, Nvidia carries a median 12-month price target of $140 per share, which implies 35% upside from its current share price of $104. Suffice it to say Wall Street analysts generally do not believe it's too late to buy Nvidia. In fact, most view the current price as a reasonable entry point for investors.\nNvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Analysts estimate its market share in AI processors between 70% and 95%, and Forrester Research recently wrote, \"Nvidia sets the pace for AI infrastructure worldwide. Without Nvidia GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\nFew companies achieve that level of dominance, but Nvidia managed to threat that needle for three reasons. First, its GPUs are the fastest data center accelerators on the market. Second, it offers a robust ecosystem of supporting software tools that make its GPUs the go-to option for developers of accelerated computing applications. Third, Nvidia provides adjacent hardware to supplement its GPUs, such that the company effectively builds entire AI data centers.\nNvidia consistently crushes the competition at the MLPerf benchmarks, tests that provide an unbiased evaluation of AI training and inference capabilities across hardware, software, and services. In March, Nvidia Hopper GPUs running its TensorRT-LLM software won every test of AI inference capabilities. In June, Hopper-based systems gave the best performance on every AI training workload.\nHowever, superior GPUs are only one piece of the puzzle. Nvidia also provides adjacent hardware like high-performance networking platforms and central processing units (CPUs) purpose-built for AI. CEO Jensen Huang recently said, \"We literally build the entire data center and we can monitor everything, measure everything, optimize across everything.\"\nBeyond that, Nvidia CUDA is the most comprehensive ecosystem of supporting software for developers. CUDA includes tools for data preparation, model training, and deployment, which collectively streamline AI application development. That advantage will be hard to overcome because the CUDA ecosystem has been nearly two decades in the making, and Nvidia is still adding new tools at a steady clip today.\n\"Year after year, Nvidia responded to the needs of software developers by pumping out specialized libraries of code, allowing a huge array of tasks to be performed on its GPUs at speeds that were impossible with conventional, general-purpose processors like those made by Intel and AMD,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\nGrand View Research expects AI spending across hardware, software, and services to grow at 37% annually through 2030. That means Nvidia will have a strong tailwind at its back for many years to come, and the company is unlikely to lose its dominance in AI hardware any time soon.\nToshiya Hari at Goldman Sachs recently wrote, \"We believe Nvidia will remain the de fact industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive advantage that spans hardware and software capabilities, as well as the installed base and ecosystem it has built over multiple decades.\"\nThat said, Nvidia has reportedly delayed shipments of its latest Blackwell GPUs by at least three months due to a design flaw. Blackwell chips deliver up to four times faster training and 30 times faster inference than the previous Hopper architecture. That delay could drive worse-than-expected results when the company reports earnings on Aug. 28, which could cause the stock to decline.\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow non-GAAP earnings at 52% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends January 2026). That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 57.7 times non-GAAP earnings look reasonable. Investors interested in purchasing shares of Nvidia should start with a small position today. If the stock falls after the upcoming earnings report, investors should consider using that opportunity to build a slightly larger position.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Here's Why Nvidia Surpasses AMD as the Optimal Choice for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Investors",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's no doubt about it: AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) has been getting beaten by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race. AMD has been busy trying to close the gap, but Nvidia is still much further ahead.\nAMD recently announced its acquisition of ZT Systems, another attempt to close the gap on Nvidia. Still, I don't think AMD is the optimal choice for investors, as Nvidia still has several key advantages.\nAMD's $4.9 billion acquisition of ZT Systems will allow it to better design systems with thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs). This is key because Nvidia has had a long-standing advantage in this area. By improving its offering to large cloud computing companies and others that want an industry-leading supercomputer dedicated to training AI models, AMD may be able to compete with Nvidia.\nHowever, the hole AMD has to dig itself out of may be too deep.\nIn the second quarter, AMD's data center division (the segment encompassing the hardware most closely associated with AI model development) saw record revenue of $2.8 billion, which grew at a 115% year over year. Those are fantastic results in a vacuum that would thrill most investors.\nBut the problem is that those figures pale in comparison to Nvidia's.\nIn the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025 (ended April 28), Nvidia's data center revenue rose 427% year over year to $22.6 billion. There's no sugar coating it: AMD is getting smoked by Nvidia, with its data center business only a tenth the size of Nvidia's.\nThe other problem is that because Nvidia has already proven its product and established relationships with many customers and end users, it has built itself a bit of a switching-cost moat. AMD will have to prove its product has better performance than Nvidia's or provides a much better value proposition. If it struggles to do that, then Nvidia will continue eating AMD's lunch.\nWhile the ZT Systems acquisition is a step in the right direction, it isn't expected to close until the first half of 2025, which means Nvidia will continue building on its existing lead.\nThis doesn't bode well for AMD investors, and as of right now, I see no reason to buy it over Nvidia's stock, especially when valuation is factored in.\nUsually, when you see two companies competing against each other in the same industry and one is dominating the other, it earns the premium price tag. But that's not the case here.\nNvidia and AMD trade for nearly the same price tag on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) basis. Part of this is because AMD's ancillary businesses are in a slump, and its data center business hasn't significantly outgrown its other segments. This is why AMD's earnings are expected to grow significantly over the next few years.\nSo, if you consider analyst-estimated 2026 earnings, AMD's stock is priced at 21 times forward earnings. That's an expensive price tag, considering you have to wait nearly two and a half years to achieve it.\nThe same analysis for Nvidia's stock yields a two-year forward P/E of 30.2, which is also really expensive. However, the difference between AMD and Nvidia is that Nvidia has proven that it can generate huge growth by capturing the largest customers.\nAMD is still working on that, and it may be some time before it can go toe-to-toe with Nvidia.\nConsidering that both companies are trading around the same price tag, I have to give the nod to Nvidia, as AMD is just too far behind to warrant an investment, even if it may look cheaper looking ahead two years.\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "There's no question that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the flagbearer for the AI boom thus far. Even after the recent pullback, the stock is still up more than 600% since start of 2023, adding trillions in market value along the way.\nHowever, past performance is not a guarantee of future returns, and the AI rally is starting to broaden as investors look for alternatives to Nvidia, which may struggle to get back to its peak this year. One chip stock that looks like it has a good chance of outperforming Nvidia over the rest of the year is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), the fabless chip maker best known for its PC CPUs that is now seeing rapid growth from data center GPUs.\nLet's take a few reasons AMD can beat Nvidia in the second half of the year.\nAMD's main competition in the PC, or client market, is Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), the chipmaker that has dominated the PC CPU market since its early days and still has a majority of market share in the segment.\nIntel just announced its biggest restructuring in years, with plans to lay off at least 15% of its workforce through the end of 2025 as part of a plan to cut $10 billion in costs. The company also reported disappointing second-quarter earnings, issued weak guidance, and eliminated its dividend. In total, the announcement portrayed a company in disarray in spite of CEO Pat Gelsinger's having had three years to mount a turnaround at the legacy chipmaker.\nIntel stock plunged on the news, and its retrenchment seems to open up an opportunity for rival AMD.\nThe next battleground between the two companies could be the AI PC chip market, and AMD seems likely to have an advantage here. AMD CEO Lisa Su aid that the reviews of its new AI PC products like the Zen 5 platform are \"very positive\" and was bullish on growth in the PC market heading into 2025, calling it \"a good revenue growth opportunity for us.\"\nIntel also expressed optimism about its Lunar Lake AI PC chip but acknowledged that it could be a drag on margins because of its outsourced components, meaning it won't be the game-changer that Intel seems to need.\nAMD also has much more momentum in the client segment at the moment, with second-quarter revenue in that segment jumped 49% to $1.5 billion. Intel, meanwhile, reported just 9% growth in that segment to $7.4 billion.\nExpect AMD to continue gaining market share from Intel in the massive market.\nAMD's Mi300 data center GPU is now available, and it's rapidly gaining traction. Data center revenue jumped 115% in the second quarter to $2.8 billion, making up nearly half of the company's revenue in the quarter.\nMi300 topped $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, and its customer base is expanding as Microsoft became the first cloud infrastructure to open general availability to the Instinct Mi300X. Instinct is AMD's data center platform, and AMD said that major server makers such as Dell and Super Micro Computer have Instinct platforms in production.\nData center revenue tends to be higher margin than other segments, which should drive AMD's profit higher in the coming quarters as the company expects strong data center growth to continue.\nThe company also just acquired Silo AI, Europe's largest private AI lab, which will help strengthen its development of generative AI technologies such as inference and training, as well as large language models.\nNvidia recently found a design flaw in its new Blackwell platform that's causing a three-month delay in new chips. There's still a shortage of data center GPUs, and the news could give an opening to AMD to grab more market share. It could also weigh on Nvidia's results over the next few quarters.\nWhile Nvidia's leadership in the data center GPU market isn't in jeopardy, as it's much larger than its rivals such as AMD, the Blackwell delay could also weigh on its stock price and cause some reputation damage. It may be the most meaningful setback to Nvidia since the AI rally began.\nWith Nvidia now trading at a market cap of $2.7 trillion and its growth now set to slow, its upside potential seems more limited than AMD's, which could double off its current market cap of $220 billion as data center revenue accelerates and it takes market share from Intel.\nRecent declines in the gaming and embedded segments should soon bottom out as well lifting overall results. It won't take much to deliver significant bottom-line gains for AMD.

        "Text": "Nvidia has once again demonstrated its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. The tech giant's recent earnings call, held on Wednesday, August 28, revealed a second-quarter revenue of $30 billion, surpassing initial estimates by a remarkable $2 billion. This impressive performance has sent ripples of optimism throughout the AI industry, potentially setting the stage for a bullish market response as trading resumes on Thursday, August 29.\nThe earnings call is eagerly anticipated by investors and analysts alike, as it has significant impact for the AI industry and wider tech sector. CFO Colette Kress announced that the company's revenue figures exceeded projections by approximately 7%, continuing Nvidia's streak of record-breaking quarters.\nAdding to the excitement, Nvidia projected even higher revenues for the upcoming third quarter, estimating between $32.4 billion. This optimistic forecast further bolstered investor confidence, with the next earnings call scheduled for November 20.\nKress attributed the company's remarkable growth to several factors, including robust GPU sales, mounting anticipation for the forthcoming Blackwell chips, and strong performance in data services both domestically and internationally. Notably, Kress highlighted significant gains in the Chinese market as a key contributor to the company's success.\nThe CFO also provided insights into the highly anticipated \"Blackwell\" platform, assuring stakeholders that the new hardware and software suite is on track for release amid strong demand. Production is slated to commence in the fourth quarter and continue into 2026, with revenues expected to climb. Kress emphasized that demand currently outstrips supply, a trend projected to persist into the following year.\nDespite the earnings beat, NVDA is down 2.1% on Wednesday\u2019s trading session. Following the earnings release, the stock fell 6.89% in after hours trading, and is currently valued at $116.95. Crypto AI tokens have followed suit, with NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) and Bittensor (TAO) trading down 3.54%, 5.55% and 3% respectively.\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell more than 5% on Wednesday, erasing gains from early in the session as chip stocks led the way lower during a trading session that saw all three major indexes close in red figures.\nThe sell-off in Nvidia and other chip names came despite a bullish note from Piper Sandler analysts published Wednesday, which pointed investors to a \"tremendous opportunity\" to buy some chip names following sector's recent sell-off.\n\"Fundamentally, NVDA remains the strongest player in the AI accelerator space,\" wrote Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar, highlighting the company's next-generation chip. \"We also believe that strong tailwinds from the Blackwell architecture coming in October will continue to drive revenues well into 2025 as demand exceeds supply.\"\n\"As such,\" the firm added, \"we see tremendous opportunity in NVDA stock with the price off meaningfully from highs of $140.\" Piper has an Overweight rating and $140 price target on the stock.\nDuring Monday's market meltdown, The Information reported Nvidia's upcoming next-generation AI chips would be delayed by three months, potentially impacting its biggest customers like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta.\nSubsequently, Nvidia issued a statement stating its next-generation Blackwell chip \"production is on track to ramp\" in the second half of the year.\nAlong with Nvidia, Kumar said Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) remains a \"Top Pick\" for the firm as it gains share in the traditional server market amid struggles with incumbents like Intel. Intel (INTC) stock last Friday fell more than 28% following a poor quarterly report.\nPiper Sandler's team also sees an opportunity for AMD should Nvidia's chips turn out to be delayed.\n\"We believe there is not a lot of truth to the NVDA chip delay, but if it is true, near-term this would bode well for AMD if NVDA is struggling with supply and/or timing of chips,\" wrote Kumar. AMD stock fell 1% on Wednesday.\nLast week, Nvidia jumped more than 12% following peer AMD's quarterly results showing Big Tech continues to spend on data center infrastructure, a promising sign for chip suppliers.\nChip stocks have been volatile over the past few weeks as Big Tech names have led the market downturn.\nSince the start of July, the Philly Semiconductor Index is down almost 15%, a move that Piper said prompted it to revisit its coverage and look for \"ideas that we believe remain well-positioned fundamentally.\"\nAlong with Nvidia and AMD, the firm sees ON Semiconductor (ON) as well positioned in this environment.\nEarly Wednesday, chip stocks attempted a rebound that was punctuated by the recent market meltdown that sent the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) into correction territory.\nNvidia stock fell more than 6% on Monday as the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks saw market cap losses of more than $650 billion during Monday's market plunge.\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a $2.6 trillion company, and it currently represents 5.8% of the value of the S&P 500 index. In June, Nvidia stock was sitting on a 150% year-to-date gain, which was responsible for one-third of the entire return in the S&P 500.\nBoth Nvidia and the index have been in a slump since mid-July, but there is a seismic event coming up on Aug. 28 that could reverse both of their fortunes. It's the date Nvidia reports its financial results for the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 31), and if past quarters are any indication, it could be an absolute blowout.\nNvidia designs the most powerful data center chips for processing artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, and demand from some of the world's largest tech giants continues to outstrip supply. Therefore, investors are waiting on the edge of their seats for the company's latest sales results; here's how I predict Nvidia stock will react after they hit the wires.\nNvidia's graphics processors (GPUs) for data centers set the benchmark for AI development. GPUs are designed for parallel processing, which means they can complete multiple tasks simultaneously. They can handle high throughput and typically have a significant amount of built-in memory, which makes them ideal for processing large volumes of data. That is key when it comes to training AI models and performing AI inference.\nAI applications could drive a productivity boom across the global economy worth trillions of dollars in the coming decade, according to many Wall Street forecasts. As a result, data center operators are replacing much of their traditional CPU-based infrastructure with GPUs to meet demand from AI developers. Nvidia's flagship H100 GPU has been the go-to choice since last year, but the company is racing to beat its own benchmarks when it comes to performance.\nNvidia's new H200 can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of the H100 while consuming half the amount of energy. Then there is the GB200, which is based on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, and it could perform AI inference at a whopping 5 times the pace of the H100. Blackwell-based chips will start shipping to customers at scale in 2025.\nNvidia has a tight grip on the data center GPU market. It had an estimated 98% market share in 2023, and even though that will shrink this year as viable competition comes online from other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices, demand is likely to continue outstripping supply.\nNvidia generated a record $26 billion in revenue during the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), which was a 262% increase from the year-ago period. It blew Wall Street's $24.6 billion projection right out of the water. The result included $22.6 billion in data center revenue alone, which represented 427% growth on the back of surging GPU demand.\nNvidia also delivered an incredible result at the bottom line, with $6.12 in earnings per share. It was a 461% increase and it came in comfortably above the Street's $5.59 prediction.\nWall Street also underestimated Nvidia's guidance. The company told investors it expects to show $28 billion in second-quarter revenue when it reports on Aug. 28, whereas the Street pegged that number at $26.6 billion.\nAnalysts have since played catch-up, and their consensus estimate has been revised higher to $28.5 billion, which signals Nvidia's own forecast might even be too conservative. We'll know for sure in two weeks.\nWhile the performance of a stock on any given day is mostly just noise, here's how Nvidia reacted to each of its last two earnings reports:\nNvidia reported its results for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter after the bell on Feb. 21, and its stock soared 16.4% the following day.\nNvidia reported its results for the fiscal 2025 first quarter after the bell on May 22, and its stock closed 9.3% higher the following day.\nBut the longer-term trend is crystal clear. Nvidia was a $360 billion company at the beginning of 2023, right before AI fever swept Wall Street, and its stock has surged more than 700% since then. In other words, a string of incredible earnings reports has created sustained upward momentum in its stock price, and I think Q2 will contribute to that trend.\nIf Nvidia exceeds Wall Street's sales estimate, its stock could jump by at least 9% the following day, as it did after its Q1 results. The response could be even more positive given the recent dip in the stock. However, investors should be more focused on the longer term.\nIf Nvidia manages to deliver $3.75 in earnings per share in fiscal 2026 (which starts in February 2025) as Wall Street expects, its stock would have to soar by 108% over the next 18 months just to maintain its current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 58.2.\nGranted, that P/E ratio is quite expensive relative to the Nasdaq-100, which trades at a P/E ratio of 29.6, but it might be temporarily justifiable given Nvidia's lightning-paced growth.\nI say \"temporarily\" because this dream run will come to an end, eventually. Competition is growing in the market for AI data center chips, and as is the case with every technology, the further development of AI past a certain point will yield diminishing returns, which will shrink demand. It's difficult to predict exactly when that will happen, but investors should be wary of holding the stock blindly in the hope of earning the same returns Nvidia delivered in the past.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 18 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nGrowth investors have been piling into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past few months as a variety of factors, including rapid technological advancements, soaring investment, and widespread adoption across sectors drive interest towards the AI business. Some important metrics illustrate this phenomenon. The global AI market was valued at approximately $142.3 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 36%, reaching nearly $2 trillion by 2030. In 2024 alone, the AI market is expected to expand by around 40%, a pace that far outstrips the broader technology sector and the overall global economy, which is predicted to grow at a more modest 2.7%.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThis explosive growth is driven by the increasing integration of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing. Investment in AI is surging, with companies recognizing its potential to revolutionize business operations and deliver significant returns. According to PwC, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with North America and China accounting for nearly 70% of this value. In 2024, corporate investment in AI is expected to surpass $500 billion, driven by companies seeking to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate their product offerings.\nIndustry experts are increasingly bullish on the long-term prospects for AI stocks. According to a survey by Gartner, 80% of executives believe that AI will be a critical business driver by 2025, with 75% already piloting or implementing AI solutions. McKinsey estimates that AI could deliver up to $6.1 trillion in annual value across industries, primarily through automation and optimization. This growing confidence in AI capabilities is reflected in the stock market, where AI-focused companies have consistently outperformed their peers. For instance, AI-driven companies have seen their stock prices surge by over 50% in 2023 alone, a trend expected to continue as demand for AI solutions grows.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nThese AI-focused firms are also investing in AI startups as they seek to diversify their businesses. NVIDIA, Apple, and Microsoft are all reportedly considering a huge investment in OpenAI, a California-based AI firms whose claim to fame is the launch of ChatGPT back in late 2022. If the rumors are true, the latest round of funding would take the valuation of the startup to $100 billion. For some additional context, this value is higher than the combined GDPs of 110 nations, the highest for any venture capital backed firm in the US since Facebook's IPO, and the most valuable private firm in the US after Musk-owned SpaceX.\nThis high valuation also follows an emerging trend in the startup universe. Research into the domain by Coatue Management reveals that up until June 2024 year-to-date, there were a total of 200 AI-related deals in the venture capital world, compared to just 7,000 for non-AI firms. The average valuation in these deals for AI startups was around $1 billion. On the non-AI side, this value was only $200 million. The average funding round for AI firms fetched over $120 million, while this figure for non-AI companies was around $20 million. The numbers highlight that AI firms, on average, are valued at five times more than their non-AI peers and raise six times more in funding.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Latest reports from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg reveal that the company is planning to invest in a funding round for OpenAI, the firm that launched ChatGPT back in late 2022 to kickstart the AI revolution. Other tech big hitters like Apple and Microsoft will likely also participate in this funding round. OpenAI would reach a valuation of $100 billion if the funding goals for this round are achieved. The reports come within hours of NVIDIA topping analyst expectations on earnings and guidance for the second quarter of this fiscal year.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, in an appearance on news platform CNBC after the earnings call, said that the company expected to earn billions of dollars in revenue from volume production of Blackwell chips in the fourth quarter and ramp up from there. Huang also underlined that hyperscalers only represented 45% of the total data center revenue of his company, emphasizing that NVIDIA was well diversified in this area, with customers ranging from internet service providers, sovereign AI firms, to industries and enterprises.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Before Aug. 28",
        "Author": "  Johnny Rice, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Did you know that just one company was responsible for more than 30% of the S&P 500's growth for the first half of this year? Take a wild guess at what company you think it is. Yes, indeed, it's Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker is the tide rising all boats.\nIt makes sense. Nvidia's technology is driving the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, enabling a technological revolution that some believe could be as transformative as the internet itself. Its massively powerful chips are a hot commodity, and that's putting it lightly. With the rest of big tech lining up at its door to get their hands on Nvidia's latest iteration, the company more than tripled its year-over-year revenue for the last three quarters.\nNow, all eyes are on the company's next earnings report, to be released August 28. Expectations are high. So, with the release fast approaching, is it a good time to hop on board the Nvidia train? Here are three reasons the stock still looks strong.\nThere was some trepidation in tech as a whole when the latest round of earnings reports kicked off. Although the numbers generally showed positive growth, they fell short of what many investors hoped, with the notable exception of Meta posting monster revenue growth. A major concern was the growing capital expenditures (capex) from most of Silicon Valley, especially from companies like Alphabet and Microsoft that build and operate the gargantuan data centers largely responsible for the internet as we know it.\nThese cloud operators spent huge sums of money in the last few years upgrading their data centers to be capable of training and running generative AI systems, and their spending is not slowing down. There's an arms race happening in Silicon Valley and no one wants to be left behind. Look at the uptick in capex for Alphabet and Microsoft over the last three years. Notice the big jump right as AI took over the news cycle in 2023?\nThis capex growth is only continuing and even accelerating. Alphabet spent around $32 billion on capex in 2023. It's on track to spend about $50 billion this year. This is great news for Nvidia, who is on the supplier's side of many of these infrastructure orders. Yes, not all of this revenue is flowing into Nvidia's coffers, but a sizable portion is. There will continue to be a need to upgrade and expand these data centers for some time, and Nvidia will be there to meet that need.\nThe hype around Nvidia's technology is almost entirely focused on its chips. Although this will continue to be the company's bread and butter, Nvidia is expanding its product offerings into a critical category: networking. In simple terms, data needs to travel. Traditionally, data centers used ethernet-based networks to handle this, but AI can create too much data too quickly for legacy systems to handle. There are other technologies that can be used instead of ethernet, but retrofitting data centers with this is extremely expensive.\nThat's where Spectrum-X comes in, Nvidia's new ethernet-based networking platform for AI. Single data ports can handle data speeds up to 800 gigabits per second with low latency, and they are still backward-compatible with slower Ethernet standards. This allows certain components to be upgraded without completely overhauling the data center's network infrastructure at once.\nNow, Spectrum-X is not the only solution like this on the market. Broadcom already has a similar offering, for example, but I think Nvidia is likely to gain significant market share here because its solution will \"play nice\" with Nivida chips. The components will be optimized to work at maximum capacity when used together. Nvidia is building an ecosystem that will reward clients for sticking with its products. This could easily be a multi-billion dollar revenue stream within a year or two.\nNividia committed itself to updating its flagship AI chip every year. That's quite a tall order and leaves little room for error. The company already seems to have slipped up.\nAfter a flaw was discovered in its Blackwell AI accelerator chips, the company announced there would be a delay in rolling them out. I think this is unlikely to have any significant impact on the company's bottom line. Its Hopper chips, which the Blackwells are intended to replace, are capable of meeting the current needs of its hyperscaler customers. Their sales will probably make up for any potential loss from the delayed Blackwell rollout.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is at the epicenter of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. It designs the most powerful data center chips for AI development, and demand continues to outstrip supply which is driving a surge in the company's revenue and earnings.\nAfter the closing bell today -- at around 5:00pm Eastern Time and 2:00pm Pacific -- Nvidia will release its financial results for its fiscal 2025's second quarter (ended July 31). The report will give investors a fresh look at the chip giant's sales, and what it expects for the rest of this year.\nHere's what you need to know!\nNvidia's official guidance points to $28 billion in total revenue for Q2, representing 107% growth compared to the year-ago period. That might be conservative, though, because Wall Street's consensus estimate has steadily climbed over the last couple of months and currently stands at $28.7 billion (according to LSEG).\nConsidering Nvidia delivered $26 billion in revenue during the first quarter (ended April 28), which was a whopping $2 billion more than the company had originally forecast, it's no surprise that analysts think a beat is in the cards for Q2.\nThe data center segment accounted for $22.6 billion of Nvidia's total Q1 revenue. All eyes will be on that number in the Q2 report because Nvidia's graphics processors (GPUs) for the data center are critical to AI development. According to Wall Street, it could come in somewhere between $24.5 billion and $25.2 billion -- any result above the high end of that range will likely spark a fresh wave of enthusiasm in Nvidia stock.\nTech giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms (to name a few) have each committed to spending tens of billions of dollars on AI data center infrastructure this year, and a significant amount of that money will flow directly to Nvidia through GPU sales.\nThat includes sales of the H100 GPU which set the benchmark for the industry last year, and the more recent H200 which can perform AI inference at twice the pace of its predecessor. But there's also an entirely new generation of chips on the way.\nEarlier this year, Nvidia announced a new GPU architecture called Blackwell. It's designed to accommodate trillion-parameter large language models (LLMs) which, until now, have only been developed by leading AI companies like OpenAI.\nBlackwell-based GPUs will be capable of substantially higher performance relative to their predecessors, and Nvidia says they will also be significantly more energy efficient.\u00a0For example, the new DGX B200 system combines eight Blackwell B200 GPUs and can\u00a0train AI models three times faster, performing AI inference 15 times faster, than the older DGX H100 system.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang says B200 GPUs will be priced at around $30,000 to $40,000, which is in the ballpark of what many customers paid for their H100 GPUs. In other words, given the substantial performance benefits, Blackwell will make it far more cost-efficient for businesses to access and deploy the most advanced AI models.\nAccording to comments from Huang back in May, Nvidia should have started shipping Blackwell GPUs to customers in Q2, with sales ramping up as the year progresses. However, a recent report by The Information suggests a three-month delay could be due to a technical issue with the next-generation chips.\nNvidia hasn't confirmed those rumored delays, but investors should listen closely for comments on Q2 Blackwell sales and any update to its guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2025. Huang previously said he expects to see \"a lot\" of Blackwell revenue this year, so any variation to the company's timeline could substantially impact its future financial results.\nNvidia stock has soared 765% since the start of 2023, when the AI boom really started ramping up. It's now a $3.1 trillion company, so even a small move in its stock can be worth billions of dollars to its valuation.\nWhile the performance of any stock on a given day is mostly noise, Nvidia reported its Q1 earnings after the bell on May 22, and its stock jumped 9.3% the following day. Remember, the company beat its revenue guidance by $2 billion on that occasion, so it's possible that a similar result this time around could yield a comparable increase in its stock price.\nWith that said, Nvidia stock is currently trading 7% below its all-time high following a steep market correction earlier this month, and if the company delivers weaker results than expected, its stock could slip into a much deeper drawdown.\nHowever, Nvidia stock appears cheap right now for investors with a multi-year time horizon. Wall Street expects the company to deliver $0.64 in earnings per share in Q2, which will take its trailing 12-month earnings to $2.17. That places the stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 58.3.\nAlthough that's almost twice as expensive as the Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 32, the picture appears very different when looking further into the future. Analysts predict Nvidia will generate $3.81 in earnings per share in fiscal 2026, placing the stock at a more reasonable forward P/E ratio of 33.2.\nIn other words, as long as Nvidia's Q2 report doesn't produce a negative surprise, its stock looks like a good value at the current price for investors who can stay the course for at least the next couple of years.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jacob Fox ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nIt might be one sliver of a larger revenue pie and seemingly only worth a brief mention during Nvidia's Q2 earnings call, but the PC gaming market seems to be doing just fine if Nvidia's latest proclamations are anything to go by.\nThe AI GPU giant has just announced its financial results for Q2 fiscal 2025, and in its earning call the company said that \"gaming revenue of $2.88 billion increased 9% sequentially and 16% year-on-year.\" Nvidia also says it's seen \"sequential growth in console, notebook, and desktop revenue and demand is strong and growing and channel inventory remains healthy.\"\nOf course, the company is now, by a very large margin, an AI and datacentre one. So it would be remiss if it didn't mention gaming's links to AI, mentioning Nvidia's ACE game-related AI generation tech and stating, \"Every PC with RTX is an AI PC. RTX PCs can deliver up to 1,300 AI TOPS and there are now over 200 RTX AI laptop designs from leading PC manufacturers.\"\nAI is what's driving most of Nvidia's overall success, of course. Looking at the bigger picture, Nvidia's results show a $30 billion Q2 revenue which is \"up 15% from the previous quarter and up 122% from a year ago,\" this being \"well above our outlook of $28 billion.\" Earnings per share have gone up from $0.25 in Q2 2024 to $0.60 in Q1 2025 and now $0.67 in Q2 2025. It's a slowdown in growth, but big growth nonetheless.\nThis growth continues to come from datacentre demand as everyone looks to try and remain on the bleeding edge of AI processing. Nvidia says that demand \"is coming from frontier model makers, consumer Internet services, and tens of thousands of companies and startups building generative AI applications for consumers, advertising, education, enterprise and healthcare, and robotics.\"\nThe company's currently pushing even more bleeding-edge changes, too, in the form of its next-gen Blackwell GPUs of which there are already \"functional samples\".\nBlackwell, by the way, Nvidia CEO Huang says is \"an AI infrastructure platform, not just a GPU. It also happens to be in the name of our GPU, but it's an AI infrastructure platform.\"\nHuang explains, \"Nvidia designed and optimized the Blackwell platform full stack end-to-end from chips, systems, networking, even structured cables, power and cooling, and mounts of software to make it fast for customers to build AI factories.\" Factories which, by the way, are \"building-sized computers.\"\nBlackwell in this context refers not just to the GPU, but the \"Grace CPU, \u2026coVS package, ConnectX DPU for East-West traffic, BlueField DPU for North-South and storage traffic, NVLink switch for all-to-all GPU communications, and Quantum and Spectrum-X for both InfiniBand and Ethernet can support the massive burst traffic of AI.\"\nInfrastructure aside, Blackwell is a GPU, and it's this that we gamers are excited about because Blackwell-architecture GPUs should come packaged in some of the best graphics cards of the next generation when the RTX 5000-series launches. And if Nvidia's growing gaming revenue is anything to go by, we can be at least a little hopeful.\n"

        "Text": "After the market closed today, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) published results for the second quarter of its current fiscal year -- which ended July 28. The red-hot artificial intelligence (AI) company has once again delivered big sales and earnings beats.\nNvidia's revenue surged 122% year over year, and its non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share rocketed 152% higher to hit $0.68. Meanwhile, the average analyst estimate as polled by LSEG had called for the business to report sales of $28.7 billion and earnings of $0.65 per share.\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) leader beat the midpoint Wall Street sales target by 4.5% and the midpoint earnings target by 6.25%. The company also crushed its own guidance, which called for revenue of $28 billion and an adjusted gross margin of 75.5%.\nNvidia's data center segment was once again the standout performance driver in Q2. Segment sales increased 154% year over year to hit $26.3 billion and accounted for 87.7% of overall revenue. Sales were also up 16% on a sequential quarterly basis. With tech giants including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet investing heavily to remain at the forefront of artificial intelligence, demand for Nvidia's AI-focused graphics processing units (GPU) has been sky-high.\nNvidia's GPUs have become the foundational hardware powering the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, and the company has a stark performance lead when it comes to delivering processors to power today's most advanced artificial intelligence applications. Thanks to the dominance of its CUDA software platform for utilizing GPUs for AI and other accelerated computing applications, the company has created an ecosystem with a clear-cut performance edge and high switching costs. If the company can continue pairing meaningful hardware advantages with industry-standard software tools, its competitive moat will be very tough to breach.\nWhile competitors, including Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, are trying to gain share in the data center GPU market, there's little sign that either is dampening Nvidia's momentum in the space. Some estimates put the company's share of the AI GPU and accelerator market at 95% or higher.\nWhile the data center segment was the key standout and performance driver, Nvidia's other segments also posted encouraging results. Sales for the gaming segment increased 16% year over year to $2.9 billion and made up roughly 10% of quarterly sales in the period. Meanwhile, sales for the professional visualization segment rose 20% year over year to hit $454 million, and revenue from the automotive and robotics segment jumped 37% to hit $346 million.\nThe sales contributions from these other segments may seem relatively small compared to what's happening in the data center, but they're still significant. Lofty expectations from Wall Street analysts and other investors mean that Nvidia needed to be firing on all cylinders with its Q2 report, and the company has delivered.\nIn addition to blockbuster Q2 results, Nvidia issued performance targets for fiscal Q3. The company is guiding for sales to come in at approximately $32.5 billion -- suggesting annual growth of around 80%. Management is also guiding for an adjusted gross margin of 75% and adjusted operating expenses of roughly $3 billion.\nAs with its Q2 results, Nvidia's forward guidance looks very encouraging. The AI frontrunner's sales guidance comfortably exceeds the average analyst estimate's call for revenue of $31.7 billion in the period, and its gross margin target suggests that the business is seeing little erosion of pricing power when it comes to data center GPUs and accelerators. For comparison, the business posted an adjusted gross margin of 78.9% in this year's first quarter and a margin of 75.7% in Q2.\nNvidia is now shipping samples of its next-generation Blackwell chips, and the company expects that the new hardware will be its most successful product ever. While there's still some uncertainty about the release timing for its first Blackwell processors, the new platform is poised to be a major driver of sales and margins.

The company has said the flagship chips perform artificial-intelligence tasks at more than twice the speed of its current Hopper chips while using less energy and providing more bespoke flexibility.\nTech-focused news outlet The Information reported that Nvidia had told Microsoft (MSFT) and an unnamed cloud-service provider client that a design flaw had been found in the Blackwell architecture, which could delay its production ramp and delivery dates by around three months.\nAI demand and Nvidia's commanding market share are predicted to drive the company's data center revenue as high as $150 billion next year, powered largely by this year's Blackwell launch.\nMin Joo Kang, ING Group\u2019s senior economist in South Korea and Japan, said that Asia's AI-chip trade growth has been booming.\n\u201cThe most remarkable thing about Northeast Asian economies \u2013 South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan \u2013 is the robust growth in exports fueled by an upswing in the global tech cycle,\u201d she wrote last month. \u201cStrong demand for AI-related semiconductors and their equipment is the main driver here, supporting overall economic growth.\"\nChina and Hong Kong still take center stage in the semiconductor industry, Kang added, while South Korea\u2019s trade in volume terms with China and Hong Kong has been shrinking since 2022.\nAnalysts at Wells Fargo recently reviewed export statistics from Taiwan.\nThey highlighted automated data processing machines as a data point historically correlated with Nvidia's data center revenue.\nMore AI Stocks:\nNvidia stock tumbles in tech slump amid questions over key chip\nMicrosoft exec warns of an ongoing problem\nApple earnings top forecasts, iPhone sales slip ahead of AI launch\nAutomated data processing refers to computers and other communications electronics that can gather, store, manipulate, prepare and distribute data.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) , the world's largest independent semiconductor foundry, is also Nvidia's largest supplier.\nWells Fargo said that Taiwanese exports of automated data processing machines in July totaled roughly $9.060 billion, up 85.5% year over year and 36% month over month.\nThis compares to May and June exports up 324% and 135% year-over-year, respectively, the firm said.\nWhile the July data reflects a strong uptick compared with slower trends in May and June, the firm thinks investors may be more focused on the three-month period ending July than on Nvidia data center results.\nThe release of the July exports leaves total exports for the three months ending July at $21.25 billion, up 141% year-over-year and down 4.6% quarter-over-quarter.\nBased on this historical correlation, this data would imply Nvidia's second-quarter 2025 data center revenue of about $23 billion, which is slightly below Wells' $24.6 billion estimate and Wall Street\u2019s estimate of about $25 billion.\nEarlier this week, New Street upgraded Nvidia to buy from neutral with a $120 price target.\nSince the peak seen in June, Nvidia's stock has pulled back by 26%, underperforming most other semiconductor stocks exposed to data center AI, the firm said.\nWhile New Street finds the correction \"healthy overall\" and recognizes some limited and tactical headwinds specific to Nvidia, it views the pullback as \"an opportunity to gain more exposure,\" the firm said.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of pain coming for stocks\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -14.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has lost 13%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +137%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.69 points to a change of +106.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.38 indicates a change of +25.8% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nvidia.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $28.24 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +109%. The $117.82 billion and $152.66 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +93.4% and +29.6%, respectively.\nNvidia reported revenues of $26.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +262.1%. EPS of $0.61 for the same period compares with $0.11 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.02%. The EPS surprise was +11.48%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has pulled back from its peak in June as the stock market seems to be debating the future of the AI boom.\nSome investors think the rally overheated as the new technology has yet to produce a \"killer app\" or make any major disruptions in the economy. There was evidence of this when Alphabet and Microsoft stocks both pulled back following their recent earnings reports as investors questioned the level of spending on AI infrastructure and wondered if those tech giants would get a return on those investments.\nHowever, there are plenty of AI bulls remaining, and among them is former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. In a recent conversation at Stanford University, Schmidt commented on the evolution of artificial intelligence, saying that companies were planning to spend tens of billions of dollars or even hundreds of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure. Microsoft and OpenAI, for example, are planning for a massive data center and supercomputer project, known as Stargate AI, that could cost as much as $100 billion.\nSchmidt went on to say, \"(OpenAI CEO) Sam Altman is a close friend. He believes it's going to take about $300 billion, maybe more...\" The \"it\" here refers to meeting their needs for AI infrastructure.\nContinuing, he said, \"If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market,\" though he added, \"That's not a stock market recommendation.\"\nStill, it's a reminder to investors not to take their eye off the long-term goal when it comes to AI as the buildout is only just beginning.\nKeep in mind that Schmidt's quote just refers to open OpenAI's infrastructure needs, so if that's correct, the demand in the industry is much greater than that.\nIn fact, Sam Altman is trying to raise as much as $7 trillion to expand the world's semiconductor industry in order to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI), or AI that is as capable or more capable than a human.\nAGI is OpenAI's stated goal, and other tech visionaries like Tesla's Elon Musk are working toward it as well. Investors should expect them to continue to build the needed computing power until AGI is achieved. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has predicted that artificial general intelligence is five years away, so the market is likely to see AI investment increase during that time.\nIf you look past the market volatility and doubts among investors, nothing has changed about the tech industry's expectations for AI. The race among the \"Magnificent Seven\" and other companies will determine the winners in the industry for the next generation and building the necessary infrastructure is crucial.\nNvidia remains the far-and-away leader in data center GPUs and other components needed to run AI models like ChatGPT, and it's likely to continue to dominate that market even as competition from AMD and Intel comes online.\nNvidia had an estimated 98% share of the data center GPU market in 2023, and the company's data center revenue jumped 427% in the first quarter to $22.6 billion. That growth rate will slow as it laps the initial generative AI investment boom that followed the launch of ChatGPT, but Nvidia will almost certainly grow at a high rate as the race to AGI picks up.\nInvestors can debate the proper valuation for Nvidia stocks, but the strength of its business and its future potential are hard to dispute. The demand ramp for its products still has a long way to go, according to the needs of AGI and statements from the likes of Schmidt and Altman.\nIn fact, Schmidt's biggest concern about the surge in AI infrastructure was finding enough electricity to power these massive data centers. While that could be a challenge down the road, taking his advice and buying Nvidia's stock now makes a lot of sense.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

As such, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Q2 earnings on August 28 will be closely watched, as they \"may hold the fate of the Big Tech vs. rotation trade,\u201d strategists noted.\n\u201cWhile AI-related capex from the Tech giants has generally been strong, investors are starting to question the high spending given actual AI revenues are likely to take longer to materialize,\u201d they added.\nStill, Barclays views the roughly 16% drop in European tech stocks, and the approximately 30% decline in some of its key players, such as ASML (AS:ASML), as potentially overdone. This outlook prompted them to re-enter European Tech with an overweight position this week.\nThe investment bank expresses a preference for the long-term secular growth potential and quality aspects that the tech sector offers, as opposed to the value-cyclical nature of other struggling sectors like Autos.\nThe recent sharp equity market movements have been intensified by the de-grossing of leveraged positions among systematic investors. Many leveraged trades involved shorting low-yielding Japanese yen assets to benefit from attractive carry.\nHowever, following the Bank of Japan's rate hike and soft U.S. employment data, the rate differential has shifted in favor of Japanese assets, forcing investors to exit these carry trades, Barclays strategists explained. This has led to a sharp pullback in liquidity-driven markets.\nThe bank\u2019s FX team suggests that yen weakness might resume once market positioning stabilizes and U.S. recession fears subside, but further yen appreciation is possible if the global rate-cutting cycle accelerates due to a recession. They observed a significant reduction in yen shorts ahead of the BoJ meeting and expect more closures since then.\n\u201cPrice action may stay erratic given summer seasonality and elevated volatility,\u201d strategists cautioned.\nNonetheless, they find the recent indiscriminate selling \"excessive\" and see buying opportunities for long-term investors.\nRelated Articles\nNvidia earnings the next key catalyst for Big Tech: Barclays\nEarnings call: Prestige Consumer Healthcare tops Q1 expectations\nEarnings call: Lincoln Tech sees robust growth in Q2 with revenue up 16%\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) roller-coaster week continued on Thursday with shares falling amid a broad sell-off in tech stocks. The plunge came in response to weak economic data this morning and the Federal Reserve's decision not to lower interest rates yesterday.\nAdditionally, close collaborator Arm Holdings fell sharply after reporting earnings last night.\nAs of 1:28 p.m. ET, Nvidia stock was down 7%, following a 13% surge on Wednesday and another 7% slide on Tuesday. At the same time, Arm stock was down 16.9%.\nNvidia and its chip stock peers had tumbled over much of July in what seemed to be a rotation out of large-cap tech stocks that have surged this year and into underperforming small-caps.\nInvestors got a respite from that sell-off yesterday as Nvidia surged in response to strong results from AMD, but selling returned in force today.\nThere was no company-specific news out on Nvidia, but a disappointing manufacturing survey from the ISM showed the weakest reading since November and initial claims rose to a one-year high, a sign that the job market is continuing to slow.\nThose numbers, combined with the Fed's decision to maintain benchmark interest rates yesterday, have some fearing that the company could be weakening rapidly. A recession is still a risk and a downturn could be catastrophic for the chip sector, an already volatile industry, especially for high-flying players like Nvidia.\nAdditionally, Arm stock sold off despite the company beating estimates, which could be adding fuel to the argument that AI stocks are overvalued.\nNvidia stock did begin the day in positive territory so shifting investor sentiment due to weak data seems to be the main reason for today's decline.\nThe stock's volatility could continue tomorrow, when the July employment report comes out, and markets seem likely to swing one way or another depending on the numbers. Don't be surprised to see Nvidia shares move several percentage points again on Friday.\nThe AI chip leader will have a chance to redeem itself at the end of the month when it reports second-quarter earnings. The stock could continue to fall ahead of the report, but most of the recent slide seems related to concerns about valuation and a broader rotation into small-caps to prepare for a lower interest rate environment.\nBased on recent commentary from big tech companies and results from the likes of AMD and Arm, demand for AI hardware remains exceptionally strong. Nonetheless, investor sentiment and economic data are likely to determine Nvidia's price movements until its second-quarter results are in.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Brent Thill, Jefferies tech research analyst, recently said while talking to CNBC that we are seeing a rotation inside the tech industry where semiconductor and internet companies are performing well while software companies are underperforming. However, Thill reiterated his view that in the back half of the year things will start to change and tech companies will start their rebound. The analyst cited a few software earnings that suggest no signs of \u201cdemand cracks.\u201d He said that many semiconductor stocks are now in the overbought territory.\nBrent Thill said the selloff has made software stocks more \u201cattractive.\u201d\nBut Thill also sees a broader rotation ongoing in the stock market, where sectors like financials and industrials are benefitting amid investor exodus from tech.\nAsked what is causing a sudden rebound in small-cap stocks, Thill said that interest rate cut expectations and a broader rotation out of mega-cap stocks have a role to play here, in addition to the M&A activity which has increased significantly recently.\nThill thinks the AI \u201cpayoff\u201d time is still years away and companies are still at the beginning of the AI spending curve.\nFor this article we compiled the biggest AI news updates and analyst rating upgrades/downgrades around AI stocks over the past few days. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) rapid run and soaring valuation have started to make some circles on Wall Street uneasy. New Street Research recently downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy and set the stock\u2019s price target at $135.\n\u201cWe downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.\u201d New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu said.\nNYU professor and valuation guru Aswath Damodoran has also been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has \u201cno idea what I\u2019m talking about\u201d or it\u2019s the market that just does not understand.\nAswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the \u201cdriving seat\u201d of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won\u2019t be as easy as the market assumes.\nRecently, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight.

The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages.

        "Author": "  Suzanne McGee ",
        "Text": "By Suzanne McGee\n(Reuters) - Interest in leveraged exchange-traded funds that allow investors to profit when shares of Nvidia fall grew steadily ahead of the chipmaker's quarterly results, according to data from some of the companies that issued the products.\nNvidia, which in June eclipsed Microsoft as the world's most valuable company, dominates the major stock indexes, making its quarterly results an increasingly high-stakes market event.\nIn a sign of investor anxiety about Nvidia's ability to beat mounting earnings expectations, the number of shares outstanding in leveraged inverse ETFs that offer a bearish view on the chipmaker grew far more rapidly in recent months than those offering leveraged bullish exposure, issuer data shows.\nThese bearish products are structured to deliver daily returns twice the size of any loss in Nvidia itself, while the bullish ETFs use derivatives to double any daily gain.\n\"You can read into that data the changing sentiment about Nvidia's outlook,\" said Will Rhind, CEO of GraniteShares. \"As Nvidia becomes more volatile, we seem to be witnessing greater interest in taking a position in the bear ETF.\"\nNvidia's stock dropped after its quarterly forecast failed to meet investors' lofty expectations.\nThe number of shares outstanding in the GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF soared 446% between May 21 - just before Nvidia released its previous quarterly earnings - and Wednesday, when the chipmaker issued its most recent results.\nThat compares to a gain in shares outstanding of only 85% for its bull leveraged product, the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF.\nThe discrepancy is even more pronounced in similar ETFs issued by REX Shares and Tuttle Capital Management. The number of shares outstanding in the T-Rex 2x Inverse Nvidia Daily ETF has increased tenfold since Nvidia's May earnings report.\nLeveraged ETFs tied to other widely-traded stocks such as Alphabet and Microsoft also exist, but the largest and most active are based on Nvidia and Tesla, reflecting the high profile and volatility of both companies' shares.\nSome new investors drawn to the leveraged bearish ETFs may be worried about volatility in Nvidia itself as each earnings report drives expectations higher, said Scott Acheychek, chief operating officer of REX Financial. Others see the ETFs as a way to hedge underlying long positions or manage tax obligations.\nTo be sure, the bullish products still dominate leveraged Nvidia ETFs in size and growth as measured by dollar value. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF has $6 billion in assets and has attracted $2.95 billion of inflows in the last three months, according to data from VettaFi.\nIts 2x bearish ETF, in spite of the dramatic relative growth, boasts only $69 million in assets, although it attracted $63 million in inflows in the last three months.\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee; editing by Michelle Price and Rod Nickel)\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia: The Path to $10 Trillion",
        "Author": "  Ethan Feller ",
        "Text": "Semiconductor and AI leader Nvidia (NVDA) reports earnings next Wednesday, August 28 after the market close and investors are waiting with bated breath. Nvidia's remarkable performance over the past two years is almost unfathomable, yet the company\u2019s expansion appears it should continue at this same rapid pace for years to come.\nHere, we will cover the path Nvidia has taken to get to its current position, what to expect from next week\u2019s earnings report and whether it\u2019s possible for Nvidia to reach a $10 Trillion market capitalization.\nThe results Nvidia has provided its shareholders with over the last 25 years is truly hard to understate. Over that period, the stock has compounded at an annual rate of 35.4%, yielding a dizzying 217,000% return. Even more recently, over just the last five years, NVDA stock has compounded at an annual rate of 98.5%, 30xing investor money over that time.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAt the depths of the 2022 bear market, Nvidia had a market cap of $250 billion; today, it stands at a staggering $3 trillion. The meteoric rise is a direct result of Nvidia\u2019s strategic focus on AI infrastructure through its data center products. Since the pivot, annual sales have nearly quadrupled to $80 billion, and are expected to double again by 2026. Even more impressive is that Nvidia boasts 53% net margins on that revenue.\nFueled by surging demand for AI-driven solutions, Nvidia positioned itself at the heart of the AI revolution. Nvidia\u2019s focus on strategic partnerships with major cloud providers, its continued innovation in AI software (like the CUDA platform), and its ability to foresee the massive potential of generative AI were key to the stock\u2019s unprecedented rally.\nPartnering with fellow tech giants such as Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) has been the primary driver of its growth. Because Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet run massive cloud computing operations, and much AI development will occur in the cloud they have plowed tens of billion into Capex spending. While this is hugely beneficial to Nvidia, it is also good for all three major cloud providers. It\u2019s a symbiotic relationship as Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft add more power users to their platforms and Nvidia sells them the hardware.\nIf we look at the current quarter earnings forecasts, we can put into perspective the incredible pace that Nvidia continues to grow both the top and bottom line. Sales for the quarter are expected to grow 110% year over year (YoY) to $28.2 billion, while earnings are projected to climb 133% YoY to $0.63 per share. Looking further out to the expectations are equally impressive.\nAlthough Nvidia had sat atop the Zacks Rank for nearly two years, as analysts were continuously upgrading earnings estimates, today it has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, which most definitely isn\u2019t a negative thing. There is nothing bearish about a rank #3, just simply that earnings estimates haven\u2019t been upgraded recently.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIt isn\u2019t just possible, it\u2019s likely Nvidia will reach a market cap of $10 trillion within the next five years based on current forecasts. Today, Nvidia has a one year forward earnings multiple of 48.9x, which is well below its five-year median of 55x. Incredibly, Nvidia has grown so fast that even though the stock price is up 20x in the last five years, it is still close to its cheapest relative valuation because of the incredible profit growth.\nTo get to the conclusion that Nvidia may be worth $10 trillion is of course quite speculative, however a simple extrapolation shows how it is not an unreasonable expectation. Earnings are forecast to grow 37.6% annually over the next three to five years, and if the stock grows at that pace while maintaining its current earnings multiple, it would be there in under five years.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor investors seeking exposure to AI and high-growth tech, Nvidia remains among the most compelling options. Despite the incredible run-up in its stock price, the company\u2019s leadership in AI infrastructure, strategic partnerships, and unmatched growth rates suggest that Nvidia could still have significant upside potential.\nAt its core, Nvidia is positioned to remain a key player in the AI revolution, with its GPUs powering the future of AI-driven industries. The company\u2019s focus on continuous innovation and its partnerships with major cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet provide a strong foundation for future growth.\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s valuation is relatively high, it is backed by extraordinary earnings growth that is expected to continue at a rapid pace. The company's potential to reach a $10 trillion market cap underscores its long-term growth trajectory, making it an attractive investment for those with a higher risk tolerance and a long-term perspective.\nIn conclusion, Nvidia's stock may be a buy for investors who believe in the future of AI and are willing to weather short-term market volatility in exchange for long-term gains. With its leadership in the AI space and strong earnings growth projections, Nvidia could continue to reward investors as it moves toward new milestones.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nAI stocks have pulled back considerably over the past few weeks and analysts believe this is exactly the healthy correction long-term investors were looking for. According to Bloomberg, Rob Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, said that AI stocks have stabilized at levels they can sustain for the rest of the year. The analyst said technical indicators now show AI stocks have gone from overbought to oversold territory.\n\u201cNow that positions have been unwound, there\u2019s an opportunity for traders to take positions,\u201d Sluymer reportedly said.\nMany others agree with Sluymer. Dan Ives of Wedbush reiterated his view that we are still in the early stages of the AI bull market in a latest program on CNBC.\n\u201cIf you look at what we\u2019ve seen from AI revolution to broader tech, it\u2019s been strong from an earnings perspective. And the growth scare that we saw, it\u2019s just a bump in the road to what I believe is the fourth industrial revolution playing out,\u201d Ives said.\nFor this article, we picked up 10 AI stocks that are making waves on the back of latest earnings, analyst ratings or important industry news. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPhoto by Javier Esteban on Unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nAnalysts are bracing for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings scheduled for a release later this month. Jefferies said in a latest note that the company will smash analyst expectations for the quarter.\n\u201cWe expect another strong beat in July and strong guidance into October, with beats of about $1B for the results and guide,\u201d analysts said.\nAnalysts at Jefferies also believe the demand for Nvidia\u2019s Hopper chips is strong.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\u201cVisibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,\u201d the firm said.\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company\u2019s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won\u2019t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has \u201ctriggered a mechanical sell signal\u201d based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).\u201d\nOverall,\u00a0NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Nvidia Earnings Review: Can Investors Still Buy the Stock?",
        "Author": "  Ethan Feller ",
        "Text": "Once again, Nvidia\u00a0NVDA\u00a0has reported stellar quarterly earnings, beating analysts\u2019 estimates on both the top and bottom line. This was the smallest beat since the artificial intelligence boom began and it seems analysts are catching up to the realities of Nvidia\u2019s growth. As the market comes to terms with this growth, I believe some of the extremely high returns for the stock may be in the past.\nWhile Nvidia may not replicate its extraordinary 100% annual returns seen in recent years, I believe it still stands out as a compelling investment for the future. The company maintains incredible growth forecasts, a reasonable valuation, and a powerful business model.\nHere, we will review the earnings results, address Nvidia\u2019s potential as an investment and identify opportunistic buying levels using technical analysis.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia stock is taking some heat following Wednesday's earnings, even though it was an unequivocally strong period. The hours after an earnings report, especially for a stock as popular as Nvidia, can often be subject to short-term market fluctuations, particularly around options expiry, so I don\u2019t put much weight into this immediate response.\nBefore we get into the earnings report, I would like to do a quick review of Nvidia\u2019s quarterly earnings over the past 18 months. Back at the start of 2023, Nvidia was bringing in a very respectable $6 billion quarterly, primarily from its gaming GPU business. But when CEO Jensen Huang decided to pivot towards supply GPUs and data center products to the burgeoning generative AI industry, sales would inflect vertically.\nSix months later quarterly revenues would more than double to $13.5 billion. Then another six months and they would double again to $26 billion. And yesterday, quarterly sales reached a stunning $30 billion, a 15% increase from just the three months prior. This type of growth at this scale is something we will rarely see in public markets, so in hindsight, the trajectory of NVDA stock over the last two years is based completely on reality, despite what many naysayers remark on the growth.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nJust as impressive as the sales number are the profits, as Nvidia boasts gross margins of 75% and net margins of 54%. For Q2 FY25, Nvidia reported GAAP earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.67, which was a 12% increase from the previous quarter and a 168% increase year-over-year.\nNvidia also ramped up its share buyback program, returning $15.4 billion to shareholders in the first half of fiscal 2025 through repurchases and dividends. The company's Board of Directors authorized an additional $50 billion for future buybacks, underscoring its commitment to returning capital to shareholders.\nDespite Nvidia\u2019s explosive growth, the stock is currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 49.5x, which is higher than the market average but below its five-year median of 55.6x. While the valuation may seem elevated, it reflects the company\u2019s dominant position in the AI and data center markets, as well as its ongoing revenue and profit expansion. The stock has priced in a significant amount of future growth, but it still offers a reasonable valuation given the company\u2019s strong earnings trajectory.\nNvidia\u2019s ability to generate record revenues while maintaining impressive margins suggests that its valuation could be justified for investors with a long-term horizon. Although the days of massive upside surprises may be behind us, Nvidia\u2019s leadership in AI, accelerated computing, and data centers ensures it remains a key player in these high-growth industries.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs we can see in the chart below, the price action in Nvidia stock has become increasingly volatile over the last three months, with the stock now amid a more than $40 range. For investors who are comfortable using charts to trade, this range can offer tactical spots to look for buying.\nFrom here, investors have two options: buy the breakout above $130 or wait for a pul back to around the $100 level.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs analysts catch up to Nvidia's potential, the chances of large upside surprises may diminish. However, this does not detract from Nvidia's long-term appeal. With earnings per share (EPS) forecasted to grow at an average rate of 38% annually over the next three to five years, Nvidia still presents a compelling growth story for investors.\nFor those looking to invest in the AI revolution, Nvidia remains one of the most attractive options. While volatility and short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the company's strong fundamentals, leadership in critical markets, and shareholder-friendly capital return program make it a worthy consideration for long-term investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Fatima Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Financial Media.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other artificial intelligence stocks recommended by financial media.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has now become a technology that most people are increasingly familiar with. With AI seeping into almost every aspect of life, from the ads you see on social media apps to the autonomous driving cars many consumers are shifting to. It's not an overstatement to say that AI has become part and parcel of everyday life for every person using technology today. Considering the widespread use and application of AI technology, this area of the market has become an exciting area to invest in today.\nWith the recent big tech companies' earnings being released, many investors are wondering what role AI is playing in the tech markets today, and how it will develop. On August 2, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi joined CNBC's \"The Exchange\" to discuss this very development. Here are some of his comments:\n\"I think what's happening is two things. On the one hand, it's macroeconomy, which has been sort of turbulent for a long period of time, and it seems to be now coming to an end, where we see it on the job market and people are seeing it on inflation and the 10-year coming down and so on. On the other hand, we see AI. People are very excited, they know it's gonna absolutely change the whole world, and that huge investments have been done by the hyperscalers in AI. But for us as a company, we've been investing in data and AI for the 10 years, and you know we see a steady growth revenue and customers getting value out of it, but theres been a huge deployment of capital... I think AI is gonna be amazing, it's gonna keep providing value.\"\nGhodsi's comments clarify the market's current opinion on AI, namely that this is an area of tech that cannot be ignored and must be invested in to the maximum. However, in light of such a market opinion, many investors may be beginning to wonder whether the huge amounts of investments being made in AI are justified or whether we are merely in what some may call an \"AI bubble\" that is definitely going to burst. Considering the immense value to be found in AI, though, many investors believe that such huge deployments of capital are, in fact, justified.\nConsidering the above, it's unsurprising that several big tech companies are part of the rat race to invest in and develop AI technologies. However, one notable absence in most lists of the best AI stocks to buy that are being made by financial media reporters is that of Apple. Many investors are beginning to take note of the fact that it is lagging behind other big tech companies that are rapidly developing AI tech. On August 6, Lightshed Partners' Walter Piecyk's shared his view on the smartphone maker's AI moves on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\".\n\"I signed up as a developer for the latest development or the latest release of iOS 18. I've been using the intelligent series - not that much better... There's a lot of work that's obviously gonna be done between now and when this is formally released. I just don't see it, for this year and for next year having some a big impact.\"\nInvestors may be better served by shifting to purer AI plays. For this reason, we have compiled a list of the best AI stocks to buy according to financial media, to offer insights into what companies are actually doing well in the AI space today. Our list includes some of the\u00a0best AI stocks to buy, according to analysts,\u00a0and some of the\u00a0companies offering the top AI SEO tools in 2024 as well.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nWe selected AI stocks that made the top AI stocks lists of various financial news reporters, such as Forbes, Motley Fool, Nasdaq, US News, and NerdWallet. We then shortlisted and ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest, by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

At the same time, the Dow added 0.24%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.21%.\nThe the stock of maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence has risen by 1.46% in the past month, leading the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 5.85% and the S&P 500's loss of 1.49%.\nThe upcoming earnings release of Nvidia will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on August 28, 2024. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $0.63, reflecting a 133.33% increase from the same quarter last year.

        "Author": "  Eleanor Pringle ",
        "Text": "It\u2019s not often staffers at the likes of Meta and Google are looking enviously at the lifestyle of others, but the going is so good at Nvidia that it\u2019s making Big Tech peers a little green.\nEmployees of the tech world have been discussing the compensation packages at the Jensen Huang\u2013led firm versus the likes of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta and Sundar Pichai\u2013led Google.\nOn Blind\u2014an anonymous forum for professionals in the software and tech space\u2014a user who says they formerly worked at Google asked Nvidia employees: \u201cHow rich are you?\u201d\nOne apparent Nvidia employee, who stated their net worth was around $3 million, responded that the wealth of employees \u201creally depends on your level.\u201d\nThe individual added they still have $3 million in assets left to vest and were \u201cvery comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cBought a $100K family car in all cash and didn\u2019t have to think about it,\u201d the post continued. \u201cThanks JHH [Jen-Hsun Huang].\u201d\nThe individual\u2014who said the car they purchased was a \u201cdecked out\u201d BMW X7\u2014added they had been promoted within the past year to an Ic6, a principal engineer.\nAnother user whose profile states they work for Snap wrote: \u201cWife and I are worth $14.8M at 32, none of us work at NVDA, but we live in the Bay Area and have some old-timer friends there.\n\u201cEvery single one of them is worth over $25M. It\u2019s nuts.\u201d\nAnother user whose profile shows they work for Meta chimed in: \u201cThe more I hear about Nvidia employees and their riches, the more jealous I feel. Anybody with me?\u201d\nMeta and Google did not immediately respond to Fortune's approach for comment.\nThe ballooning wealth of Nvidia employees is thanks to the rocketing share price of the company, and the organization\u2019s now famously attractive stock incentives.\nThrough Nvidia\u2019s employee stock purchase plan, staff can contribute up to 15% of their salary to buy company shares at a 15% discount.\nThis has led to notable examples, such as one mid-level employee who bought in for 18 years reportedly retiring with shares worth $62 million, according to Barron\u2019s senior technology writer Tae Kim.\nNvidia\u2019s shares have ballooned over the past few years in particular, leading to a corresponding spike in the net worth of shareholders like employees and CEO Huang.\nIn October 2022, Nvidia was trading at around $14 a share; today, it has risen to almost $130 a share.\nHuang\u2019s net worth, which is largely tied up in the chipmaking giant, has also experienced a boost: In October 2022 Huang was worth a little over $11 billion, at the time of writing, his fortune is valued at $112 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making him the 12th richest person on the planet.\nHis 3.8% stake in the company is so significant that he can afford to off-load hundreds of thousands of shares on a near-daily basis, worth an average of $14M a sale, without its having a massive impact on either the market or his stake.\nNvidia did not immediately respond to Fortune's approach for comment.\nWith millionaire status on the line for Nvidia employees, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that a lot is expected of them at work.\nIn an interview with 60 Minutes released this spring, Huang was told some of the words his team used to describe him, including \u201cdemanding,\u201d \u201cperfectionist,\u201d and \u201cnot easy to work for.\u201d\nHuang said those descriptors fit him \u201cperfectly,\u201d explaining: \u201cIt should be like that. If you want to do extraordinary things, it shouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201d\nStaffers at the Santa Clara, Calif.\u2013based business seemed happy with their work-life balance.\nWriting on Blind, another user whose profile says they work for Nvidia added the experience of working at the company \u201cdepends on the team.\u201d\nThey explained: \u201cI work 10 a.m. [to] 5 p.m. on weekdays and per week one or two nighttime meetings due to overseas collaborations.\n\u201cAnd people can WFH all days in a week, some of my teammates do.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia\u2019s earnings could turn around the ailing AI trade",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "The artificial intelligence trade has been losing its luster as of late. Shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), three of AI\u2019s biggest players, are down over the last month, with Google parent Alphabet dropping 14%, Amazon off about 8%, and Microsoft falling more than 7% as of Thursday.\nThe stock moves come after the companies, along with fellow hyperscaler Meta (META), confirmed they\u2019ll continue to pour billions of dollars into building out their AI infrastructure over the coming quarters \u2014 without providing much insight into when they\u2019re going to turn all of that spending into revenue. That, along with the recent market turmoil, has put a damper on AI company stocks.\nBut the most important component of the AI trade, Nvidia (NVDA), still has to report its earnings. The chip company\u2019s performance could turn around the AI trade more than any hyperscaler. Unlike those software firms, revenue hasn\u2019t been a problem for Nvidia. Still, if it falls short of Wall Street\u2019s already sky-high expectations, it could bring the AI trend down with it.\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft\u2019s AI spending might be giving investors pause, but it\u2019s helping pad Nvidia\u2019s bottom line. The company\u2019s Hopper AI chips are the most sought-after on the market, and the firm is set to begin ramping up production of its Blackwell line later this year.\nThe company controls 80% to 95% of the market for high-powered AI chips, according to Reuters. That means every time a company says it's spending on AI capabilities, chances are it\u2019s buying up, or at least using, Nvidia\u2019s processors.\nBut Nvidia\u2019s second quarter report also marks the start of what will be several quarters of difficult year-over-year revenue growth comparisons. The company\u2019s fiscal Q2 2024 revenue came in at $13.5 billion, up 101% year over year. Data center revenue topped $10.3 billion, up 141%.\nEach subsequent quarter has seen ever more impressive year-over-year gains for the chip giant. But that party won\u2019t last forever. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia reported revenue of $26 billion, a 262% increase from the $7.19 billion the company reported in the prior year.\nFor its upcoming second quarter report, Wall Street analysts are anticipating revenue of $28.6 billion, a 112% year-over-year jump. And while that still represents an enormous increase in revenue, it\u2019s not as staggering as the growth the company has seen in its previous quarters. And that could turn off some investors.\nThat\u2019s not to say Nvidia isn\u2019t expected to continue raking in cash, or that Wall Street is down on the company. As of Thursday, 66 analysts had Buy ratings on Nvidia\u2019s stock. Just seven had Hold ratings and only one had a Sell rating.\nIt\u2019s safe to say Wall Street has confidence in the company\u2019s outlook. After all, as UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri pointed out in a recent investor note, semiconductor manufacturer TSMC, which produces Nvidia\u2019s chips, posted strong quarter-over-quarter results in its high-performance computing segment. That should indicate another potentially stellar quarter for Nvidia is in the offing.\nNvidia, unlike software companies, also benefits from the fact that its products have a real tangible benefit for its customers now. Hyperscalers are putting the company\u2019s chips to work as fast as they can to develop and power AI models. But AI-powered software is still in a foggy kind of testing phase. Companies are implementing AI enterprise software, but it\u2019s not as though its impact on their employees\u2019 productivity will skyrocket overnight.\nWhat\u2019s more, experts say it\u2019ll still take years for AI-powered software like Microsoft\u2019s Copilot or Google\u2019s Gemini to truly pay off for business customers. And while those companies are busy iterating on their products, Nvidia will keep on selling them its hardware.\nSo, while the AI trade may have taken a hit over the last month, its biggest winner will continue powering forward.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): An Important AI Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other important AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence has led to a much-needed market rally in the technology industry over the past year. The benchmark S&P 500, dominated by tech giants, is up nearly 20% in the past year. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite is up over 21%. In light of easing inflation numbers and rate cuts, market analysts had forecast a jump in interest around growth options for 2024. However, the AI buzz has served to snowball this ordinary interest into an extraordinary wave of optimism around the whole economy. Although tech stocks have been the biggest beneficiary, there is little doubt that AI will soon penetrate other sectors of the economy, from manufacturing and supply chain, to transportation, entertainment, and retail.\nThere are numbers that illustrate this argument in quantifiable terms. Across the economic spectrum, investments in AI are increasing at a rapid pace. For example, according to a recent report on the AI industry by renowned investment bank Goldman Sachs, established businesses around the world are expected to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years. Investments in AI startups are also booming. So far in 2024, venture capital firms have made around 200 deals with AI firms, investing nearly $22 billion. The average size of a round of funding for AI startups is more than $100 million with an average valuation of more than $1 billion. In contrast, these numbers for non-AI startups are $20 million and $200 million.\nKey players who were early to catch on to the AI trend have leapfrogged competitors. Stocks of companies that make graphics processing units (GPUs), specialized AI chips, and generative AI products have soared. In general, the median returns of AI-linked firms on the S&P 500 are 20% compared to 2% for non-AI stocks. On the NASDAQ Composite, AI firms are responsible for 90% of the overall returns on the border index. Analysts expect these gains to translate into earnings and GDP growth. Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, argues that in the next ten years, AI is likely to automate 25% of all work tasks and raise US productivity by 9% and GDP growth by more than 6%.\nResearch presented in the keynote address to the 2024 EMW Conference by Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management suggests that these gains may be the beginning of a new super cycle for the tech industry, following previous cycles such as PCs in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s that led to the popularity of the cloud. However, investors have more reason to be optimistic about this growth since it compares favorably to cycles of the past. Software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan contend that tech companies seem to be investing in AI products by tying the spending to the revenues, ensuring a safety net that had not existed in previous cycles.\nSince the beginning of the AI wave in early 2023 following the launch of ChatGPT by California-based Open AI, the focus of the industry has shifted from software towards AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure firms have added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since the first quarter of 2023. Before a killer AI application can emerge or large scale AI automation can begin - Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist at MIT, predicts this will take more than a decade - new areas of AI infrastructure are emerging. These include utilities, energy, internet, and industrials (see 20 Industrial Stocks That Are Already Riding the AI Wave). The gains of prominent utility, industrial, energy, and internet firms critical to AI development rival the returns of traditional AI stocks.\nInvestments in energy and utilities are important if this AI potential is to be realized. Goldman analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect the proliferation of AI technology and the accompanying need to maintain data centers to drive an increase in demand for utilities that has not been seen in a generation. It remains to be seen, however, if the pace at which AI is progressing will keep pace with investments in power. This is because the utilities sector is highly regulated and has supply chain constraints that will not be easily overcome. If investments are made at the levels needed, it might still be a few years before their full benefits make their way towards AI firms.\nAll this hullabaloo around AI has investors on edge, with ghosts of previous bubbles haunting their memories. Although comparisons to the past are the surest way of finding your footing in unfamiliar territory, data shows that this may not be the wisest strategy considering present market dynamics. For example, at the height of the dotcom bubble just before the turn of the millennium, some software firms were trading at 132x their earnings. The five-year average for this value in 1999 was only 37x. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks were trading at P/E multiples of around 39x. The five-year average for this last year was 40x, showcasing why AI valuations may not be overextended.\nIndeed, AI firms can target multi-trillion dollar valuations, in line with some of the biggest software and internet firms on the market presently. That is the revolutionary power of AI technology. Over the past decade, tech giants have achieved a scale that few other businesses have before them. By combining billions in users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income, these handful of firms have reached 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. They are category leaders in fields such as smartphones, ecommerce, cloud, and software as a service (SaaS) - all of which AI promises to disrupt - and ahead of competitors in research and development spending. This is why many of these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business models, in hopes of holding onto their thrones.\nSome investors remain concerned about AI firms bullying software companies on the market in the near and long term. A cursory glance at the Price-to-Sale (PS) ratios for software stocks in the past decade reveals that after topping out in 2021, the valuations for SaaS firms are near their all time lows. Some of this pessimism around software can also be attributed to slower earnings growth. Coatue research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS stocks expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% at the peak of the Saas craze. As the future of human-machine interaction moves towards communication in natural language, software firms who adapt to AI changes are more likely to survive than those that do not.\nAs the markets become decoupled from rate hikes, inflation figures go down, and the prospects of a soft landing become brighter, the macro outlook for AI looks favorable as well. The main driver for future S&P 500 growth in terms of earnings remains AI. According to Coatue research, in the next three years, AI-linked stocks will grow at a compound annual rate of almost 20%, beating their non-AI counterparts by nearly 14 percentage points. 40% of the earnings from tech will be accelerated by AI tailwinds in the period. All indicators point towards a brighter future for AI investors in the long term.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI infrastructure stocks with more than 25% gains in 2024 that are also popular among hedge funds. These are the best AI stocks to buy according to the market participants and hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 186\u00a0\nYTD Return as of August 1: 168%\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. In addition to manufacturing world-class GPUs for AI, some of the other AI products of the firm include generative AI, cybersecurity AI, data analytics, conversational AI, and vision AI. The company also markets full stack innovation to turn any organization into an AI enterprise. In the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, the firm beat revenue estimates by a whopping $1.5 billion. The revenue grew by 262% year-on-year, and the non-GAAP earnings per share jumped from $0.88 to $5.16. The firm was able to deliver these numbers as it dominates the GPU market with 88% market share in the category.\nJensen Huang, the COO of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), said during the first quarter earnings call that the industry was going through a major transformation as companies shifted from an existing trillion-dollar traditional data center base to AI data centers. Huang detailed that beyond cloud service providers, generative AI had expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive, and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\nOverall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the most important AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "Associated Press Finance ",
        "Text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Antitrust tensions are heating up in the chipmaking industry. Rivals have accused Wall Street darling Nvidia of abusing its market dominance in selling chips that power artificial intelligence \u2014 and the U.S. Justice Department is now investigating these complaints, technology news site The Information reported.\nAccording to the news outlet, which cited unnamed sources familiar with the discussions, Justice Department officials are looking into concerns Nvidia is potentially cornering the market and pressuring its customers to unfairly retain business. That includes allegations of Nvidia threatening to punish those who buy products from both the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant and its competitors.\nThe Information also reported that U.S. officials had reached out to several Nvidia competitors about the complaints.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment or provide further information when reached by The Associated Press on Friday.\nBut a statement from Nvidia said the company \u201cwins on merit\u201d \u2014 and competes \u201cbased on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws.\"\nWithout directly acknowledging details of The Information\u2019s Thursday report, the company added that it is \u201chappy to provide any information regulators need.\u201d\nNvidia has faced calls for an antitrust investigation from some Democratic lawmakers and progressive groups before. Earlier this week, 10 progressive advocacy groups \u2014 including Demand Progress Education Fund and Tech Oversight Project \u2014 penned a letter to Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter in support of an antitrust investigation into the chipmaker.\n\u201cNvidia is the world\u2019s chip gatekeeper,\u201d the groups wrote, arguing the company had \u201cbullied its way into a prominent investment position\u201d by leveraging scarce supply alongside tactics like blocking customers from doing business with competitors. \u201cSuch a company deserves the most aggressive scrutiny that the Department of Justice can bring to bear.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s has cemented itself as a poster child for the artificial intelligence boom \u2014 and in the process become one of the most valuable companies in the world. In June, the tech giant briefly reached a market value of more than $3.3 trillion.\nSome of that market momentum has stalled a little since \u2014 and any stock climbing to such heights is vulnerable to some investors selling shares to lock in profits. On Friday afternoon, shares for Nvidia were down 3%.\n"

        "Author": "  Sharon Goldman ",
        "Text": "Can chipmaker Nvidia continue its yearslong rocket ride that has made it the second-most valuable public company? Or will it disappoint investors by showing lost momentum?\nThe question has stock watchers on the edge of their seats for Nvidia's quarterly earnings report on Wednesday afternoon. The results will give critical insight into the company's future and clues about the chip industry's financial performance overall.\n\u201cIt's the most important stock in the world right now,\u201d EMJ Capital\u2019s Eric Jackson told CNBC\u2019s Closing Bell about Nvidia last week. Meanwhile, tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities called Nvidia's upcoming report nothing less than \u201cthe most important tech earnings in years.\u201d\nBut Nvidia's results won't necessarily shed light on the broader AI industry and whether the tens of billions of dollars poured into it will ultimately pay off. That\u2019s because the AI boom isn\u2019t just about Nvidia. It\u2019s also about the AI cloud providers, AI startups, and legacy businesses scrambling to make money from AI tools. And that will take time to play out.\nThe primary market for Nvidia's AI chips, called GPUs, are companies training the biggest and most sophisticated AI models. They include OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.\nJust to give a sense of demand for Nvidia chips: Facebook and Instagram parent Meta, on its own, is hoarding nearly 350,000 GPUs, likely worth over $9 billion.\nBut most companies aren't training massive generative AI models, instead using them to spit out information, or inference in industry jargon. While Nvidia sells chips for inference, it built its high-flying business on supplying chips necessary for the complicated work of training models. As the industry evolves, it is inference that is the bigger long-term opportunity, and there is more competition there for Nvidia.\nAlso, corporations usually do their inference work in the cloud. Big cloud providers like Amazon\u2019s AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as AI cloud startups like Coreweave and Groq, are all helping companies power and grow their AI inference efforts. Their future of these providers is largely independent of Nvidia and therefore Nvidia's earnings don't reveal much about their financial performance. Additionally, the AI cloud industry will take time to mature, according to Daniel Newman, principal analyst of Futurum Research. He expects another one to three years of investment in AI infrastructure before the \"Walmart-like use cases\" of generative AI, or obvious successes in industries like retail, travel, and hospitality, are known.\nFor now, there are plenty of companies starting to incorporate AI into their software and operations, Newman said. But when it comes to actually making money and creating viable business models, that's \"still somewhat opaque.\"\nStock watchers will certainly focus on Nvidia for some time and whether its shares can continue to soar. After all, during its remarkable rise in stock price since early 2023, the company's market value has increased nearly 10-fold from $350 billion to $3 trillion this summer.\nBut when it comes to the overall AI landscape, many on Wall Street are wondering whether generative AI can ever really become profitable. Patience is starting to wear thin 18 months after the launch of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, considered the watershed moment for the AI industry.\nDuring Microsoft\u2019s earnings call a few weeks ago, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said that \u201cright now, there\u2019s an industry debate raging around the (capital expenditure) requirements around generative AI.\" Translation: Companies are spending billions on AI infrastructure, including GPUs and cloud, to power the generative AI revolution. But soon enough, their CEOs and boards will expect proof showing their investments are worthwhile.\nNvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings results may indeed fuel more excitement about AI. But it may take several more years before the supersize investment in developing a true generative AI killer app finally produces one.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +1.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.5% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has lost 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.63 per share, indicating a change of +133.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.69 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +106.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.38 indicates a change of +25.8% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $28.24 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +109%. For the current and next fiscal years, $117.82 billion and $152.66 billion estimates indicate +93.4% and +29.6% changes, respectively.\nNvidia reported revenues of $26.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +262.1%. EPS of $0.61 for the same period compares with $0.11 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.02%. The EPS surprise was +11.48%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "While the current buzzword for the hottest tech stocks might be the \"Magnificent Seven,\" that could soon turn into the Terrific Three.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have put a considerable amount of daylight between themselves and the remainder of the Magnificent Seven, which includes Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.\nNvidia, Microsoft, and Apple all have market caps in the range of $3 trillion, and all are among the leaders in the AI revolution in different ways.\nNvidia is the leading chipmaker, building the AI infrastructure that is powering new large language models and applications like ChatGPT. More than any other company, Nvidia has defined the current AI era, and its stock has been the biggest gainer based on market cap.\nMicrosoft has established itself as a leader in AI applications thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft has invested an estimated $13 billion in the ChatGPT maker, and it has forged a close partnership with OpenAI, which has allowed it to deploy ChatGPT across a wide range of products, including Azure, its Office suite, GitHub, and Bing, and the AI-based Copilot, as well as other AI tools already driving meaningful growth for Microsoft.\nFinally, Apple has been somewhat late to the AI party, but the iPhone maker can't be ignored when it comes to a new technology like AI. That's because Apple has an installed base of active devices of 2.2 billion, meaning that it controls the connectivity to AI for billions of users. Apple is also releasing Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI tools like a writing assistant, which is expected to be available to consumers shortly.\nAs the descriptions show, all three of these companies have their own strengths in AI, and all three stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 in the AI era. However, Nvidia has been the clear winner during that time, as the chart below shows.\nNvidia is also the most expensive stock of the three based on its trailing price-to-earnings ratio, which is currently 65, compared to Microsoft at 37 and Apple at 33.\nHowever, Nvidia is also the fastest-growing of the three stocks and is expected to grow revenue by 98% this year, compared to Microsoft at 16% and Apple at 8%.\nBecause of that, Nvidia' forward P/E is much lower, at just 40, bringing it more in line with that of Microsoft and Apple.\nOf the three stocks, Nvidia's future is the most closely tied to AI. Its revenue more than tripled over its last four quarters as it's become the de facto supplier of GPUs and other components needed for AI infrastructure.\nNvidia's also moving fast to release new products and stay on the cutting edge of AI and ahead of the competition. The company just announced a suite of services and computing platforms to help build the next generation of humanoid robots.\nAdditionally, the company recently launched its new Blackwell platform, which can process trillion-parameter large language models at as much as 25 times less cost and energy than Nvidia's previous Hopper architecture.\nNvidia has executed nearly perfectly since the beginning of the generative AI era, and the company looks like a good bet to continue to dominate the market for AI hardware.\nWhile Microsoft and Apple both have their own strengths in AI, they don't have the same level of exposure to AI that Nvidia does, and they haven't demonstrated the same ability to develop new AI technology.\nIf you're bullish on AI, Nvidia looks like the best stock of the three to own today.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\nWall Street stocks are back just shy of new record highs, lapping up the likely start of Federal Reserve easing next month but wary of Wednesday's quarterly update from artificial intelligence behemoth Nvidia.\nThere were three main reasons cited for this month's early \"head fake\" for stocks - a return of jobs-related recession worries, a puncturing of the short-yen, short-volatility trade and creeping doubts about AI overspend and its ultimate promise.\nRecession fears have been doused to some extent by data seen since the July employment report and Fed chair Jerome Powell's clear indication on Friday that \"the time has come\" to ease back on policy rates.\nAnd the speculative yen 'carry trade' and excessively low volatility gauges have returned close to more normal levels.\nBut earnings from $3.1 trillion megacap Nvidia, the second most valuable U.S. stock, are now awaited with bated breath to see if the AI theme is still on track.\nNvidia, whose stock is up more than 150% this year, is expected to report more than a doubling of its second-quarter revenue but the bar is now so high to impress the market, there's some trepidation about guidance ahead.\nThe stock is valued at about 37 times its forward earnings, compared with an average of around 29 for the top six tech companies on the benchmark index that includes the chipmaker.\nResults from Dell and Salesforce this week also add to the tech picture.\nNvidia shares fell back about 2% on Monday in advance of its report, knocking back the main indexes in the process and stopping the S&P500 less than 0.3% from new records.\nBut it was up marginally ahead of Tuesday's bell - as were index futures.\nFacing a heavy week of Treasury debt sales, where some $183 billion of 2-, 5- and 7-year notes go under the hammer, Treasury yields have backed up slightly despite the Fed optimism. First out of the traps on Tuesday is $69 billion of two-year paper.\nIrking Treasury yields additionally has been a pop higher in world crude oil prices this week amid renewed tensions in the Middle East and outages in Libya, although U.S. crude gains have been modest and remain negative year-on-year.\nThe latest test of U.S. economic resilience comes with a readout later on consumer confidence for August, but Friday's release of the Fed-favored PCE inflation gauge probably marks the biggest macro data release of the week.\nThe dollar index recovered marginally from Monday's lowest level in more than year - in line with firmer Treasury yields.\nBut 100 basis points of Fed easing remains in futures prices to the end of the year - implying that markets think at least one of the Fed's three remaining 2024 meetings will deliver a 50bp cut.\nSan Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly on Monday said \"the time is upon us\" to cut interest rates, likely starting with a quarter-percentage point reduction in borrowing costs. Asked if there is anything that could derail a rate cut at the U.S. central bank's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting, Daly told Bloomberg TV that it \"would be hard to imagine at this point.\"\nThe yen slipped back too, however, helping Japan's Nikkei higher.\nChinese mainland stock markets fell back, with news of 100% Canadian tariffs weighing on shares of electric vehicle and steel makers and downbeat comments about domestic demand dragging on e-commerce shares. It was a more mixed picture in Hong Kong, with financials steadying the Hang Seng.\nEuropean stocks were higher, led by miners.\nBHP Group said it will focus on growing its copper business through existing and incoming projects after its failed attempt to buy Anglo American as it reported a better-than-expected 2% rise in annual underlying profit.\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:\n* US August consumer confidence, June home prices, Richmond Fed Aug business surveys, Dallas Fed's Aug service sector survey\n* US Treasury sells $69 billion of 2-year notes\n(Editing by Bernadette Baum)\n"

        "Author": " Hamza Shaban    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nNvidia's (NVDA) boosters keep saying the AI revolution is in its early stages. But a reckoning of Big Tech\u2019s AI spending is already brewing, highlighting a disconnect between the tech\u2019s supposed world-conquering potential and the absence of meaningful returns on investment for companies not named Nvidia. (Fortune reported recently that other Big Tech employees are getting jealous of Nvidians, as they're called.)\nThat snag was on full display during Nvidia\u2019s earnings call. Several analysts asked CEO Jensen Huang about where all that AI money is going and how the company views questions about the industry\u2019s massive capital expenditures and their more speculative returns.\nFor Nvidia, a few other hardware companies, and AI bulls, those returns are already here. But for everyone else in Big Tech and beyond, the results are harder to see.\nCan the hype over AI simultaneously be at the end of its cycle and the beginning of another? It seems to depend on your timeline. And whether investors can accept retreating from exponential gains to merely linear forward progress.\nLooking beyond Nvidia\u2019s earnings stumble \u2014 where the company beat expectations but didn\u2019t pulverize them as in prior blockbuster quarters \u2014 the appetite for AI investments doesn't seem close to being met.\nBut while it\u2019s true the AI trade no longer resembles the meme-coin frenzy of its earlier days, the latest wave of scrutiny over AI spending registers more as a slight recalibration than a paradigm shift.\nTake OpenAI\u2019s latest reported valuation. On the same day Huang was fielding stubborn queries about ROI, the Wall Street Journal reported the AI darling that kicked this whole thing off was in fundraising talks valuing the ChatGPT maker above $100 billion.\nA valuation on par with that of Starbucks (SBUX) and BP (BP) suggests there is enough hullabaloo that we are still far away from an abandonment or pullback. Still, naysayers might say that the financial excitement surrounding OpenAI might not be the most reliable measure of the viability of AI technology.\nMeanwhile, the tech giants are still in investing mode. And for all the chatter of an unsustainable AI moment, of ballooning capex, and of uncertain revenue streams, Big Tech\u2019s CEOs are fully onboard. That goes a long way in explaining Nvidia\u2019s 122% revenue growth.\nBut it also underscores another mismatch between providing AI chips and promising revolutionary, unproven software that relies on those chips. Nvidia's unique growth story is reliant on the tech platforms' AI aspirations.\nDemand for Nvidia\u2019s hardware continues to soar as tech companies fuse their identities and their spending to AI. But at some point, investor gripes over tangible returns may lead to a scale-back that will hurt Nvidia. For now though, Big Tech CEOs have bet so big at the AI casino that it's hard to fathom what would convince them to pack up and stumble home. When you are high enough on the org chart, sunk costs lose meaning. Loss chasing can be mistaken for perseverance.\nNow that all the major AI players have reported, does the tech world's uneven earnings season represent a buying opportunity or a turn to a more exacting appraisal of AI's true worth? Until the investments slow, it will be hard to know.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Title": "Nvidia Dropped to $100 in the Market Sell-Off: Buy, Sell, or Hold?",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino ",
        "Text": "Monday was a brutal day for stocks, as a global sell-off drove the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to their worst performances in almost two years. The reason for the troubles? A weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report last week and concern about the absence of interest rate cuts have investors worried about what's ahead.\nAnd this has weighed on many of the market's best performers this year, including star chip designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock, which soared nearly 150% in the first half of the year, slid 11% in two trading sessions, closing on Monday at about $100. It's impossible to predict whether this general market sell-off will continue or to say with 100% certainty that we've reached a bottom. But in either case, the question is: Should you buy, sell, or hold Nvidia right now? Let's find out.\nFirst, let's talk a bit about Nvidia's stock market performance. The shares not only advanced in the first half, but they'd been soaring for quite some time thanks to the company's triple-digit earnings growth. Nvidia dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, holding 80% share. This is a particularly big deal considering the high demand for AI products today.\nNvidia shares have advanced 2,500% over five years, prompting the company to launch a 10-for-1 stock split back in June to bring them down to earth. A stock split lowers the per-share price through the issuance of more shares to current holders. This doesn't change anything fundamental about a company, but it makes it easier for a broader range of investors to access the shares.\nSince the split, when Nvidia stock opened at about $120, the stock has dropped 17%. Seeing this decline, even prior to the sell-off, investors started wondering whether the stock was starting to lose momentum. On top of this, reports of a potential delay in the launch of Nvidia's new Blackwell chip might be weighing on investors' minds.\nMeanwhile, as mentioned, the overall market has stumbled over the past few days, roiled by concerns about the economy. Technology and growth stocks have led declines, as they're most vulnerable during times of economic troubles. The growth of these players generally depends on customers having the budgets to buy their products and services, and they also rely on borrowing to expand. So it's clear they could be among the first to suffer during tough times.\nNow, let's consider what you should do about Nvidia. Even when a market environment looks uncertain, it's always important to take a long-term view of stocks and your portfolio. History shows that bull markets, bear markets, sell-offs, and any market environment are temporary situations. Highs and lows come and go, but the fantastic news is market growth has always won out. If we look at the major indexes over time, they've always gone on to gain after tough periods.\n^SPX data by YCharts.\nThis means, if a particular company has what it takes to withstand a difficult environment and the company's long-term prospects are solid, you'll want to hang onto that player. And that's why Nvidia makes a great buy or hold today. Plus, if you're buying, you'll pick up the shares at a very reasonable level of 37 times forward-earnings estimates, down from nearly 50 times just a few weeks ago.\nNvidia is a leader in a high-growth market, AI, and this market is in the early stages of its growth story. Analysts predict that today's $200 billion AI market will reach beyond $1 trillion later this decade. Nvidia should benefit thanks to its leadership and its focus on innovation to maintain this position. That's why, during this market sell-off, Nvidia makes a fantastic stock to add to any long-term growth portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $615,516!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "Decoding NVIDIA Corp (NVDA): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Robust Revenue Growth: NVIDIA Corp showcases a significant year-over-year revenue increase, signaling strong market demand.\nImpressive Net Income Performance: The company's net income has seen a substantial rise, reflecting efficient operations and profitability.\nOperational Excellence: NVIDIA Corp's operational income margins have improved, indicating effective cost management and operational efficiency.\nInvestment in Innovation: Continued investment in research and development underscores NVIDIA Corp's commitment to maintaining its technological edge.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nOn August 28, 2024, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), a pioneer in accelerated computing, released its 10-Q filing, providing a window into its financial performance and strategic positioning. This SWOT analysis delves into the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, offering investors a comprehensive overview. The latest financial tables reveal a striking increase in net income to $16,599 million for the three months ended July 28, 2024, compared to $6,188 million for the same period in the previous year. Total comprehensive income followed suit, reaching $16,764 million. Revenue growth was robust, with a gross profit margin of 75.1% for the three months ended July 28, 2024, up from 70.1% the previous year. Operating income also saw a notable uptick to 62.0% of revenue, compared to 50.3% in the prior year. These figures underscore NVIDIA Corp's financial resilience and market leadership.\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: NVIDIA Corp's dominance in the GPU market is fortified by its cutting-edge technology and expansive product portfolio. The company's investment in research and development, which amounted to 10.3% of its revenue for the three months ended July 28, 2024, has yielded a suite of innovative products that cater to a diverse range of applications beyond traditional gaming, including AI, data centers, and autonomous vehicles.\nFinancial Robustness: NVIDIA Corp's financials reflect a strong balance sheet, with net income and comprehensive income showing significant year-over-year growth. The company's operational efficiency is evident in its improved operating income margins, which stand at 62.0% of revenue, highlighting its ability to manage costs effectively while scaling its operations.\nBrand Strength and Customer Loyalty: NVIDIA Corp's brand is synonymous with high-performance computing, which has cultivated a loyal customer base. The company's GPUs are the preferred choice for gamers, data scientists, and AI researchers, which is a testament to the trust and reliability associated with the NVIDIA brand.\nDependence on the Semiconductor Supply Chain: NVIDIA Corp's reliance on third-party manufacturers for chip production exposes it to risks associated with supply chain disruptions. The semiconductor industry is known for its cyclical nature and supply constraints, which can lead to mismatches between supply and demand, affecting NVIDIA's ability to meet customer needs promptly.\nHigh Competition in Core Markets: The GPU market is highly competitive, with several players vying for market share. NVIDIA Corp faces stiff competition from established companies and new entrants, which could pressure margins and market share if not strategically managed.\nComplex Product Transitions: NVIDIA Corp's rapid innovation pace necessitates frequent product transitions, which can be complex and resource-intensive. Managing supply and demand during these transitions is challenging and could lead to inventory imbalances or missed market opportunities.\nExpansion into AI and Data Centers: The burgeoning field of AI presents significant growth opportunities for NVIDIA Corp. The company's GPUs and software platforms are well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI applications, particularly in data centers where high-performance computing is crucial.\nStrategic Partnerships and Collaborations: NVIDIA Corp can leverage strategic partnerships to expand its market reach and enhance its product offerings. Collaborations with industry leaders and participation in consortiums can drive innovation and open new revenue streams.\nEmerging Markets and Applications: NVIDIA Corp can tap into emerging markets and applications, such as autonomous vehicles and the Internet of Things (IoT), where its GPU technology can play a pivotal role. Diversifying its application portfolio can reduce reliance on traditional markets and drive long-term growth.\nGeopolitical and Economic Uncertainties: Global economic and geopolitical developments can have direct and indirect impacts on NVIDIA Corp's operations. Macroeconomic factors such as trade tensions, tariffs, and currency fluctuations can affect the company's supply chain, manufacturing costs, and overall financial performance.\nTechnological Disruption: The fast-paced nature of the technology sector means that NVIDIA Corp must continuously innovate to stay ahead. Disruptive technologies or shifts in customer preferences could render existing products obsolete and impact the company's market position.\nRegulatory and Legal Challenges: NVIDIA Corp operates in a highly regulated industry, and changes in laws, regulations, or government policies, such as export controls or usage restrictions, can affect its business operations and competitive landscape.\nIn conclusion, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) exhibits a robust financial foundation and a strong market position, driven by its commitment to innovation and a broad product portfolio. However, the company must navigate the complexities of the semiconductor supply chain, intense competition, and rapid product transitions. Opportunities in AI, data centers, and emerging markets offer promising avenues for growth, while geopolitical uncertainties, technological disruptions, and regulatory challenges pose potential risks. NVIDIA Corp's strategic initiatives and forward-looking strategies will be pivotal in leveraging its strengths and opportunities to mitigate weaknesses and threats, ensuring sustained success in the dynamic tech landscape.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Prediction: Nvidia Will Jump Over 20% By the End of 2024 After Its Big Sell-Off",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.\nRegular viewers of ABC's Wide World of Sports heard the late Jim McKay utter those words for decades. While McKay referred to athletes, his phrase can also apply to stocks -- including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nThroughout much of the past few years, Nvidia has enjoyed \"the thrill of victory.\" Its shares skyrocketed along with the demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). More recently, though, Nvidia has tasted \"the agony of defeat\" somewhat with its stock sinking.\nHowever, I don't think Nvidia will have this taste in its mouth for long. I predict Nvidia stock will jump by more than 20% by the end of 2024 after its big sell-off.\nBefore I explain the rationale behind my prediction, let's first look at the factors behind Nvidia's steep decline. Some are specific to the company but not all of them.\nIn July, Bloomberg News reported that the Biden administration was considering imposing further restrictions on exports of semiconductor equipment to China. Former President Donald Trump also told Bloomberg Businessweek in an interview that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it. Both stories caused chip stocks to fall.\nDisappointing July employment numbers in a report released on Aug. 2 stoked fears of a potential U.S. recession. Nvidia's shares fell as this news weighed on the broader stock market.\nThe market was rattled even more by the Bank of Japan raising interest rates. This move had a global impact because some investors had borrowed money in Japan to take advantage of low rates and then invested the borrowed money in U.S. stocks (including Nvidia) in what's called a \"carry trade.\"\nAround the same time, news broke that Nvidia's launch of chips based on its new Blackwell architecture could be delayed by three months. The Information, a website focused on the technology sector, reported that Nvidia found a design flaw that caused the delay.\nWhy do I predict Nvidia stock will rebound in the wake of all of this bad news? For one thing, the news isn't as bad as it might seem at first glance.\nSo far, the Biden administration hasn't placed any further restrictions on exports to China. It's unclear if Nvidia would be impacted even if changes are implemented. The disappointing July jobs report was followed by lower-than-expected weekly jobless claims a few days later, easing concerns about a recession.\nJ.P. Morgan analysts think that roughly 75% of the carry trades impacted by the rate hike in Japan have been unwound. In other words, the worst is over.\nAny delay in shipping the new Blackwell chips would hurt Nvidia's sales growth. The good news is that the impact would only be temporary.\nImportantly, Nvidia is scheduled to provide its fiscal 2025 Q2 update on Aug. 28. I expect the company will again handily beat Wall Street estimates. I also think it's likely that Nvidia will give a firm date for when Blackwell shipments will begin that isn't too far into the future. The Q2 update could (and I think will) clear the deck for Nvidia's shares to resume their upward climb.\nNvidia's guidance could also reassure investors. Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms said in their recent quarterly updates that they plan to spend heavily on AI infrastructure. That should translate to higher sales for Nvidia.\nFinally, many analysts and economists expect the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. I do too. And I think it's quite possible this rate cut could be a catalyst for the stock market and help push Nvidia's shares higher.\nI'm assuming that the U.S. economy will remain relatively strong. But should the economy stumble (and especially if there are signs that a recession is beginning), all bets are off. If this happens, Nvidia stock probably won't rise 20% or more by year-end as I predict.\nHowever, the latest weekly jobless claims and the increased likelihood of rate cuts in the near future bolster my confidence. I stand by my prediction about Nvidia. We'll find out in a few months if I'm right.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Marco Quiroz-Gutierrez ",
        "Text": "Nvidia\u2019s skyrocketing stock has made its employees so rich they\u2019ll tolerate pretty much anything\u2014even its demanding and sometimes unhealthy work culture.\nThe company\u2019s shares have shot up more than 3,000% since the start of 2019, making many of its employees millionaires. But even though they may be wealthy, workers are often too busy at the office to enjoy it, 10 anonymous current and former employees told Bloomberg. Still, few are willing to leave if it means putting their vested shares at stake.\nOne former employee who worked in technical support for enterprise clients and left in May said he often worked seven days a week, and frequently ended his work day at 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. Other workers, especially those in the engineering department, worked even later, he added. At times, the pressure even led to yelling fights during meetings, the former employee said. In the marketing department, another former employee who left in 2022 said fighting and shouting was also common in the 30-plus-person meetings she attended seven to 10 times per day.\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment.\nPart of the demanding work culture comes from longtime CEO Jensen Huang, who has previously acknowledged he\u2019s not easy to work for. In an interview with 60 Minutes in April, Huang said working at Nvidia shouldn\u2019t be easy, anyway.\n\u201cIf you want to do extraordinary things, it shouldn\u2019t be easy,\u201d he said at the time.\nYet despite the pressures of working at Nvidia, employees leave the company at a much lower rate than is common in the industry. In 2023, the company had a 2.7% turnover rate, compared to 17.7% in the semiconductor industry at large, according to Nvidia\u2019s Sustainability Report for fiscal year 2024.\nPart of why employees don\u2019t leave the company is the opportunity to work on the cutting edge of tech, for the leader of the AI chips industry. But another motivation is hanging on until stock grants vest, which at Nvidia typically happens over a four-year period. Those who leave sooner could miss out on a big payday.\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nNvidia\u2019s massive stock rally has already made its executives some of the wealthiest in the tech industry. With about 3.5% ownership of the company, Huang is the world\u2019s 12th-wealthiest person, with a net worth of $111 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. CFO Colette Kress\u2019s $757.8 million worth of Nvidia stock puts her above counterparts at Intel and AMD, whose holdings don\u2019t exceed $10 million, according to Bloomberg.\nThrough Nvidia\u2019s employee stock purchase plan, employees can contribute up to 15% of their salary to buy company shares at a 15% discount. One mid-level employee who bought in for 18 years reportedly retired with shares worth $62 million, according to Barron\u2019s senior technology editor Tae Kim.\nAll that stock wealth makes for an unusual dynamic in the workplace, even among employees outside of the C-suite. A former engineering employee who left in June told Bloomberg that in 2023 and into this year it was common to hear talk about new vacation homes and see colleagues scrolling Zillow at work.\nAt Nvidia\u2019s Santa Clara, Calif., office, Porsches, Corvettes, and Lamborghinis line the parking lot. Some are even lime-green\u2014a tribute to the logo of the company that made them possible.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Morning Bid: Nvidia 'beats' as expected, but fallout limited",
        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\nAfter all that, Nvidia beat expectations - which has become \"expected\" - and the stock retreated about 5%. This is still August, after all.\nTo be fair, the negative market reception to the artificial intelligence pacesetter's quarterly results overnight was typical of the reaction to other ostensible \"beats\" in the sector in this earnings season. These stocks are expensive, have come a long way in a short space of time and the bar to impress is now sky high.\nAnd while the hoopla around the $3.1 trillion-valued Nvidia's earnings this week reflects long-standing concerns about over-concentration of the market on the fortunes of a handful of companies, the wider disturbance has been limited.\nThere were some clouds on the horizon of the megacap chip designer, but the main concern was simply that the \"beat\" wasn't as big as it has been recently. For all the reasonable concerns, this was far from a fatal blow to the AI theme.\nSpin out to other related readouts and the sky still looks pretty clear. Salesforce beat Wall Street expectations on revenue and profit too amid higher spending on its enterprise cloud products - sending its shares up 3% in extended trading.\nSuper Micro Computer did tumble almost 20% on Wednesday - but that was after the AI server maker said it would delay the filing of its annual report a day after Hindenburg Research disclosed a short position in the company.\nAnd away from the Big Tech and AI world, the market value of billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway surpassed $1 trillion for the first time with a modest 1% gain in its class B stocks.\nThe upshot ahead of Thursday's bell? U.S. stock futures were steady to higher after the indexes ebbed marginally in the previous session.\nATTENTION BACK ON MACRO WORLD\nAttention now switches back to the macro world, with the significant backdrop of a likely first Federal Reserve rate cut in the cycle next month.\nEven hawkish Atlanta Fed boss Raphael Bostic said overnight that it may be \"time to move\", even though he retained the right to see some more data before making up his mind.\nOn that score the next ingredients come later today with another critical health check on the labor market and weekly jobless claims, with the Fed's favored PCE inflation gauge due out tomorrow.\nA punchy 100 basis points of Fed easing is still priced into the futures market by year-end - so perhaps there's some room to row that back, regardless of thinking on the first move in September.\nDespite a heavy week of Treasury debt sales, that Fed picture remains a balm for the bond market. Two-year yields recorded their lowest New York close in more than a year on Wednesday and remained subdued at 3.86% first thing today, and 10-year yields slipped back too.\nThe global inflation picture still appears benign.\nOil prices remain under wraps even against unsettling supply threats and continue to register year-on-year losses of up to 7%. U.S. retail gasoline prices are down more than 14% on this time last year, the deepest annual loss in 12 months.\nInflation fell in six important German states in August due to lower energy prices, suggesting Germany's national inflation rate could decline noticeably this month.\nEconomists polled by Reuters forecast a harmonised national inflation rate in Germany - the euro zone's largest economy - of 2.3% in August, down from 2.6% the previous month. But the readout from the states means than could now come in even lower.\nWith markets already pricing a second interest rate cut this year from the European Central Bank even before the Fed meets next month, the euro fell back sharply on Thursday and lifted the dollar index more broadly.\nJust as important, money markets now see a 70% chance of third ECB cut in October.\nAnd in China, the offshore yuan surged to its strongest level in more than three weeks despite mainland stocks there ending in the red again.\nUBS on Wednesday cut its 2024 economic growth forecast for China to 4.6% from 4.9%, as it expects weaker property activity to have bigger than previously assumed drag on the overall economy.\nBut in some sign of detente between the world's two biggest economic powers, U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Thursday and wrapped up three days of wide-ranging talks aimed at easing tensions between the two ahead of November's U.S. election.\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:\n* US Q2 GDP revision, weekly jobless claims, July trade balance, July wholesale/retail inventories, July pending home sales; Canada Q2 current account\n* Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks\n* US corporate earnings: Best Buy, Dollar General, Ulta Beauty, Lululemon, Athletica, Autodesk, Campbell Soup, Brown-Forman, MongoDB\n* US Treasury sells $44 billion of 7-year notes, $85 billion of 4-week bills, $80 billion of 8-week bills\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by XXXX; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n"

        "Text": "Wall Street\u2019s darling semiconductor stock NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has witnessed a meteoric rise in the last few years, banking on the growing interest in cryptocurrency and the advent of artificial intelligence (AI).\nNVIDIA\u2019s graphic processing units (GPUs) are applied to train large language models, the mainstay of generative AI. Big cloud providers are thus grabbing several of NVIDIA\u2019s chips, which helped its market cap jump from around $424 billion to $3.1 trillion in the past two years.\nIn 2023, NVIDIA stock rallied more than 200%. NVIDIA\u2019s shares have already outperformed the Semiconductor - General industry this year (+159.1% vs +109.1%).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSuch a steep rise in share prices has led NVIDIA to announce a 10-for-1 stock split. After all, $1,000 invested at the beginning of the year would be worth $1,591 today.\nThe launch of the next-generation Blackwell AI chips scheduled later this year, and the growing gaming and industrial metaverse market are expected to help the NVIDIA stock scale further upward. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 106.9% (read more: Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold NVIDIA Stock Before Q2 Earnings?).\nNVIDIA is now the second largest company worldwide, behind Apple Inc. AAPL. Investors have set their sights on finding the next NVIDIA stock that has a growing interest in AI and offers a highly scalable business. Two of the prominent names are Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM. Here\u2019s why \u2013\nSuper Micro is giving stiff competition to established players in the AI server market like Dell Technologies Inc. DELL. The company has been able to make the most of the unquenchable demand for AI servers, a market that is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 18% from the current year to 2032, per Global Market Insights.\nSuper Micro manufactures unfaltering AI servers required to mount AI chips that semiconductor companies sell. Super Micro recorded $14.94 billion in sales in fiscal 2024, up 110% year over year.\nSuper Micro accounts for only 10% of the AI server market share, a tell-tale sign that it has more room to expand its business. Bank of America Corporation BAC has already projected Super Micro\u2019s share in the AI server market to jump to 17% in the next three years.\nSuper Micro\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter and year is 117.2% and 51.7%, respectively. Eminent brokerage companies have also increased the average short-term price target of SMCI by 65% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $562.51. Brokers have set the highest price target at $1,500, an upside of 166.7%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBased in Taiwan\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC is a semiconductor manufacturing foundry that has seen huge gains from the global AI boom.\nTSMC expects a growing demand for its cutting-edge chips as more companies, such as Apple, begin to install AI features in smartphones. TSMC\u2019s manufacturing competence is needed for GPUs to be operative. These GPUs form an integral part of data centers where huge data are stored. These data are required for AI applications like Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT, whose demand has skyrocketed. So, in a way, TSMC\u2019s business is expected to scale up from the increase in demand for AI applications.\nTSMC\u2019s estimated earnings growth rate for the current quarter and year is 33.3% and 24.5%, respectively. Also, notable brokerage firms have jacked up the average short-term price target of TSM by 21.1% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $169.07. Brokers\u2019 highest price target is $250, an upside of 47.9%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSuper Micro and TSMC\u2019s shares have soared this year, gaining 92% and 63.3%, respectively.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, both SMCI and TSM\u2019s stock are less expensive than the NVDA stock, which has given them a competitive edge over the largest semiconductor player. This is because, per the price/earnings ratio, SMCI and TSM stock presently trades at 16.3X and 26.4X forward earnings, respectively. But, NVDA\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 47.6X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSMCI and TSM stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. NVDA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Traditional data processing tools struggle to handle the scale and complexity of modern data sets, which have been expanding rapidly due to the surge in mobile data traffic, cloud computing, and the integration of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). These factors have contributed to the rise of big data as a critical asset for businesses across industries. As the data landscape evolves, advanced analytics tools such as predictive analytics and data mining have become essential for extracting valuable insights from vast datasets.\nThe rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a surge in connected devices, generating enormous amounts of data that necessitate advanced big data solutions for effective processing and analysis. Cloud computing enhances the big data market by offering scalable and cost-efficient storage and processing capabilities, enabling businesses to handle large data volumes with ease. Technological advancements in big data are continually enhancing the management and analysis of vast datasets, making these processes more accessible and practical. This progress supports the growing trend of data-driven decision-making, where companies increasingly rely on data insights to make informed choices, optimize operations, and secure a competitive edge. Additionally, big data analytics helps organizations uncover hidden patterns and customer trends, fostering innovation and allowing for the development of products and services that adapt to evolving market demands, underscoring the vital role of big data in today\u2019s competitive landscape.\nInvestment in big data technologies is also driven by stringent data privacy and security regulations. Compliance with laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S. is becoming mandatory for businesses. These regulations require robust data handling practices, pushing companies to implement advanced big data solutions that ensure data privacy and security. Enhanced measures such as secure storage and data privacy protocols build trust with consumers and stakeholders. Moreover, the need for effective data governance frameworks is accelerating the adoption of sophisticated big data technologies. These solutions facilitate comprehensive data management, including tracking data lineage, maintaining data integrity, and conducting regular audits. Emphasis is placed on integrating encryption, anonymization, and real-time monitoring tools to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. Continuous investment in big data technologies is crucial for businesses to meet evolving compliance requirements, thereby driving the market\u2019s growth.\nAccording to a report by Verified Market Reserach, North America is projected to remain a leader in the big data market, driven by key industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In the financial sector, Big Data analytics plays a crucial role for banks, investment firms, and insurance companies by providing deeper insights into customer behavior, detecting fraudulent activities, and evaluating risk. By analyzing extensive data sets, including transaction histories, market trends, and customer demographics, financial institutions can uncover patterns and anomalies that aid in making informed decisions and managing risks. Predictive analytics models further enhance market trend forecasts, optimize investment strategies, and improve portfolio management, contributing to greater profitability and competitive edge in the financial sector.\nIn healthcare, Big Data analytics significantly improves patient care, reduces costs, and advances medical research. Healthcare providers use Big Data to analyze electronic health records (EHRs), medical imaging, and genomic data to tailor treatment plans, diagnose diseases with greater precision, and predict patient outcomes. Population health analytics also helps healthcare organizations identify high-risk groups, allocate resources more effectively, and implement preventive measures. Additionally, the integration of big data into healthcare systems supports real-time monitoring of patient health metrics, allowing for timely interventions and better overall outcomes. Pharmaceutical companies benefit from big data by accelerating drug discovery, refining clinical trials, and creating personalized medicines, driving innovation and progress in medical science.\nWith such a robust outlook for the big data market, investors are keenly eyeing companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. In this article, we will explore the best big data stocks to buy now, focusing on companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on the immense growth opportunities within this dynamic sector.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target Upside: 5.40%\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $131.31\u00a0\nNumber ten on our list of ten best big data stocks to buy now is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company makes chips that are used to facilitate big data use cases. The average analyst price target for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is $131.31, indicating a potential upside of 5.40% as of August 16. Analysts consider NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) a strong buy ahead of its August 28 earnings report. Despite a 35% drop, the stock rebounded and may surge again. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a leader in the AI market, stands to benefit from the sector\u2019s rapid growth, projected to expand from $184 billion in 2024 to $826 billion by 2030. Analysts believe the company\u2019s current 78% gross margin may decline due to competition, but this isn\u2019t an immediate concern. With a forward P/E ratio of around 40 for fiscal 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued earnings growth could drive its stock higher, making it a solid long-term buy despite potential risks.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).\u201d\nOverall NVDA ranks 10th on our list of the best big data stock to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "One can't compile a list of history's most successful stocks without including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Since the company's initial public offering (IPO) in 1999, the stock has risen nearly 300,000%! The majority of that gain occurred over the last 10 years as the advent of cloud computing increased the importance of Nvidia's GPUs.\nHowever, what truly supercharged the stock was the company's dominance in AI chips. The demand for such chips has made Nvidia the leading chip company, leading to a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this year. When combining that with previous splits, even Nvidia's smallest shareholders would own a significant position today.\nInvestors who bought one share of Nvidia stock at the IPO would have 480 shares today. The company's stock has split 2-for-1 three times between 2000 and 2006 and 3-for-2 in 2007. No other splits occurred until the pandemic, when demand for Nvidia's GPUs took shares higher, prompting a 4-for-1 split. The AI chip revolution led shares to a massive surge between late 2022 and today, leading to the aforementioned 10-for-1 split.\nThe financial gains were huge. One share at the IPO cost $12 before the six splits. Today, 480 shares hold a value of around $58,000. Thus, even holding a token amount of Nvidia in 1999 would have brought eye-popping returns.\nUltimately, Nvidia shows how holding even one share can bring considerable share growth through splits.\nInvestors shouldn't expect one share of their growth stocks to become 480 shares. Nonetheless, if a company consistently grows revenue and profits by double digits, it's likely to split every few years.\nIt takes only seven 2-for-1 splits for one share to grow to 128 shares, or just two 10-for-1 splits to turn one share into 100. Such examples show how investing in a successful growth stock early on can lead to exponential share gains over time.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Affan Mir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Beginner Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other beginner stocks.\nWhile investing in the stock market carries risk, the US stock market is generally considered a safe place to invest. It has a long history of growth and has consistently recovered from downturns, including major recessions and financial crises.\nOver the last four to five years, the market has been hit by several unexpected downturns, due to a global pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, among other things, that crippled the global economy. However, the US broader market recovered swiftly and has been performing well since 2023. It is nearly 19% up year-to-date, as of August 23.\nNevertheless, it is still a complicated place for beginners and they should consider investing in shares of well-established companies with a history of stable performance and reliability. These stocks typically belong to large, financially sound companies that operate in diverse industries, such as technology, consumer goods, and healthcare.\nAdditionally, beginners can also look into index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track major market indices like the S&P 500. These options offer diversification, which reduces the risk associated with investing in individual stocks while still providing exposure to the broader market's potential gains. Investing in such well-established and diversified assets can help beginners build confidence and knowledge in the stock market. For such ETFs, you can check out our article on the best large-cap growth ETFs.\nOn August 16, Melissa Minkow, director of retail strategy at CI&T, discussed the latest trends in U.S. consumer spending in a CNBC interview. Despite concerns about a potential recession, Minkow believes we might have avoided one. She pointed out that although consumers may feel like they are in a recession, their spending habits show otherwise. They continue to spend, especially when presented with discounts. Retailers have adapted by offering more targeted promotions this year, which has helped maintain consumer spending despite previous challenges like the pandemic and supply chain issues.\nMinkow also noted that the effectiveness of promotions can vary across sectors. For example, quick-service restaurants like McDonald's and Starbucks haven\u2019t seen the same benefits from discounts as other retailers, partly because consumers may opt for more cost-effective alternatives like home-cooked meals. Additionally, brands that are already positioned as discount options might not see as much impact from promotions. However, retailers who offer significant discounts on desirable items can attract cost-conscious shoppers and increase sales volume, potentially offsetting the impact on profit margins.\nFor beginner investors in the stock market, the current retail sector dynamics offer both opportunities and challenges. The resilience of consumer spending, even in the face of economic uncertainty, suggests that certain sectors and companies could continue to perform well, especially those that effectively use promotions to drive sales. Retailers offering targeted discounts on popular items may attract more customers, boosting their sales volumes, which could lead to positive stock performance.\nHowever, beginner investors should also be cautious. Not all companies benefit equally from promotions, as seen with the restaurant and food segment, where discounts haven\u2019t significantly improved earnings. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific business models and market positioning of companies before investing.\nThe U.S. stocks have seen a significant surge over the last few quarters, which are mainly driven by strong economic data and optimism about a potential soft landing for the U.S. economy. However, experts remain cautious as we discussed in our best defensive stocks article.\nIn the article, we discussed the J.P. Morgan report that noted the market's heavy reliance on large, high-quality tech and AI companies, and it warned that maintaining this momentum could be challenging due to high valuations and potential market volatility. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\u201cAccording to a July report by J.P Morgan, recent market trends have benefited large, high-quality companies, especially in tech and AI, which have resulted in high market concentration. However, maintaining this momentum in the second half of 2024 could be difficult due to high valuations and investor positioning. The report says that while U.S. market volatility is currently low, it could rise if conditions change.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used stock screeners to identify large to mega-cap stocks with a revenue compound annual growth rate of at least 5% over the last 10 years. The companies we chose are well-known, well-established, fundamentally strong, and some also pay regular dividends. We listed the companies in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter of 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem in a meeting at Denny's diner in San Jose, the company started with a vision to revolutionize computing through graphics-based processing. Despite early struggles, including the failure of its first graphics accelerator and a near brush with bankruptcy, the company persevered. As of 2024, it is the most dominant player in the GPU market.\nThe company\u2019s strategic decisions to diversify into areas like AI, data centers, and autonomous vehicles have paid off immensely. Nvidia's CUDA software platform, introduced in the mid-2000s, played a pivotal role in establishing the company as a leader in high-performance computing and AI.\nDespite some setbacks, NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth trajectory has been remarkable, especially after the Gen AI trend that started with the launch of ChatGPT. The company reached a valuation of over $3 trillion in 2024 and briefly became the most valuable publicly traded company.\nOn August 22, The Fly reported that Citi maintained a Buy rating on NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a price target of $150 in anticipation of the company's earnings report for the July quarter, scheduled for August 28. Citi analysts believe that the company could exceed Wall Street\u2019s revenue projections by about $1 billion, though this would be less than the $2 billion revenue beat it achieved in the previous four quarters. This lower-than-expected beat is attributed to concerns about supply chain issues and delays related to the company's Blackwell chip series.\nCiti expects that after the earnings report, analysts will likely revise their revenue forecasts upward for NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) upcoming quarters. The firm also anticipates that the company will address Blackwell-related concerns, providing a positive outlook for 2025. This reassurance is expected to boost investor confidence and potentially push the company\u2019s stock to reach a new 52-week high.\nAs of the second quarter, 179 hedge funds held NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares worth $53.67 billion. Fisher Asset Management is the company\u2019s most significant shareholder with 93.437 million shares worth $11.54 billion, as of June 30.\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIf Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA\u2019s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the best beginner stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "With Its Blackwell Chips Delayed, Should Investors Delay Buying Nvidia Stock?",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "While there has been a lot of excitement surrounding the launch of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) latest chips based on its new Blackwell architecture, both customers and investors apparently will need to wait a bit longer. According to reports, the shipment of the chips will be delayed, although by how long remains to be seen.\nGiven the strong demand that was expected for the chips, let's take a closer look at the issue and the impact it may have on the stock.\nAs first reported by the tech publication website The Information, a design flaw in its Blackwell B200 chip was found \"unusually late\" in the production process. The issue is believed to stem from the company being one of the first to use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer's new CoWoS-L packaging technology (\"Chip on Wafer on Substrate with a Local silicon interconnect,\" if you're curious) and the placement of the bridge dies connecting two graphics processing units (GPUs) being less than perfect.\nAs a result, Nvidia has apparently decided to revamp the design of its Blackwell GPUs, which is expected to delay the start of shipments by three months or more, according to some reports. Customers and partners have indirectly confirmed the delays. Meta Platforms says it doesn't expect to receive Blackwell GPUs this year, while Super Micro Computer executives say they don't expect any real volumes from Blackwell until the March quarter.\nAlphabet, Microsoft, and Meta all have huge Blackwell orders worth \"tens of billions of dollars\" that they are looking to get filled, according to The Information. Meanwhile, it was reported earlier this year that Amazon was moving its Nvidia AI accelerator orders from Hopper to Blackwell.\nWhile Hopper orders will likely help fill some of the void resulting from the Blackwell delay, the risk is that there is an air pocket if these customers just wait on their large orders.\nUBS analysts, however, have come out and said that, after speaking to Nvidia customers, the firm expects the chip delay to only be between four to six weeks and that the delay will be \"invisible\" to most customers. This is much shorter than the initial delay that was reported, which has helped lift the stock off its recent lows.\nThe length of the delay for Blackwell will likely have a big impact on Nvidia in the short term. A short delay will likely be good for the stock with hardly any impact on its 2025 results, while a delay of three months or more would be looked upon unfavorably, especially after the idea of a shorter delay has already been floated by a Wall Street analyst.\nThere also is the question of whether the design flaw could cause a chip failure or whether it was just leading to less-than-expected production yields. Either way, it appears that the company's decision to delay production of the chip and fix any issues is a smart move.\nLonger term, the bigger question surrounding the chip issues is whether Nvidia has sped up its development timeline too quickly. The company has cut its planned development cycle for new chip architectures from two years to one. This should keep demand and prices high, but it's also an aggressive schedule with limited room for error or delays. Being at the forefront of new technology and delivering mass production of your products are two separate things that may not always coincide in the future as well. So these are some risks to consider.\nThat said, with a number of customers having absolutely huge orders for its chips, demand is not an issue for Nvidia. Customers are currently more concerned about falling behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race than overbuilding capacity. As large language models (LLMs) become more advanced, they will need more and more computing power, which means more GPUs will be needed. For example, Meta said its Llama 4 LLM will likely need 10 times the computing power of its previous version to train.\nAnd that right there is the biggest reason to own Nvidia. With a dominant market position in the GPU space, Nvidia will continue to be the biggest beneficiary of the continued push for more computing power.\nAt the same time, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earning (P/E) ratio of about 30 times based on 2025 analyst estimates. For a company with the growth and long-term prospects of Nvidia, that valuation is quite attractive.\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts.\nSo while there are risks associated with the Blackwell delay, long-term investors can still look to buy Nvidia at current levels.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Among Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs' Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks: Top 20 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Goldman Sachs' other hedge fund stock picks.\nThe close of August has marked a highly awaited paradigm shift on Wall Street that investors have been wishing for months. This shift comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally admitted that the time for interest rate cuts had come. Investors rejoiced and the flagship S&P index gained 1.15% while the Dow's blue chip stock index added 1.14% to its value.\nBefore the Fed chair's remarks, investment bank Goldman Sachs had already taken a detailed look at the implications of interest rate cuts on the stock market. In a podcast, the bank's trading strategy head Josh Schiffrin started by explaining that the prospect of the Fed reducing rates was linked \"very closely to the performance of short-term bonds.\" He however added that it's \"really been bonds that have been responsive, where the story has been quite clear,\" pointing out that \"the stock market has been range bound and choppy with a fair amount of rotation between different sectors\" which leads to index level moves being \"muted.\" This makes sense when we consider the Dow and S&P's movements following Powell's latest comments, as the one percentage point gain for each indicated that investors were well prepared for rate cuts even before the Fed Chair took the stand.\nSpeaking of the flagship S&P index, GS' head of American Equity Sales Trading John Flood shared some insights at the June close. Starting off by highlighting the drives of the index's performance during the first half of the year, Flood outlined that when it came to hedge funds, artificial intelligence and GLP-1 were the two key trends that had driven index returns. He described it as \"a long momentum trade\" with \"both cohorts\" of the hedge fund side, namely the \"systemic and fundamental long-short\" fully involved in trading.\nThe Goldman equity head also added that retail investors were finally back as well, and they were focused on \"focused on the ten biggest stocks in the world.\" You can see which companies these might be by reading 20 Largest Companies in the World by Market Cap in 2024. One key concern among investors and analysts alike this year has been a bifurcation in market returns that has seen only the best performers yield most of the rewards. This was also on the mind of analysts from another well known Wall Street bank, who added that it created an opportunity for further profits. Flood shared that while five stocks accounted for \"60% of S&P 500's return year to date,\" this sharp divide did not make him uncomfortable.\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\nThe investor flood of optimism surrounding AI, which has pushed the shares of the top AI GPU designer in the world to post an unbelievable 321,150% in all time returns, has also led to worries that the market might be witnessing another period akin to the ill fated dotcom era of the 1990s. When asked whether this period reminded him of that time, Flood replied that his firm felt \"a little bit more like 1995 than 1999. And 1995 clearly was a very positive year for the stock market and a positive run,\" particularly since \"valuations and earnings from market leaders are way friendlier today than they were in 1999.\" Concluding by sharing that he felt \"very bullish\" the analyst also forecast his estimate for the flagship S&P. His estimate? Well, Flood believes that \"you could see S&P 500 trade well north of 6,000 this year as the biggest get bigger and we continue to just see a little bit of a news vacuum into the elections right now.\"\nThe bit about market bifurcation between big and small companies was also on the mind of GS' senior US portfolio strategist Ben Snider. He commented on the jump in small cap stocks in July when they gained as much as 2% while other indexes lost up to 1.98% due to investors positioning themselves for potential interest rate cuts. Snider explained that small cap stocks tend to take on more debt, and lower rates coupled with their lower market values lead to big gains. According to him \"if just 1% of assets comes out of the S&P 500 and flows into, for example, the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index, that 1% of S&P 500 market cap would represent more than 15% of Russell 2000 market cap.\" Coming back to AI, the Goldman strategist has a tip for those who might be worried that the hype surrounding AI might be more than the technology's ability to generate money for the firms that plan to plow a trillion dollars into it. He shared that as opposed to the market cap weighted benchmark S&P, it might be prudent to invest in the equal weight variant \"if you are concerned about the degree of concentration or AI investment.\"\nSpeaking of AI, GS was also out with a detailed report in July which analyzed the year to date returns of different AI sectors. The AI stack, broadly speaking, is made up of four categories of firms. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid and moving upwards, these are chip manufacturers and designers, those that provide AI capacity like server farms, firms that sell AI products, and finally, companies that will see the largest gains from the ubiquitous or near ubiquitous adaptation of AI. As per GS, the year to date returns of these four sectors as of late July were 139% (represented only by the top AI GPU stock), 22%, -2%, and 2% respectively. One of the strongest performers within the AI infrastructure segment is utilities, and there's further room ahead as analyst Ryan Hammond believes that \"after adjusting valuations for the improvement in long- term EPS growth expectations that the sector has experienced, Utilities\u2019 PEG (P/E to long term growth (LTG)) ratio is 2x, well below the historical average of 3x.\"\nSo, with GS taking a broad view of the market, we decided to see which hedge fund stocks the bank is a fan of.\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs' top hedge fund stocks, we ranked the bank's list of stocks with the number of hedge funds that, according to its data, had the stock as a top ten holding.\nWe also mentioned the total number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks as per Insider Monkey's data. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 179\nGS' Number Of Funds: 41\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's leading GPU designer. It provides the chips for enterprise computing (including AI), consumer gaming, assisted driving, and other use cases. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPU performance boosted by its design strengths has pushed it right to the top of the AI hardware supply chain. The firm's GPUs are the most highly sought products in the market, and they provide NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with significant pricing power. At the same time, all eyes remain on the firm for consistent upgrades, and it might struggle if it fails to launch new products. This has been evident in 2024, with multiple reports having claimed that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s leading edge Blackwell chips are facing delays. Its CUDA software is another advantage since it enables users to fully control their GPUs. However, high GPU prices could incentivize NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s big ticket customers to design their own products and reduce the demand for its chips. Furthermore, if Wall Street decides that AI monetization is not worth the billions of dollars being spent, then the stock could see headwinds.\nBaron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\"More recently, however, we\u2019ve entered the period of doubts and questioning, some of which is real and normal in the first stages of a new paradigm, and some of which is prompted by short sellers. Given the explosive returns of NVIDIA and other AI leaders, AI bears and fear mongers have been comparing the current AI market winners with the internet bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, and NVIDIA\u2019s stock move today with Cisco\u2019s back then. First, while many stocks were trading at nosebleed valuations and on made up metrics (such as price per eyeballs) before the bursting of the internet bubble, as we\u2019ve said many times, the internet proved to transform our world and create the digital age we are now living in. Second, while NVIDIA\u2019s stock price inflection has been nothing short of unprecedented for a company of its size, it was fueled almost entirely by explosive growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows\u2013 not multiple expansion. Over the last 12 months, NVIDIA\u2019s stock has eectively tripled, but its forward P/E multiple has remained essentially flat, because NVIDIA blew away Wall Street expectations despite being covered by over 60 sell-side analysts, who have increased their forward projections every single quarter. In my career, the only comparative analogue is when Apple first introduced the iPhone and stunned Wall Street with its growth. In contrast, most of Cisco\u2019s move in the late 1990s was due to multiple expansion. At its peak, Cisco traded at a P/E ratio over 130 times, more than quadruple its five-year average of 37 times. At the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA traded at a P/E ratio of 40 times, equal to its five-year average, and at a P/E to growth (or PEG) ratio for 2025 of 0.8 times, as consensus expectations are for NVIDIA to grow earnings per share 40% next year.\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the star of the stock market this year. The artificial intelligence (AI) chip specialist has wowed investors with triple-digit revenue growth and an even faster surge on the bottom line as it drives the generative AI revolution forward.\nNo other stock in history has added trillions of dollars in market value so fast, and Nvidia even briefly became the most valuable company in the world, topping Apple and Microsoft. Year to date, Nvidia stock has surged 160% -- certainly, an impressive run.\nYet, some stocks have actually beaten the tech powerhouse this year. Keep reading below to see three of them, and whether they can continue to outperform Nvidia.\nCava Group (NYSE: CAVA) is one of the most impressive restaurant stocks to emerge on the market in years, arguably since Chipotle Mexican Grill. The founder of Panera Bread, Ron Shaich, was an early investor and serves as chair of the board, helping to steer the fast-casual chain toward success.\nCava has also adopted a Chipotle-like menu but with Mediterranean food and a similar minimalist industrial store design. The concept is clearly resonating with customers, according to its results. In the second quarter, Cava reported comparable sales growth of 14.4%, driven by a 9.5% jump in traffic, showing that the concept is catching on.\nIts average unit volumes, meaning the average annual revenue per restaurant, improved to $2.7 billion, approaching Chipotle's at $3.1 billion. Cava's restaurant-level profit margin is similarly impressive at 26.5% in the most recent quarter, which compares to 28.9% at Chipotle.\nCava's bottom-line profits are also jumping as net income tripled in the second quarter to $19.7 million. The chain is still small at 341 locations, which should give it a long runway of growth. After the earnings pop last Friday, Cava stock is now 182% this year.\nAnother restaurant chain, Sweetgreen (NYSE: SG), has also been a breakout performer this year as the fast-casual salad chain has surged thanks to strong growth numbers and a low share price at the beginning of the year.\nSweetgreen has taken a more circuitous route to its current level than Cava as the stock went public at the peak of the pandemic bubble and then crashed, along with nearly every other growth stock.\nSince then, the salad slinger has reassured investors of its potential, delivering both impressive growth and improving restaurant-level profits. It's also introduced a robotic kitchen assistant it calls Infinite Kitchen, which the company says is accelerating throughput and saving on labor costs.\nRevenue at Sweetgreen jumped 21% to $184.6 million in the second quarter, driven by same-store sales growth of 9%. Sweetgreen's average unit volume is at $2.9 billion, similar to Chipotle, and its restaurant-level profit margin improved from 20% to 22%.\nThe company is the leader in the fast-casual salad space, and it also has a lot of room for growth with just around 225 locations currently. Its Infinite Kitchen technology -- an automated system for preparing food -- adds another way for the company to differentiate itself.\nSo far this year, Sweetgreen stock has jumped 225%.\nCarvana (NYSE: CVNA) has been one of the biggest surprises in the stock market in recent years. The online used-car dealer was left for dead in 2022 as its once-rapid growth came to a halt and the business was on the brink of bankruptcy.\nHowever, through aggressive cost-cutting and stabilization in the used-car market, Carvana has rebounded, and the stock has continued to surge this year, up 194% year to date.\nBy sharply reducing its inventory and restructuring its debt, Carvana has been able to deliver positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income.\nCarvana has also returned to unit sales growth and solid revenue growth with sales up 23% in the second quarter.\nThe online used-car dealer should also benefit from lower interest rates. They would encourage more demand from car buyers and make it easier for Carvana to refinance its debt and lower its interest expense, which is still a significant cost for the company at more than half of its operating income.\nAll three of these stocks have earned their soaring performances this year with Sweetgreen and Carvana falling more into the turnaround category than Cava.\nOf the three of them, Cava looks like the most attractive right now as its execution and results have been nearly perfect since its initial public offering and it seems well-positioned to follow the growth path in the fast-casual sector carved out by Chipotle.\nCarvana, on the other hand, seems like the riskiest of the stocks as it still carries a substantial debt load and the cyclicality of the used car market can be brutal, though falling interest rates should be a tailwind for the company.\nFinally, Sweetgreen is another attractive growth story as a unique concept in the restaurant industry, and Infinite Kitchen could prove to be a key driver of profitability as the company adds it to more locations.\nFor investors comparing these stocks to Nvidia, it's important to understand that Nvidia's upside potential is likely rather limited at this point. With Nvidia's market capitalization at more than $3 trillion, even for it to gain 50% from here would mean a market value of greater than $4.5 trillion, and no company has ever reached $4 trillion in market value.\nThat doesn't mean that it can't be done, but if you're looking for the next five-bagger or 10-bagger stock, you're better off shifting your focus away from Nvidia to a smaller growth stock like Cava, Sweetgreen, or Carvana.\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cava Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Ian King ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. failed to live up to investor hopes with its latest results on Wednesday, delivering an underwhelming forecast and news of production snags with its much-awaited Blackwell chips.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office\nHong Kong\u2019s Arts Hub Turns to Selling Land to Stay Afloat\nA Guide to Urban Swimming in Europe, Beyond the Seine\nFollow news and analysis of Nvidia\u2019s earnings report in our live blog.\nThe company\u2019s quarterly report \u2014 the most anticipated part of the tech industry\u2019s earnings season \u2014 met or beat analysts\u2019 estimates on nearly every measure. But Nvidia investors have grown accustomed to blowout quarters, and the latest numbers didn\u2019t qualify.\nSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nMoreover, Nvidia\u2019s next big cash cow \u2014 the new Blackwell processor lineup \u2014 has proved more challenging to manufacture than anticipated. The product is the next generation of the company\u2019s dominant artificial intelligence processor.\nShares of Nvidia fell 6.4% to $117.59 in New York, their worst single-day decline in four weeks. The stock had more than doubled this year through Wednesday\u2019s close, following a gain of 239% in 2023.\n\u201cIt was up against lofty and unsustainable expectations,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kunjan Sobhani and Oscar Hernandez Tejada said in a note.\nThird-quarter revenue will be about $32.5 billion, the company said. Though analysts had predicted $31.9 billion on average, estimates ranged as high as $37.9 billion.\nThe disappointing outlook threatens to tamp down an AI frenzy that has transformed Nvidia into the world\u2019s second-most-valuable company. The chipmaker is the key beneficiary of a race to upgrade data centers to handle AI software, and its sales forecasts have become a barometer for that spending boom.\nHeading into the announcement, there was concern that Nvidia was having problems with its new Blackwell design. The company acknowledged that there were issues with production, saying that it was making changes to improve its manufacturing yield \u2014 the number of functioning chips that come out of factories. At the same time, the company said it expects to bring in \u201cseveral billion dollars\u201d of revenue in the fourth quarter from the product.\nSupplies will be plentiful after manufacturing gains momentum, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said later during a Bloomberg Television interview. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have lots and lots of supply, and we will be able to ramp,\u201d he said.\nNvidia is coming off a string of quarters that shattered Wall Street expectations \u2014 even as analysts continued to raise estimates. But the amount of upside has been trending down.\nMost of Nvidia\u2019s growth also has come from a small group of customers. About 40% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue stems from large data-center operators \u2014 companies like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Meta Platforms Inc. \u2014 which are pouring tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure.\nThough Meta and others have increased their capital expenditure budgets this earnings season, there\u2019s been concern that the amount of infrastructure being put in place exceeds current requirements. That could lead to a bubble. But Nvidia\u2019s Huang has maintained that this is only the beginning of a new era for technology and the economy.\nExpectations were lofty. Nvidia has been the best performing stock in the S&P 500 Index this year, eclipsing gains by all other semiconductor companies. At a market value of nearly $3 trillion, Nvidia is worth roughly the same amount as the next 10 largest chip firms combined.\nNvidia made its name by selling video-game cards, but is now best known for so-called AI accelerators. These chips, derived from its graphics processors, are used to develop artificial intelligence software by bombarding it with information.\nThe process, known as training, makes AI models better at recognizing and responding to real-world inputs. Nvidia\u2019s components are also used in systems that then run the software, a stage known as inference, and help power services such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nLast quarter\u2019s results topped Wall Street projections, and the Santa Clara, California-based company\u2019s board approved an additional $50 billion in stock buybacks.\nNvidia\u2019s revenue more than doubled to $30 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which ended July 28. Excluding certain items, profit was 68 cents a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $28.9 billion and earnings of 64 cents a share.\nNvidia got a jump on other chipmakers because its technology was well-suited to the needs of AI. But rivals are trying to catch up. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is now its closest competitor, with Intel Corp. \u2014 once the world\u2019s biggest chipmaker \u2014 trailing further behind. Their combined revenue from the market is only about 5% of Nvidia\u2019s total.\nNvidia\u2019s data-center division \u2014 now by far its largest source of sales \u2014 generated $26.3 billion of revenue last quarter. Gaming chips provided $2.9 billion. Analysts had given targets of $25.1 billion for the data-center unit and $2.79 billion for gaming.\nBlackwell is expected to generate a fresh wave of growth when it rolls out in the coming months. Analysts have downplayed concerns about delays, noting that the company still enjoys huge demand for its current generation of products. That could help Nvidia cope with any delays without a big financial hit.\nIn describing its challenges with Blackwell, Nvidia said it had to change a mask production step to improve its yield. A mask is the template used to burn the circuit pattern into materials deposited on a disk of silicon.\nProduction of Blackwell is set to ramp up in the fourth quarter and continue into the next fiscal year, Nvidia said.\nDuring a post-results conference call, analysts sought more details on the amount of revenue that the new Blackwell chips would deliver and when. Huang and Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress stuck to their promise of billions of dollars in the fourth quarter, refusing to elaborate further.\nThe stock extended its declines as the call went on and answers weren\u2019t provided.\nIn his typical fashion, Huang made high-level predictions on the future of the computing industry, arguing that a trillion dollars of equipment will be needed to replace outmoded gear in the world\u2019s data centers. That replacement process is just beginning, he said.\nAI is taking over computer search, helping companies speed up their business processes, and needed by countries to secure data, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s affecting how every layer of computing is done,\u201d Huang said.\n(Updates share price in the fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nJustice Is Beside the Point in America\u2019s Immigration Courts\nBrazil Decides to Cancel the Elon Show\nPrivate Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports\nHow Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis\nNeed 100,000 Balloons for a Convention?

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Before August 28",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is all set to release its fiscal 2025 second-quarter results (for the three months ended July 28) on Aug. 28, and analysts expect another quarter of outstanding growth from the company.\nMore specifically, LSEG Data & Analytics is forecasting Nvidia's revenue to increase by 112% on a year-over-year basis to $28.6 billion. That's slightly higher than the midpoint of Nvidia's revenue guidance range of $28 billion for Q2. However, LSEG data indicates that Nvidia's adjusted gross margin may have dropped from fiscal Q1 due to the company's investments in ramping up production capacity.\nIf that's accurate, Nvidia's gross margin would fall below its guidance of 75.5% for fiscal Q2. Now, a slip by Nvidia in its quarterly performance or the accompanying guidance could send its shares tumbling. If that's indeed the case, it may be a good idea for savvy investors to buy this semiconductor bellwether.\nHowever, the possibility of Nvidia's results and guidance exceeding expectations cannot be ruled out. In this article, we will examine three reasons why investors should consider buying Nvidia stock before its upcoming results.\nNvidia's expensive valuation has been a cause for concern in recent months, which is not surprising considering the stunning surge the stock has enjoyed since the end of 2022. However, a closer look at the stock's multiples will make it clear that investors are getting a good deal on this high-flying chipmaker right before its earnings report.\nNvidia currently trades at 48 times forward earnings. For comparison, the U.S. technology sector currently has an average earnings multiple of 46. Meanwhile, the stock's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) provides an even better gauge of how attractively valued Nvidia is right now. That's because the PEG ratio is a forward-looking valuation metric calculated by dividing a stock's trailing P/E ratio by the estimated earnings growth that it could deliver.\nA PEG ratio of less than 1 indicates that a stock is undervalued. By that measure, Nvidia stock seems extremely undervalued with respect to the earnings growth that it is likely to deliver.\nAs such, Nvidia is still a solid bet for investors looking to add a growth stock to their portfolios right now, especially considering that there are indications that it could deliver better-than-expected results.\nThe earnings season is about to end, which means that we can get a fair idea about the health of the AI hardware market based on results from other companies in this ecosystem.\nFor instance, Nvidia's foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, saw its top line jump 33% year over year in the second quarter of 2024 (which coincided with two months of Nvidia's fiscal Q2). That was a significant jump from the 13% year-over-year jump in revenue that TSMC delivered in the first quarter of the year. It is also worth noting that TSMC's July revenue increased 45% year over year, outpacing the growth it has witnessed in the first two quarters of the year.\nTSMC has been working hard in recent months to increase its packaging capacity of advanced chips that are used to manufacture AI chips for Nvidia. So, the surge in TSMC's quarterly revenue growth provides strong evidence of robust growth in Nvidia's revenue and earnings, especially because Nvidia is TSMC's second-largest customer.\nHowever, TSMC isn't the only AI hardware player that has seen a significant surge in revenue recently. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), which manufactures AI server solutions used for mounting chips from chipmakers such as Nvidia, reported 143% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on June 30).\nSupermicro attributed its phenomenal growth to the \"strong demand for next generation air-cooled and direct liquid-cooled (DLC) rack-scale AI GPU platforms.\" What's more, the midpoint of Supermicro's revenue guidance for the current quarter stands at $6.5 billion, which would be a 216% increase from the same quarter last year.\nAgain, this is an indication that Nvidia could be ramping up the production of its next-generation Blackwell chips, which the company had promised would arrive later in 2024. Nvidia, therefore, could not only deliver results that may outpace Wall Street's expectations, but its guidance could also turn out to be solid and help the stock sustain its stunning rally.\nTechnology titans such as Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon have been ramping up their capital expenditures (capex) to bolster their AI infrastructure. For instance, Microsoft's fiscal 2024 capital spending rose 75% from the previous year to almost $56 billion. The company expects to raise its capex once again in the current fiscal year to spend money on building more AI services so that it can position itself for long-term growth.\nAlphabet, on the other hand, could end the year with capex of around $50 billion as it intends to keep pouring money into servers and data centers. That would be a major increase over last year's capex of $32 billion. Even Meta raised its 2024 capital expenditure guidance to a range of $37 billion to $40 billion, up from the prior range of $35 billion to $40 billion. The social media giant's 2023 capex stood at $28 billion, and it expects its capital spending to continue rising into 2025.\nInvestors should note that all of these companies have been Nvidia's customers, purchasing the company's chips to train and deploy AI models. Even better, they are set to adopt the chipmaker's next-generation Blackwell processors as well, and Nvidia expects that the demand for these new chips will outpace supply well into 2025. This potential spending could carry the company for quarters and even years to come.\nIn all, there is enough evidence that the demand for Nvidia's AI chips continues to remain healthy, allowing it to deliver results that could exceed consensus estimates and guide above expectations. If that happens, shares of Nvidia could get another shot in the arm, which is why it may be a good idea for long-term-minded investors to buy this AI stock before it potentially soars further after Aug. 28.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged higher on Tuesday, jumping as much as 6.2%. As of 1:33 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 5.7%.\nThe catalyst that sent the chipmaker and artificial intelligence (AI) specialist higher were reports that delays of the Blackwell AI processor likely won't be as bad as originally feared.\nEarlier this month, reports suggested that Nvidia's much anticipated Blackwell B200 AI processor, which is scheduled to begin shipping later this year, would ship as much as three months late, thanks to a design flaw, according to a report that first appeared on the website The Information.\nWith billions of dollars in potential sales of the next-gen AI processor at stake, investors were justifiably concerned, sending the stock lower in the wake of the report.\nHowever, things may not be as bad as all that. Analysts at UBS have researched the matter and contend the shipments of the Blackwell chips are delayed by \"maybe four to six weeks at most, putting them at the very end of January 2025.\" Demand remains strong and will likely be filled by Nvidia's H200 processor during the shorter delay, the analyst wrote in a note to clients. UBS went on to suggest that research labs and enterprise customers alike continue to invest heavily in AI, \"both bullish indicators.\"\nIt's important for Nvidia investors to keep in mind that the company's growth -- particularly as it relates to AI -- will come in fits and starts. Furthermore, a look at Nvidia's stock chart reveals an important lesson. Even as the stock has gained 24,000% over the past decade, there have been numerous declines of 50% or more.\nInvestors with the ability to withstand the occasional gut-wrenching volatility that comes with owning this high-growth stock have been richly rewarded. Additionally, one must ignore the day-to-day machinations of the stock market in order to reap those rewards.\nNvidia might seem expensive at 42 times forward earnings, but I'd argue it's a reasonable price to pay for a company generating triple-digit growth and in pole position in the AI revolution.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) isn't new to Alphabet. In 2001, the company (then known as Google) incorporated machine learning into its search engine to help correct spelling errors. Five years later, it launched Google Translate -- a tool that used AI to translate languages.\nEric Schmidt was at Google's helm for both major AI milestones, serving as CEO from 2001 to 2011. He remained chairman of the board for four years before moving into the Executive Chairman position from 2015 through 2018.\nYou might think that Schmidt would view Google as the top dog in AI, but that doesn't appear to be the case. Here's why the former Google CEO thinks Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a no-brainer AI winner.\nSchmidt recently spoke to a class at Stanford University about AI. A video of his talk was initially posted online but subsequently taken down at his request. During the session, Schmidt expressed a positive view about Nvidia's prospects.\nThe former Google CEO remains connected to the technology industry. He told the Stanford students that major corporations he has spoken with plan to invest heavily in data centers to support AI and primarily use Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Schmidt said, \"I'm talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion -- very very hard.\"\nNvidia's rivals remain far behind, according to Schmidt. He thinks it will be challenging for them to close the gap with Nvidia for one simple reason: The open-source tools many AI developers are using are based on Nvidia's CUDA programming language.\nWhat about Advanced Micro Devices' new AI chips? Schmidt said that AMD's software used to translate CUDA code \"doesn't work yet.\"\nSchmidt told the Stanford students, \"If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market.\" He quickly added, \"That's not a stock recommendation.\" However, his statements are about as close to a recommendation for Nvidia as you can get without actually recommending buying the stock.\nNvidia reported $26 billion in revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The company's guidance projects revenue of $28 billion in Q2. If Schmidt is correct that an additional $300 billion in revenue is on the way for Nvidia soon, the stock should enjoy a big boost.\nAlthough he sounded most bullish about Nvidia, Schmidt also expressed a positive view about Nvidia's biggest customers. He argued that big companies with the financial flexibility to invest more heavily in Nvidia's chips will gain significant advantages over smaller rivals that can't afford to invest as much.\nSchmidt didn't specifically mention his former company as one of the likely AI winners. However, he did state there were only three \"frontier\" AI models and that the gap between those three models and others \"appears to be getting larger.\" Google Gemini is almost certainly one of those three AI models he alluded to along with OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude.\nNo investor should buy Nvidia stock solely because an influential technology leader thinks it should enjoy strong growth. Schmidt's view could be wrong. Even if he's right, Nvidia won't be a great fit for every investment portfolio.\nThat said, I fully agree with the former Google CEO that Nvidia stands to be a major beneficiary of increased AI spending by major corporations. Whether or not his $300 billion figure is correct, a boatload of money is likely to flow Nvidia's way over the next couple of years.\nOf course, Nvidia's market cap of $3.2 trillion already has a huge amount of sales growth baked in. Valuation expert Aswath Damodaran believes that the company will need a new growth market beyond AI infrastructure to be worthy of investors' interest right now. I think he could be right, too. But I also suspect Nvidia will have significant new market opportunities over the next few years.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Arsheeya Bajwa\n(Reuters) - Nvidia is likely to report on Wednesday that its second-quarter revenue more than doubled. But investors used to its blockbuster results will be expecting even more from the artificial intelligence chip giant.\nA beat or a miss on Wall Street expectations could either stoke or shatter an AI rally on Thursday, a day after Nvidia reports earnings for the May-July period.\nThe company's stock has surged more than 150% this year, adding $1.82 trillion to its market value and lifting the S&P 500 to new highs. On Monday, it was down 2.2% in afternoon trading, weighing on the index.\nThe stock is valued at about 37 times its forward earnings, compared with an average of around 29 for the top six tech companies on the benchmark index that includes the chipmaker.\nTech heavyweights, including Microsoft, which are spending heavily to build out their AI infrastructure, have been buying Nvidia's powerful graphic processing units that allow large amounts of computing quickly. These chips are difficult to replace in present-day datacenters, which has sharply boosted Nvidia's fortunes.\nNvidia is expected to have recorded a year-over-year jump of about 112% in second-quarter revenue to $28.68 billion, according to LSEG data as of Aug. 23.\nBut its adjusted gross margin likely dropped more than 3 percentage points to 75.8% from the first quarter, burdened by the cost of a production ramp-up to meet growing demand.\n\"They're not only a benchmark for chips, but they're also a benchmark for AI as a whole,\" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which owns shares in big U.S. tech firms, including Nvidia.\n\"If Nvidia misses, (investors are) going to sell off every company in AI.\"\nSome investors are concerned about the company's ability to meet lofty expectations and have questioned the pace of spending on AI by Nvidia's largest customers.\nThese worries led to a 20% slump in Nvidia's stock through much of July and early August, though a recent recovery has left the stock just about 5% below its record high in June.\nThere may be more trouble brewing around potential production delays of Nvidia's next generation Blackwell AI chips. CEO Jensen Huang said in May the chips would ship in the second quarter, but analysts have flagged design hurdles that could push the timeline.\nThis means revenue growth might take a hit in the first half of next year, research group SemiAnalysis said. Margins could also get squeezed if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, a possibility that the Taiwanese firm hinted at recently.\nNvidia is likely to forecast a 75% surge in third-quarter revenue to $31.69 billion, LSEG data showed, ending its five-quarter run of triple-digit growth and reflecting tough comparisons from a year ago when it surged about 206% to $18.12 billion.\nFor the past three quarters, Nvidia's growth exceeded 200%.\n\"We're reaching the law of large numbers here, once a company gets to a certain size, it just physically can't keep up the same growth,\" said Michael Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital.\nSome analysts said Nvidia could offset much of the hit from the delay in Blackwell chips by substituting those orders with its prior generation Hopper chips. The Hopper family of processors is not as powerful or lucrative as Blackwell, but it is sufficient for most AI-related applications.\nInvestors will also seek updates on AI processors for the China market, where sales of its most advanced chips are barred by the U.S. government.\nNvidia's China-focused processors, reportedly called H20 and less powerful than its best chips, could help the company gain business over the next few quarters in a major market where domestic champion Huawei has emerged as a competitor.\nThere are also mounting antitrust concerns about the company's practices. US regulators are probing whether Nvidia pressured cloud providers to buy multiple products, and if it is trying to bundle its networking equipment with their sought-after AI chips.\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh)\n"

        "Text": "Updated at 9:12 AM EDT\nNvidia shares edged higher on Aug 15 as traders sifted through a host of regulatory filings that updated the portfolio holdings of some of the world's biggest investors.\nNvidia (NVDA) shares are down 4.4% for the quarter after their stunning first-half advance of around 150%. Still, the AI giant remains one of the market's key sentiment barometers heading into the year's final months as investors look to its second-quarter earnings later this month to consolidate the AI demand story.\nSome of Wall Street's biggest investors, however, appear to be looking elsewhere for their exposure to AI stocks, although many of the top funds that attract retail, retirement, and index-tracking investors continue to add the name to their portfolios, according to the latest batch of 13-F filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nBloomberg/Getty Images\nInvestment funds with more than $100 million in assets must notify the SEC regarding portfolio changes quarterly.\nThe reports, known as 13-F filings, are backdated to the end of the previous quarter. While they do not include the full scope of holdings nor possible bets against a particular security, they do provide a glimpse into the strategies of some of the world's biggest investors.\nThree big names appeared to have slashed their exposure to Nvidia last quarter, including David Tepper's Appaloosa Management, which dumped around 3.7 million shares, or 84.4% of its holdings, over the three months ending in June.\nThe stock now represents around 1.4% of his $17.3 billion portfolio.\nStanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office unloaded around 1.5 million Nvidia shares, representing around 88% of his holdings in the stock, while activist investor Elliott Management sold a small 50,000 holding in the chipmaker.\nSoros Fund Management, the investment vehicle founded by billionaire investor George Soros, also exited Nvidia, selling around 217,000 shares.\nRelated: Top analyst puts Nvidia stock on key list after $500 million slump\nOn the buy side, State Street purchased $76.6 million Nvidia shares, with the stock now representing the second-largest holding in its $2.29 trillion portfolio behind Microsoft (MSFT) .\nVanguard, meanwhile, added $11.4 million in Nvidia shares, making it the number three holding. In comparison, BlackRock purchased a net $16.9 million shares, pegging Nvidia as the second-largest holding (again behind Microsoft) in its massive $4.4 trillion portfolio. State Street, Vanguard, and BlackRock manage large exchange-traded funds that track the major market indexes as a key part of their business.\nNvidia will publish its highly anticipated second-quarter earnings on August 28. Analysts expect its bottom-line profits to rise by around 137% to 64 cents per share, with revenues more than doubling from the same period last year to $28.55 billion.\nHowever, investors will be focused on reports that delivery of its newly launched line of Blackwell processors, which are meant to be faster, cheaper, and more efficient than its H100 'Hopper' predecessors, could be delayed due to design flaws.\nAnalysts had expected Blackwell to generate revenue for Nvidia starting in the third quarter and find their way into global customer data centers by the year's final three months.\nRelated: Nvidia stock tumbles in tech slump amid questions over key chip\nAI demand and Nvidia's commanding market share are predicted to drive the group's data center revenue as high as $150 billion next year, powered largely by this year's Blackwell launch.\nSome analysts are also starting to question the pace of AI spending from hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Meta Platforms (META) , Amazon (AMZN,) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and the resultant demand for the high-end chips and processors produced by Nvidia.\nHyperscalers, the major providers of massive data centers and cloud services, are, in fact, poised to spend around $500 billion over the next two years building out their massive infrastructure, according to estimates from Barclays, as they leverage their massive datasets to enhance sales of everything from drive-through dining to the most complicated pharmaceutical testing.\nMore AI Stocks:\nNvidia stock tumbles in tech slump amid questions over key chip\nMicrosoft exec warns of an ongoing problem\nApple earnings top forecasts, iPhone sales slip ahead of AI launch\nA recent report from S&P Global estimated that AI spending will grow by more than 20% through 2028 and will then represent around 14% of all IT spending, more than double its 2023 total.\n\"Cloud giants are heavily investing in AI despite uncertain monetization timelines, with combined capital spending for Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta up 60% year over year,\" said S&P Global's technology director Christian Frank.\nNvidia shares were last marked 0.65% higher in premarket trading, indicating an opening bell price of $118.85 each.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of pain coming for stocks\n"

        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw a significant share price rise of 33% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at NVIDIA\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n View our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nAccording to our valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 33%, trading at US$118 compared to our intrinsic value of $88.99. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that NVIDIA\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? NVDA\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NVDA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nIf you'd like to know more about NVIDIA as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to release earnings results for its second quarter, after the closing bell on Wednesday.\nAnalysts expect the Santa Clara, California-based company to report quarterly earnings at 64 cents per share, up sharply from 25 cents per share in the year-ago period. NVIDIA projects to report quarterly revenue of $28.68 billion for the quarter, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nOn Tuesday, Truist Securities analyst William Stein maintained NVIDIA with a Buy rating and raised the price target from $140 to $145.\nWith the recent buzz around NVIDIA, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, NVIDIA offers an annual dividend yield of 0.03%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 1 cent per share (4 cents a year).\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $19,245,000 or around 150,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $3,849,000 or around 30,000 shares.\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.04 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.04 = 150,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.04 = 30,000 shares ($100 per month).\nView more earnings on NVDA\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock\u2019s current price.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nNVDA Price Action: Shares of Nvidia gained 1.5% to close at $128.30 on Tuesday.\n\nRead More: \nMicrosoft, Synaptics And 2 Other Stocks Executives Are Selling\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From NVIDIA Stock Ahead Of Q2 Earnings Report originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "Nvidia turned in yet another stellar earnings report this week, but with the chip giant priced for perfection amid the AI boom, the stock was still down Thursday.\nThe risk when a stock is \u201cpriced for perfection\u201d is that investors\u2019 high expectations leave little room for underperformance or error. Positive outcomes are already factored in, and investors assume things will go swimmingly\u2014meaning even a slight hint of vulnerability could lead to a price correction.\nAccordingly, Nvidia\u2019s drop could be a sign that investors are starting to question whether earnings expectations for tech stocks have risen so dramatically in recent years due to AI euphoria that even strong earnings growth won\u2019t be enough to warrant further share price appreciation, Thomas Matthews, Capital Economics\u2019 head of markets, Asia Pacific, explained. But for now, the veteran market watcher said he isn\u2019t worried.\n\u201cWe think the AI rally has further to run, despite investors\u2019 apparent disappointment with Nvidia\u2019s rapid profit growth,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients Thursday.\nWall Street analysts aren\u2019t backing down from their lofty price targets after the pullback in Nvidia shares either, with most saying the price drop is a buying opportunity.\nBank of America Global Research analysts, led by Vivek Arya, reiterated their buy rating and raised their price target on Nvidia shares from $150 to $165 after the earnings release yesterday. Nvidia offers \u201cunique growth at a very reasonable valuation\u201d and remains the \u201ckey genAI cycle beneficiary,\u201d they wrote in a note to clients, imploring them to \u201cignore quarterly noise.\u201d\nDespite consistent warnings about Nvidia\u2019s stretched valuation, Arya and his team noted that the company trades at roughly 30 to 35 times its calendar year 2025 earnings, and with expectations for 40% plus earnings-per-share growth ahead, they say that\u2019s actually a \u201ccompelling valuation.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s gross margin, a measure of its profitability, fell slightly in the fiscal second quarter, however, to 75.1%, from 78.4% in the fiscal first quarter. And the company forecast its gross margin to be in the \u201cmid-70% range\u201d for the full year 2024, compared to expectations for a hair higher at 76.4%. Declining gross margins can indicate pressure on profits or increased competition, but investors typically wait to see if the drop is a temporary dip or the start of a longer-term trend.\n\u201cIn terms of the fundamentals, the gross margin was probably the only slightly negative call-out, but it was relatively well explained and was still in line with guidance,\u201d John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, told Fortune of the issue via email.\nDespite the slight margin drop, Nvidia\u2019s earnings were strong in the fiscal second quarter. The company pulled in more than $30 billion in revenue, beating analysts\u2019 consensus estimate for $28.7 billion. And it was a similar story with net income, which rose 168% year over year to $16.6 billion, compared to the expected $15 billion.\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nRevenue guidance for the fiscal third quarter also topped analysts\u2019 consensus forecast, hitting $32.5 billion. But it slightly undershot the forecasts of a few more-optimistic analysts, and also implied a slowdown in revenue growth to 80% year over year in the coming quarter.\nOverall, Nvidia\u2019s earnings report was a \u201cmic drop moment\u201d for CEO Jensen Huang that confirms the \u201cAI revolution\u201d is here to stay, according to Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.\nIves said that although some optimistic analyst revenue guidance forecasts were \u201ca tad higher\u201d than the actual numbers, Nvidia\u2019s outlook was still \u201crobust,\u201d demand for its AI-critical chips remains strong, and concerns about delays with its new Blackwell chips were \u201callayed.\u201d To his point, Nvidia said it will see \u201cseveral billion dollars\u201d of Blackwell revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\u201cNvidia's results/outlook/conference call only bolstered and validated our bullish view,\u201d Ives wrote, adding \u201cNvidia has changed the tech and global landscape as its GPUs have become the new oil and gold.\u201d\nUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri echoed his Wall Street peers' bullish comments in a Thursday note to clients, reiterating his buy rating and $150 price target for Nvidia stock.\nArcuri pointed to growth in Nvidia\u2019s purchase commitments and supply obligations, arguing they are \u201cthe most important metric we watch\u201d and have been \u201chistorically a harbinger of future growth.\u201d Nvidia revealed it has $27.8 billion in purchase commitments in the fiscal second quarter, as well as $6.7 billion in inventory. That lifted what UBS calls Nvidia\u2019s \u201ctotal supply\u201d by 40% quarter-over-year\u2014compared to 15% growth last quarter, and no growth in the fourth quarter. \u201cWe believe this foreshadows very strong revenue growth over the next few [quarters],\u201d Arcuri wrote of the figures.\nGabelli Funds\u2019 Belton noted that Nvidia also addressed the two primary bear cases against it.\nFirst, as previously discussed, the company dealt with concerns about delays with its new Blackwell chip by providing guidance for revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter. \u201cA clear sign of confidence,\u201d Belton said.\nSecond, Nvidia was able to speak to skepticism about its key customers potentially overspending on AI infrastructure, which could mean lower demand in the future. That\u2019s critical, given that nearly half of Nvidia\u2019s fiscal second quarter revenue came from just four customers.\n\u201cImportantly, management laid out a compelling case that large consumer internet customers like META, GOOGL, and AMZN are already generating significant returns on AI spending in their core businesses,\u201d Belton said, adding that for AI model and application builders, it\u2019s a similar story. \u201cNVDA again spoke to the urgency with which these companies are \u2018clamoring\u2019 for as much infrastructure as they can afford in the hopes of winning the race to commercialize breakthroughs in AI technology.\u201d\nNancy Tengler, CEO and CIO of Laffer Tengler Investments, backed up the idea that AI spending is just getting started, and that the investment has proved worthwhile for most firms, noting that \u201cold economy companies are embracing AI to improve margins.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not the internet bubble,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think the sell-off is an opportunity to accumulate [NVDA] stock.\u201d\nOf course, not every Wall Street analyst is bullish on Nvidia. There aren't currently any analysts with a sell rating for the company, but there are five with hold or hold-equivalent ratings. D.A. Davidson's Gil Luria is one of them.\nIn a note to clients Thursday, Luria said he fears that a decline in demand for Nvidia's chips is inevitable, as its customers begin to focus on the return on investment of their AI spending. \"End customers are going to become more scrupulous,\" he warned.\nLuria has a neutral rating for Nvidia and $90 price target, implying a potential 25% drop in Nvidia's share price over the next 12 months.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Texas Instruments Inc.\u2019s TXN.\nAfter finishing 2023 on a high note, NVIDIA Corporation squashed bubble fears, and its shares soared 155.4% year to date, outperforming the Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s gain of 113.8%. However, NVIDIA\u2019s stock price faced hiccups in early August on fears that its tech customers may curtail artificial intelligence (AI) spending budgets.\nBut NVIDIA\u2019s shares did recover ahead of the much-awaited second-quarter fiscal earnings report that can have rippling effects on the broader tech sector. Therefore, investors are rightly contemplating whether to book profits and move on or hold on to NVIDIA\u2019s shares for better returns in the future. Let us, thus, look at how to play NVIDIA\u2019s shares as of now.\nNVIDIA\u2019s high profit margin may lead to its vulnerability soon. For first-quarter fiscal 2025, NVIDIA\u2019s gross profit margin increased to 78.9% from 66.8% a year ago. However, sustaining such higher profit margins is difficult as demand-supply disparity will lessen in the semiconductor industry where peers are also manufacturing commendable competing products.\nIn a competitive environment, NVIDIA would be compelled to lower the price of its products, and profit margins could take a beating. Huawei is planning to introduce its Ascend 910C chips as early as October, which can compete with NVIDIA\u2019s H100 AI chips. Moreover, any possible trade ban on NVIDIA from selling its H20 AI chips to China may hit its profit margins.\nNVIDIA benefits from tech behemoths\u2019 spending on AI-related infrastructure. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to trim interest rates in the September policy meeting, mega-tech capital expenditure (CAPEX) spending is expected to rise, a blessing for NVIDIA.\nAI, anyhow, is a growing trend and not a temporary phenomenon. NVIDIA\u2019s strong positioning in the AI field should help its shares rise. MarketsandMarkets estimated the AI industry to grow from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion by 2030.\nNVIDIA is also well-poised to make the most of the growing gaming market through its primary gaming graphic processing units (GPU) product line, GeForce. According to research firm Newzoo, the global gaming market will generate $187.7 billion in revenues this year. At the same time, NVIDIA is collaborating with Siemens to build an industrial metaverse, a market that is expected to reach $228.6 billion in 2029 from $28.7 billion in 2024, per MarketsandMarkets.\nMeanwhile, rumors regarding the production delay of NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell AI chips may have caused a lot of concerns. But NVIDIA recently confirmed that Blackwell sampling has begun, and the next-generation chips will be launched later this year. NVIDIA is the worldwide leader in AI chip design and software, giving the company a competitive edge over its rivals.\nWhat\u2019s more, NVIDIA is yet again expected to post encouraging earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which may help its share prices to climb. NVIDIA is projected to report earnings per share of $0.63 for the fiscal second quarter, more than $0.27 a year ago, indicating a jump of 133.3%.\nNVIDIA has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 18.4%, a tell-tale indication that the stock has a reasonable chance to display earnings growth in the forthcoming earnings release on Wednesday, after the bell.\nDespite the positives, buying the NVIDIA stock may burn a hole in your pocket. This is because the unquenchable demand for AI models and dominance in GPUs has made the NVIDIA stock expensive.\nBy looking at the price/earnings ratio, NVIDIA stock currently trades at 46.9X forward earnings. However, NVIDIA\u2019s rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.\u2019s forward earnings multiples are 44.6X, 16.9X, 33.8X and 40.7X, respectively.\nHence, astute investors should wait to buy on the dips. And those who have already bought NVIDIA\u2019s shares should hang on to it. After all, NVIDIA stock is for the long run, as AI is here to stay. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Author": "  Greg McKenna ",
        "Text": "They\u2019ve been called the \u201cmost important tech earnings in years.\u201d Whether or not the claim from famed tech bull Dan Ives is hyperbole, there\u2019s no doubt, as he put it, that \u201cthe popcorn [is] getting ready.\u201d Wall Street is expecting another blowout quarter from the world\u2019s premier chip stock, and Wednesday\u2019s results have the potential to boost a sector-wide rally\u2014or, if the company comes up short, cause stocks to tumble.\nNvidia\u2019s earnings are a referendum on both AI investment and the semiconductor industry, multiple industry analysts told Fortune, because of the company\u2019s dominant position in producing the advanced graphics processing units, or GPUs, at the heart of the AI boom. Nvidia\u2019s breakneck growth will inevitably decelerate, they added (year-on-year growth over 250% isn\u2019t sustainable forever). Risks ranging from competitive to macroeconomic to geopolitical loom in the coming years, but the good times should at least endure for now.\n\u201cThe bottom line is they\u2019re shipping to clients, mainly Microsoft [Amazon Web Services] and Meta, as much as they can manufacture,\u201d said Ted Mortonson, a managing director and technology desk sector strategist at Baird. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have another unbelievable quarter.\u201d\nThe generative AI wave has rapidly made Nvidia one of the world\u2019s most powerful companies. Revenue jumped 262% to over $26 billion last quarter, beating expectations by more than $1 billion, compared with just over $7 billion the year before. The company is now the second-largest in the U.S. by market cap, which has grown nearly $2 trillion this past year to just north of $3.1 trillion.\nThis has allowed investors to reap massive gains. The stock has grown over 166% year to date, trading above the $128 mark at Tuesday\u2019s close. Investors who have held the stock over the past five years have seen shares gain roughly 3,000%, nearly doubling their investment year over year.\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nThe company\u2019s broader impact on the overall market has also been staggering. As Big Tech fueled the S&P 500\u2019s record highs during the first half of the year, Nvidia accounted for nearly 30% of the index\u2019s total return during that span.\nFrom an earnings perspective, though, Nvidia will inevitably soon become a victim of its own success. Even Wall Street\u2019s AI darling will run up against the law of large numbers.\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\u201cThese comparisons are biblical,\u201d Mortonson said. \u201cI have never seen a company for the last year exceed expectations to this degree, and it\u2019s not Nvidia\u2019s fault. They\u2019re just running into brutally tough comparisons.\u201d\nThis deceleration, however, is already partially baked into the stock price, according to Angelo Zino, a senior vice president and tech equity analyst at CFRA Research.\n\u201cWhen you look at the valuation of this company,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s trading at a big discount to where it actually historically trades at.\u201d\nAt its last earnings call, Nvidia forecast revenue of $28 billion, still well over double last year\u2019s number, with the Street expecting the chipmaker to beat its own guidance by over $800 million.\nWhether or not the company meets those estimates will be viewed by many as a barometer for the state of both AI investment and the semiconductor industry overall. Given the supremacy of Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPUs, eventually set to be replaced by its next-generation Blackwell line, they\u2019re basically a proxy for demand, Zino noted, across the AI spectrum.\n\u201cNvidia is kind of perceived as the center of the universe when it comes to this AI trade,\u201d he said.\nFortunately for chipmakers, the tech giants feel compelled to spend on AI like \u201cdrunken sailors,\u201d as Mortonson put it, a phenomenon he and Zino don\u2019t see slowing much over the next year. With Nvidia getting more orders than it can fill, semiconductor companies like Micron, Marvell, and Broadcom also stand to benefit.\n\u201cThe big takeaway is what\u2019s good for Nvidia is typically good for a lot of the other chipmakers that kind of sell into the data-center space,\u201d Zino said.\nAs if investors didn\u2019t already have enough reasons to tune in.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Aug. 28 Could Be a Massive Day for Nvidia Stock. Is It a Buy Right Now?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks on the market, and for good reason. It has put up incredible growth numbers quarter after quarter lately, and each time, the stock has popped following those reports. With Nvidia's second-quarter FY 2025 results being announced on Aug. 28 after the markets close, investors may want to consider buying Nvidia stock before that date.\nHowever, these results may differ from some of its previous announcements, as year-over-year comparisons are becoming more difficult.\nNvidia's rise is tied to its primary product: graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs were developed by Nvidia back in the '90s as devices that could process gaming graphics more efficiently than a CPU. While GPUs excelled in this field, other uses were quickly developed for them.\nBecause a GPU can process multiple calculations in parallel, it is useful for calculation-intensive tasks like engineering simulations, drug discovery, and AI model training. The latter has caused its business to explode, and we'll get a checkup on demand next week when the company releases its most recent quarterly results.\nFor Q2, management told investors to expect $28 billion in revenue. Compared to last year's Q2 sales of $13.5 billion, that represents 107% year over year growth. That would be an impressive jump, but would represent a growth rate slowdown compared to previous quarters.\nThis slowdown is occurring because we are overlapping the period when AI demand really started to take off. Still, I wouldn't consider a doubling of revenue a disappointment. Additionally, don't be surprised if Nvidia beats that target. It has consistently outperformed its guidance over the past year, and Wall Street analysts are starting to catch on to this trend. From an average of 40 analysts, they collectively think Nviida's Q2 revenue will be $28.5 billion.\nWhile year-over-year revenue growth is an important stat, there are others that I think are more important to consider, with margin at the top of that list.\nNvidia's revenue growth has been nothing short of incredible, but its margin expansion has been even more impressive. With a gross margin near 80% and a profit margin approaching 60%, Nvidia has become one of the most profitable companies ever to trade on the public markets.\nWhen the Q2 report comes out, I'll be looking to see if the company has maintained or expanded these elevated levels. If investors see weakness in these margins, it's a sign that Nvidia is facing increased competition and needed to adjust the price of its GPUs to stay competitive in the market.\nI don't expect a margin drop, but if one does occur, don't be surprised if the stock gets slammed immediately after the release of information.\nWith Nvidia expected to report another strong quarter, many investors may wonder if they should invest now, before the report. Investors should first consider that investing success hardly ever comes from trying to time the market and jump in and out at just the right time.\nThey should also consider how expensive the stock is, trading at nearly 46 times forward earnings estimates.\nThe stock has a lot of growth baked into it, and Nvidia will need to report a strong Q2 and give impressive Q3 guidance to justify the optimism.\nFor many investors (including myself), the price is too high. But for others, it may still represent a buying opportunity. At this valuation, Nvidia needs to report another year or two of flawless quarters; otherwise, it could be knocked from its perch. If you believe it can do that, Nvidia's stock could still be interesting here. But with its history of reporting strong earnings, and being rewarded by investors for doing so, if you're ready to be a buyer, you might want to buy before Aug. 28.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sean Williams ",
        "Text": "Over the last 30 years, no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends have graced Wall Street. Since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, no innovation, technology, or trend has come close to having the impact on corporate growth rates as the internet... until now.\nAccording to the analysts at PwC, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has the ability to increase global gross domestic product by more than $15 trillion in 2030. This is a mammoth addressable market that can support multiple big-time winners.\nYet in spite of the euphoria surrounding AI on Wall Street, quarterly filed Form 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission point to mixed feelings for artificial intelligence-inspired stocks. A 13F provides investors with a concise snapshot of which stocks the smartest and most-successful money managers have been buying and selling.\nIn the June-ended quarter, billionaire investors sent shares of AI leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) to the chopping block and decisively piled into what can be considered their new favorite artificial intelligence stock.\nWhat's particularly interesting about the selling activity in Nvidia is it marks the third straight quarter of selling by at least a half-dozen prominent billionaires. The June-ended quarter saw seven billionaire investors lighten their load, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (9,282,018 shares)\nDavid Tepper of Appaloosa (3,730,000 shares)\nStanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (1,545,370 shares)\nCliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,360,215 shares)\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (676,242 shares)\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (409,042 shares)\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (96,963 shares)\nProfit-taking and the need to diversify are two possible answers as to why some or all of these billionaires felt the need to reduce their stakes in Nvidia.\nSince 2023 began, Nvidia's market cap has grown by $2.75 trillion, as of the closing bell on Aug. 23, 2024, which led to the company's largest-ever stock split (10-for-1) in June. This increase is due to the company's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) becoming the standard in AI-accelerated data centers, as well as Nvidia possessing jaw-dropping pricing power, which is reflective of enterprise demand for its AI-GPUs overwhelming supply.\nBut there are far more reasons than just profit-taking that might explain this ongoing billionaire exodus from Nvidia.\nOne of the more logical conclusions to draw is that at least some of these billionaires are concerned about competitive pressures following its parabolic climb. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is ramping up production of its MI300X AI-GPU and doesn't have the same chip-fabrication supply constraints as Nvidia. Further, AMD's chip typically sells for $10,000 to $15,000, which is far below the $30,000 to $40,000 Nvidia is commanding for the H100.\nCompetitive pressures can manifest from within, as well. Nvidia's four largest customers by net sales \u2014 Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet \u2014 have developed in-house AI-GPUs for use in their data centers. Even though these in-house chips won't have the same computing capacity as Nvidia's H100, they're going to take up valuable data center \"real estate\" and minimize Nvidia's opportunities moving forward.\nThese seven billionaire sellers might also be concerned about history. At no point over the last three decades has there been a hyped innovation, technology, or trend that managed to avoid an early stage bubble-bursting event. Without exception, investors always overestimate the utility and adoption of new innovations.\nDespite all the buzz with artificial intelligence, very few businesses have well-defined game plans as to how they're going to generate a positive return on their data center investment. This is a glaring warning that investors have, once again, overestimated the uptake of this technology. If and when the AI bubble bursts, no company is likely to be hit harder than Nvidia.\nBut while billionaires were showing shares of Nvidia to the door, they were avidly scooping up shares of what can arguably be described as their new favorite AI stock. A total of seven billionaire money managers were buyers of shares of AI networking solutions specialist Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) during the second quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,930,970 shares)\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (2,347,500 shares)\nIsrael Englander of Millenium Management (2,096,440 shares)\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,880,740 shares)\nJohn Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (1,332,230 shares)\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (865,090 shares)\nKeep in mind that the above share counts have been adjusted for Broadcom's 10-for-1 stock split, which occurred after the close of trading on July 12.\nJust as Nvidia's hardware has become a staple in high-compute data centers, Broadcom has quickly asserted its dominance as a key AI networking solutions provider. For instance, its Jericho3-AI fabric is capable of connecting up to 32,000 GPUs, with the goal of reducing tail latency and maximizing the computing capacity of these chips.\nWhile AI has undoubtedly been a catalyst, the reason I suspect billionaires have made Broadcom their favorite AI stock is that, unlike Nvidia, it's not entirely reliant on AI for growth. If the AI bubble bursts, Broadcom has a multitude of other revenue channels it can turn to as a cushion.\nFor example, Broadcom has a leading position as a provider of wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. Wireless companies have willingly spent billions to upgrade their networks to support 5G download speeds. In turn, this has led to a steady device-replacement cycle that's spurred demand for Broadcom's products.\nBeyond smartphones, you'll find Broadcom supplying networking solutions to businesses from all sectors and industries, along with cybersecurity solutions and financial software, to name some of its other ventures.\nBroadcom has also leaned on acquisitions as a way to expand its product and service ecosystem, promote cross-selling opportunities, and grow its bottom line. Its $69 billion buyout of cloud virtualization software provider VMware, which closed in November, is a perfect example of Broadcom broadening its reach in private and hybrid enterprise clouds.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine ",
        "Text": "Recently filed Forms 13F show that two high-profile hedge fund managers sold shares of Nvidia during the second quarter while reallocating capital to the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).\nDavid Shaw at D.E. Shaw sold 12.1 million shares of Nvidia, trimming his position by 52%. Meanwhile, he bought 2.4 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, increasing his position by 1,658%.\nSteven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management sold 409,042 shares of Nvidia, trimming his position by 16%. He bought 1.6 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, diversifying into cryptocurrency for the first time.\nThe trades made by Shaw and Cohen are noteworthy because both fund managers have credentials beyond their status as billionaires. D.E. Shaw and Point72 rank second and 13th, respectively, among the 20 best-performing hedge funds in history, according to LCH Investments.\nThat said, investors shouldn't interpret their trades to mean Nvidia is a bad investment, but rather, that portfolio diversification is important. Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks like Nvidia could create substantial wealth over time, but the same is true of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Some Wall Street experts think Bitcoin (and consequently, the iShares Bitcoin Trust) could surge 83,000%.\nBitcoin entered the year at full steam. Its price had more than doubled in 2023, and the gains accelerated in early 2024 when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs on U.S. stock exchanges. Excitement surrounding the April halving event also contributed to the upward momentum.\nBitcoin hit a record high above $73,000 in March before stumbling when investors lost their appetites for risk. Economic uncertainty caused the sentiment reversal. Investors entered the year thinking the Federal Reserve would cut its benchmark interest rate by June, but policymakers have kept rates at their highest level in two decades.\nThe situation changed from bad to worse in early August. Recession fears resurfaced when a weak jobs report raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve was moving too slowly. That concern caused the stock market to plunge, and the cryptocurrency market suffered its worst sell-off since FTX collapsed in 2022.\nBitcoin currently trades at $59,000, about 20% below its March peak. But these Wall Street experts remain exceedingly bullish on the cryptocurrency.\nBernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra think Bitcoin will trade at $200,000 by 2025, $500,000 by 2029, and $1 million by 2033 as spot Bitcoin ETFs unlock demand from retail and institutional investors. The high end of that forecast implies 1,595% upside.\nArk Invest published a valuation model in 2023 that priced Bitcoin at $1.5 million per coin by 2030. But CEO Cathie Wood revised that figure to $3.8 million at a Bitcoin conference in March, based on the idea that institutional investors will allocate about 5% of their assets to Bitcoin in the future. That forecast implies 6,440% upside.\nMicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor recently delivered a keynote speech at a Bitcoin conference that included an ultra-bullish price target. \"It could be a $3 million bear case, it could be a $49 million bull case,\" he said. The low end of his predicted range implies 5,085% upside, and the high end implies 83,000% upside.\nBitcoin's price is a function of supply and demand. However, Bitcoin supply is limited to 21 million coins, meaning demand is the most consequential variable.\nThat's where spot Bitcoin ETFs could make a big difference. Those new funds eliminate traditional sources of friction by letting investors add Bitcoin exposure to existing brokerage accounts.\nIn other words, investors no longer need a separate account with a cryptocurrency exchange or have to pay exorbitant fees for each transaction. Several spot Bitcoin ETFs bear relatively low expense ratios. For instance, the iShares Bitcoin Trust charges an annual fee of 0.25%, so investors will pay $25 for every $10,000 invested in the fund.\nBy reducing friction, spot Bitcoin ETFs are bringing more retail and institutional investors to the market. For instance, the iShares Bitcoin Trust accumulated more assets during its first 50 trading days than any ETF in history, according to Eric Balchunas at Bloomberg. The fund also reached $10 billion in assets faster than any ETF on record, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nThat said, spot Bitcoin ETFs have a ways to go before reaching 5% of institutional assets under management (AUM), which is what Cathie Wood expects over time. Institutional AUM totaled $120 trillion last year, and 5% of that figure is roughly $6 trillion. Collectively, spot Bitcoin ETFs have less than $60 billion in assets right now.\nBitcoin miners earn block subsidies (newly minted Bitcoin) for solving the cryptographic puzzles required to verify transactions. But the payout is reduced by 50% every time 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain. Those so-called halving events happen about once every four years, and the most recent one took place in April.\nThat is significant for two reasons. First, the halving event means miners will be minting less Bitcoin over the next four years, which will reduce one source of selling pressure simply because they have less Bitcoin to sell. Second, Bitcoin has gone through three halving cycles previously, and its price has always peaked 12 to 18 months later, as shown in the chart below.\nHalving Date\nPeak Return\nTime to Peak Return\nNovember 2012\n10,485%\n371 days\nJuly 2016\n3,103%\n525 days\nMay 2020\n707%\n546 days\nSource: Fidelity Digital Assets.\nIn short, history says Bitcoin will reach a new record high sometime between April 2025 and October 2025.\nPast performance is never a guarantee of future returns, and investors shouldn't take the forecasts I've discussed for granted. I find the price target of $49 million (which implies an upside of 83,000%) absurd.\nAdditionally, Bitcoin is a relatively new asset class, so there's limited data available to make predictions about how it may perform in different economic climates. Bitcoin has also been very volatile throughout its short history. The cryptocurrency has declined more than 50% on several occasions and similar drawdowns are likely in the future.\nRisk-tolerant investors comfortable with that possibility should consider investing a small percentage of their portfolios in Bitcoin, either by purchasing the cryptocurrency directly or through a spot Bitcoin ETF. I think investors should limit their exposure to 5% of invested assets.\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Bitcoin Trust, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and iShares Bitcoin Trust wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jowi Morales ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nSources from both Nvidia and Microsoft reportedly confirm that Nvidia is delaying its upcoming Blackwell AI GPUs from the expected fourth-quarter launch to potentially the first quarter of 2025. Two anonymous sources who worked on the chip itself and its server hardware first released this news, while\u00a0Bloomberg\u00a0allegedly corroborated it with its unnamed contact at Microsoft.\nThe news is a surprise as Nvidia had just\u00a0delivered engineering samples\u00a0earlier this week, with the B100 and B200 seemingly on track for a late 2024 release. The delay means that large customers like Microsoft, Meta, and xAI\u2014which aims to\u00a0purchase 300,000 B200 GPUs\u2014would likely have to wait until 2Q25 at the earliest before Nvidia could fulfill their massive orders.\nMeta has already doubted Nvidia's capability to deliver the Blackwell GPUs in 2024, saying it did not expect to receive shipments of Nvidia's new flagship GPU this year. The sources claimed design flaws, so it's better to delay the release of a product to work out the kinks, like AMD did with the Ryzen 9000, than to suffer a catastrophic chip failure after launch, like the instability issues that Intel is suffering with the 13th\u2014and 14th-generation Core processors.\nGetting it right the first time is crucial for Nvidia, especially as its AI Superchips cost up to $70,000 apiece, and a complete server rack costs $3,000,000 or more. With the company expecting to sell between 60,000 and 70,000 complete AI servers, it cannot afford to make a significant mistake that would cause it to lose the confidence of its customers and the lawsuits that would follow.\nAnother reason that Nvidia can take its time to launch its next-generation GPUs is that it stands alone in the data center GPU market, having owned 98% of the market in 2023. Even if AMD manages to produce a competing AI product that performs as well as Blackwell, reaching market share parity with Nvidia will take some time.\nTeam Green cannot rest on its laurels, though, as even its biggest customers, like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, are investing in hardware research to build their own AI products in-house. It means that Nvidia must ensure that it will deliver Blackwell to customers within the expected time frame to retain its lead as one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n"

        "Text": "By Chibuike Oguh and Lawrence White\nNEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Global equity markets eased while the U.S. dollar rebounded on Wednesday, and then chipmaker Nvidia's better-than-expected results failed to impress some investors and the company's stock fell 3% in extended trading.\nWall Street's main indexes finished lower, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.39% to 41,091.42, the S&P 500 lost 0.60% to 5,592.18 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.12% to 17,556.03.\nEurope's benchmark STOXX index climbed 0.33% while Japanese stocks closed 0.22% higher. MSCI's gauge of all stocks across the globe was 0.42% lower at 827.32.\nNvidia's third-quarter revenue forecast of $32.5 billion surpassed Wall Street estimates after markets closed. The report still failed to impress the most bullish investors who have driven a dizzying rally in its shares as they bet billions on the future of generative artificial intelligence. Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company fell 3% in extended trading.\nNvidia's stock price is up some 3,000% since 2019 and with a market capitalisation of $3 trillion, a move in its share price affects the broader market.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\nWall Street analysts are urging investors to take advantage of the recent pullback in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares. Despite the AI giant\u2019s quarterly forecast falling short of the lofty expectations set by investors, who have driven a massive rally in its stock on hopes for generative AI, analysts remain bullish.\nNvidia's shares dropped more than 6% on Thursday after the fiscal Q2 report was released. While the company reported significant growth and profit, the results were viewed as mixed, as revenue and gross margin projections didn\u2019t surpass Wall Street's lofty targets as they had in previous quarters.\nUBS analysts, however, believe investors should \u201cbuy the pullback,\u201d noting that key indicators for Nvidia remain bullish. The bank specifically pointed to the surge in Nvidia\u2019s purchase commitments and supply obligations, describing this as \u201cthe most important metric we watch and a harbinger of future growth.\u201d\nUBS analysts also expressed confidence in Nvidia's margins, stating they are not concerned about gross margins and expect data center margins to stay consistent through the Blackwell cycle, mirroring the stability seen during the Hopper cycle.\nSimilarly, Bank of America analysts reiterated their Buy rating on Nvidia stock following the report and raised the target price from $150 to $165.\nBofA acknowledged that the stock is \u201clikely to be volatile\u201d in the near term due to Nvidia\u2019s projections missing elevated expectations, and noted that rising Blackwell ramp costs could impact Q3 margins.\nNonetheless, BofA remains confident in Nvidia\u2019s long-term prospects, stressing that they \u201ccontinue to believe in NVDA\u2019s unique growth opportunity, execution and dominant 80%+ share as generative AI deployments are still in their first 1-1.5 years of what is at least a 3-4 year upfront investment cycle.\u201d\n\u201cAI deployment remains a mission-critical imperative for global cloud and enterprise customers, with NVDA providing the best turnkey model.\u201d\nCiti analysts have elevated Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to their \u201ctop AI pick\u201d for 2025, surpassing both Nvidia and Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET). This move comes as Apple gears up to unveil its iPhone 16 lineup at the \u201cIt\u2019s Glowtime\u201d product event on September 9th.\nAt the event, Apple is expected to introduce several key updates, including A18 chips utilizing the N3E process with an enhanced neural engine, improved camera and microphone features, and an upgraded modem for the Pro models.\n\u201cApple\u2019s September event is generally all about hardware updates, but we believe the company will put a lot of focus on how the hardware updates for the iPhone 16 family can better support its Apple Intelligence features that are expected to roll out officially later in the fall,\u201d Citi analysts remarked.\nLooking ahead, Citi expects a major refresh with the iPhone 17 next year, with AI features gradually being introduced over the coming year. This phased rollout is expected to give developers time to create apps and allow Apple to build customer recognition.\nCiti projects iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 unit sales to reach 85 million and 92 million in calendar years 2024 and 2025, respectively. Total iPhone units are expected to hit 228 million in 2024 and 241 million in 2025.\nThe analysts also highlighted that \u201cAAPL stock on average outperformed the broader market since 2016 by 5%-6% over the period from June-quarter earnings date into the September iPhone release date.\u201d\nInvestors should be more concerned about the potential bursting of the AI bubble than a looming U.S. or global recession, according to strategists at BCA Research. The firm\u2019s analysis suggests that the risks associated with the rapidly growing AI sector are more serious than those posed by broader economic downturns.\n\"When bubbles burst, the investment priority is to steer well clear of the bursting bubble plus sectors, regions, and countries heavily exposed to it.\" This implies that regardless of whether a recession follows the collapse of the bubble, the primary focus should be on avoiding the areas most impacted by the fallout.\nIn line with this, BCA Research advises investors to underweight U.S. tech and quasi-tech sectors, which are closely tied to the AI boom, and to reduce their exposure to U.S. equities within a global portfolio.\n\"Investors should worry much less about a U.S. or global recession than they should worry about the bubble in anything AI-related,\u201d BCA noted.\nWith the AI sector continuing to attract significant attention and capital, BCA warns that the potential for a sharp correction poses a noteworthy threat.\nWilliam Blair has initiated research coverage of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) with an Outperform (Buy) rating, primarily driven by the underappreciated potential of Tesla's energy storage business.\nThe firm believes that Tesla Energy, particularly its Megapack and Powerwall products, could emerge as a significant growth driver, especially as expectations for the electric vehicle (EV) segment moderate in the near term.\n\u201cWe view Tesla Energy as the most underappreciated component of the Tesla story and expect the narrative will shift toward the energy storage business in light of tempered EV expectations in the near term.\"\nThe analysts highlight three key factors that make Tesla's energy storage business a compelling investment: the need for grid stabilization, the expansion of data centers, and the integration of renewable energy sources.\nThese aspects, alongside Tesla's broader automotive business and emerging opportunities in AI, robotaxis, and robotics, position the company as a technology leader with what William Blair describes as an \"Apple-esque ecosystem for the future of energy.\"\n\"Energy is the foundation for life, an abundance or lack of which determines how far society can reach on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\"\nTesla's approach to energy, through its more efficient EVs, energy storage solutions, and innovations like robotaxis and humanoid robots, aims to revolutionize how energy is created, stored, and utilized, with broad societal implications.\nWhile Tesla's current valuation may appear high by traditional metrics, William Blair argues that this premium is justified.\n\"Using traditional comparable analysis with auto or even tech, we understand the difficulty justifying the valuation, but in our opinion, this misunderstands the Tesla story.\"\nThey believe that the halo effect created by Elon Musk, the company\u2019s culture of first principles, and its technological advantages warrant the valuation premium.\nCiti analysts maintained their Buy rating on Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) stock with a $91 price target, based on an 18% higher-than-consensus CY25 earnings per share (EPS) following the July-quarter results.\nThe investment bank sees Marvell capitalizing on strong AI investments to rapidly expand its AI ASIC business, with four AI ASIC projects in the pipeline\u2014two currently ramping up, one expected in 2025, and another in 2026.\nMoreover, Citi is adding a Positive Catalyst Watch ahead of next week's Technology Conference, where Marvell's CEO Matt Murphy will participate in a fireside chat.\n\"We expect management to sound bullish on AI growth exceeding prior 2024/25 AI sales targets and all non-AI end markets to recover in 2H24,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\"MRVL stock typically outperforms when all its end markets move in the same direction,\u201d they added.\nRelated Articles\n5 big analyst AI moves: \u2018Buy Nvidia pullback,\u2019 Apple named Top AI Pick\nMorgan Stanley updated its Dividend Equity Portfolio, dropped this big tech name\nWhat are implications of potential PlayStation 5 Pro launch on Sony's financials\n"

This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit percentage year-over-year top-line growth.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The blockbuster results were driven by incredible demand for NVIDIA\u2019s electric circuits, known as graphics processing units (GPUs), and data centers. Data Center revenues jumped 154% year over year to $26.3 billion, buoyed by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform.\nNVIDIA is the world leader in AI chip design and software, controlling between 80% and 95% of the market, according to Reuters. It has been key to the current AI trade on Wall Street, with almost half of its revenues tied directly to tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Meta (META).The AI chipmaker expects shipments of its current Hopper chips to \"increase\" in the second half of the year. CEO Jensen Huang also said NVIDIA expects the data center business to grow \"quite significantly next year,\" and that \"Blackwell is going to be a complete game changer for the industry\" despite concerns over its production delays that could push back deliveries and impact its revenues in the next few quarters. NVIDIA expects \"several billion dollars\" from Blackwell sales as production ramps up in the fourth quarter (read: 5 Technology ETFs at the Forefront of the August Rebound).\u00a0For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the graphics chipmaker expects revenues of around $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 17 Trending AI Stocks According to Latest News And Analyst Ratings.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nOne of the biggest breakthroughs of artificial intelligence in the past few years has been the advances in natural language processing. These AI models in language are now making their way into the business world and the society at large. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Expert economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani recently wrote in a report that the ability of AI tools to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects.\nSome of these macro factors are more discernible in the form of numbers. A recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models (read more about these firms by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To) compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\nThis exciting phase in the world of technology has ushered in a new boom for the world economy, previously plagued by inflation concerns, geopolitical conflicts, and stagnating demand figures. The bullish sentiment on AI needs to be balanced with caution. In the long run, investors should prepare themselves for significant changes to how the world works as AI could automate nearly 300 million jobs. In previous cycles of automation, new jobs and opportunities have risen to replace this. Recognizing these opportunities (read more about them by accessing 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave) ahead of the time could go a long way towards balancing the risk profiles of growth-heavy portfolios. Recent research suggests that 60% of the workforce presently was occupied in positions that did not exist just half a century ago, lending credence to claims that over 80% of employment growth since the time can be explained by tech-driven innovation.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 186\u00a0\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The stock has been hit recently amid a broader selloff in the tech sector and reports of delays in the production of new AI chips branded Blackwell. However, the bigger picture remains rosy. The company has taken measures to ease investor concerns on the new chip, AI labs of the firm have been upsizing and lengthening their instance commitments, and enterprises are rapidly growing as a proportion of the demand mix. All these indicators point towards a bullish outlook for the AI giant.\nAnalysts led by Timothy Arcuri at investment advisory UBS have also recently backed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to emerge from the Blackwell troubles unscathed, reiterating a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $150. Arcuri and his team noted that initial Blackwell customer volume shipments were only delayed four to six weeks at most, putting them at the very end of January 2025. This delay, per the team, was likely to be filled in large by customers taking more H200 chips due to very short lead times.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our of the trending AI stocks according to latest news and analyst ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's no question about it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the most closely watched stock of the AI boom.\nIt's easy to see why. Nvidia has added more than $2 trillion in market value since the start of 2023, entering an exclusive echelon of the world's most valuable companies shared only with Apple and Microsoft.\nHowever, in addition to the company's own success in leading the AI chip revolution, it also carries a small investment portfolio, and a company as influential as Nvidia has the potential to move the needle with its stock purchases. Its biggest holding is Arm Holdings, the CPU architecture specialist that Nvidia works closely with. When it purchased shares of Soundhound AI in the first quarter, shares of that stock surged on the news.\nIn the second quarter, Nvidia bought just one stock, Serve Robotics (NASDAQ: SERV), a maker of food delivery robots that operate in public spaces. The stock jumped 9.6% on high-volume trading when news broke that Nvidia purchased 3.7 million shares in the second quarter, worth roughly $4.3 million today, or 10% of the company's market value.\nServe Robotics is a small AI and robotics company founded in 2021 that finished 2023 with just 67 employees. CEO Ali Kashani was previously a vice president at Postmates, an on-demand food delivery platform acquired by Uber (NYSE: UBER). Prior to that, he was the co-founder and chief technology officer at a smart home technology acquired by Generac, a maker of generators.\nYou may have seen Serve Robotics' autonomous delivery vehicles on the street. Uber Eats partnered with the company to test out delivery by robot in Los Angeles, and Serve also counts companies such as Yum! Brands' Pizza Hut, Shake Shack, and 7-Eleven as customers. In addition to being a major customer, Uber is also an investor in the company.\nServe Robotics is essentially just a development-stage company at this point. It reported $468,375 in revenue in the second quarter, but that was up 655% from the quarter a year ago.\nThe company had 48 \"daily active robots\" in the second quarter, meaning that was the average number of robots performing daily deliveries, more than doubling from 23 in the quarter the year before.\nServe also reported a $9.1 million operating loss in the quarter, as it's spending most of its money on research and development. The company finished the quarter with $28.8 million in cash and $4.3 million in total liabilities after raising $40 million in its second-quarter IPO.\nIt's aiming to deploy at least 250 more robots in Los Angeles by the end of the first quarter of next year. It also expects to have 2,000 robots active with Uber Eats by the end of 2025, which it said would generate $60 million to $80 million in annual revenue.\nAt this point, Serve Robotics is a high-risk/high-reward type of stock. With less than $1 million in quarterly revenue, the company can't really be judged by its financials, but robotics, including delivery robots, is an emerging industry. The addressable market seems large as there's a clear financial incentive for a company like Uber to make robotic food delivery work as it would eliminate the existing labor costs.\nHaving both Uber and Nvidia, the leading ride-sharing platform and chipmaker, as investors is also a credit to the company, and those relationships should give the company a competitive advantage over other robotics. Potentially, it will give Serve preferred access to Nvidia chips and technology and make room for more collaborations with Uber.\nWith those relationships and a leading position in an emerging technology, Serve Robotics has a lot of upside potential. Taking a small position in the stock right now would make sense for risk-tolerant investors looking to round out their AI stock holdings.\nBefore you buy stock in Serve Robotics, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Serve Robotics wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) investors saw a roller-coaster ride ahead of its Q2 earnings release in August. Its share price dropped below $100 on August 5, rebounded, and went up for six consecutive days from the 12th to the 19th. Nvidia traded at around $128 on August 21.\nNvidia\u2019s early-month plunge was partly due to the global market turmoil after the yen-carry trade and a potential chip delivery delay caused by a design flaw in the Blackwell architecture.\nThe chip giant remains the AI industry leader, with an 80% market share in AI processors. But rivals like AMD are picking up the pace.\nOn August 19, AMD announced a 5 billion acquisition of ZT Systems to boost its GPU sales. Nvidia stock lost 2% on the next trading day. GPUs are hardware specialized in performing the matrix calculations required by AI processing.\nRelated: Analysts reset AMD stock outlooks after AI acquisition\nNvidia will post its fiscal Q2 earnings on August 28. Whatever the results, they will mark a key weather vane for the AI and the semiconductor industry. The earnings reports from its peer chip makers can be a good reference for earnings prediction and future stock price movements.\nThe No. 2 market player, AMD, delivered strong Q2 earnings on July 30, exceeding analysts' expectations for both revenue and profits. Revenue rose 9% to $5.84 billion, while earnings increased by 19% to 69 cents a share. It also sees robust AI demand ahead.\nBut Intel tumbled on an earnings miss.

Earnings are out on Aug. 28 after the close of trading, and it could mean big things for the AI trade as Morning Brief co-host Seana Smith points out.\nEvery day, I get to the office by 4:20 a.m. and turn on some software we use to track which stories and ticker pages are garnering the most interest from Yahoo Finance readers. Every single day, one of the most actively viewed pages on our platform is for Nvidia.\nThe world could be on the cusp of an alien attack, and I fancy people will still be hitting refresh on the Nvidia ticker page. Investors have become absolutely obsessed with a company they had never even heard of two years ago.\nI can't blame them.\nNvidia's stock is up 170% in the past year. Nvidia's stock is up 3,000% in the past five years.\nThese are insane gains, the type that lure in the less-experienced investor hoping to retire early.\nAnd Nvidia's story is surprisingly easy to grasp despite the company's incredibly complicated business. Nvidia makes the best artificial intelligence chips in a world being upheaved by AI. Simple. No one is even close to Nvidia in terms of AI chip performance and forward-looking demand.\nI do want to caution that the setup on Nvidia going into the quarterly report is a little different this go around. While the Street is staying super bullish on Nvidia heading into the print, they are a touch cautious amid reported shipment delays for Nvidia's powerful new AI chip Blackwell.\nThere is good reason for the bullishness based on a host of recent signals from earnings reports:\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) just cited strong AI demand when it reported.\nAMD (AMD) recently lifted its sales for data center chips for the third time in a year.\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) cited strong demand for its liquid cooling solutions.\nNvidia chip customer Meta (META) just raised its capital expenditures guidance for 2024 and 2025 by billions.\n\"We expect Nvidia to report beat/raise results, in which upside will be driven by strong demand for Hopper GPUs. Given the Blackwell delay, we believe Nvidia will prioritize the ramp of B200 for hyperscalers and has effectively canceled B100, which will be replaced with a lower cost/performance GPU (B200A) targeted at enterprise customers,\" Keybanc analyst John Vinh said in a client note.\nFor Nvidia's report to be embraced, I think investors need to see at least two things:\nNvidia must convey that reported Blackwell shipment delays aren't a structural issue.\nNvidia must show strong quarter-over-quarter sales growth in its data center business.\nIf this happens, it could shake off a few bears and set the table for what EMJ Capital founder and tech investor Eric Jackson told me on the Opening Bid podcast.\n\"I'm saying [Nvidia's value] could double again between now and the end of the year,\" Jackson said.\nTo put that in perspective, Jackson thinks Nvidia's market cap could hit $6 trillion by year-end from $3.2 trillion or so currently.\nJackson reasons the company stands to get there by delivering a very, very strong earnings report this week or in November (or both) that shows off continuing demand for H100 and H200 chips while teeing up the potential of its new AI-focused Blackwell chips.\nRest up. It's going to be a busy week ahead.\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on my Opening Bid podcast.

        "Text": "After tumbling yesterday, shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were heading south again today. Once again, weak economic data was the culprit, triggering another broad market sell-off.\nThis morning, the Bureau of Labr Statistics reported that the unemployment rate jumped from 4.1% to 4.3% in July, and new jobs fell to just 114,000. The news has sparked fears that the economy could be headed for a recession and that the Federal Reserve should have lowered interest rates at its meeting on Wednesday.\nNvidia was down as much as 7.2% this morning, though the stock recouped some of those losses and was down 4% in afternoon trading on Friday, slightly worse than the Nasdaq Composite, which fell 3%.\nNvidia has led the market rally for the last year and a half as the champion of the AI boom. Its hardware has become essential to run the data centers that provide computing power for AI models like ChatGPT and the rush of other AI tools coming on the market.\nThe company's own business continues to grow at a breakneck pace, but investors are starting to question valuations in AI stocks, including Nvidia's, which had added more than $3 trillion in market value in little more than a year at one point. A gain of that size is unprecedented.\nNow, in addition to concerns about Nvidia's valuation, investors seem to have doubts about the strength of the economy, and rising unemployment could trigger a recession.\nAn economic downturn would likely hit the AI stock sector hard since Nvidia and its peers still trade at pricey valuations, and semiconductors are a cyclical industry. If customers slam on the brakes, the industry is going to be in trouble.\nIt's impossible to predict short-term movements for individual stocks or even the stock market as a whole, and Nvidia has been highly volatile lately. After falling 7% on Tuesday, the stock surged 13% on Wednesday in sympathy with strong results from rival AMD. In other words, the stock can turn on a dime if the news changes.\nInvestors should expect the volatility to continue, and the stock could fall significantly further, though that will depend on economic data and the company's earnings report at the end of the month.\nNvidia's momentum as a business won't be undone easily. Tech titans like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have banged the drum on AI again this earnings season, saying it's essential to stay ahead of the AI curve, and that getting left behind is a greater risk.\nNvidia likely has several more quarters of strong growth in front of it, but a recession could upset that. At this point, keeping some cash available to take advantage of ongoing dips on the stock seems like a good strategy. While the economy could falter, Nvidia's leadership in AI hardware looks unshakable.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  SARAH PARVINI ",
        "Text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Nvidia may have exceeded Wall Street estimates as its profit jumped \u2014 buffeted by the chipmaking dominance that has cemented Nvidia\u2019s place as the poster child of the artificial intelligence boom \u2014 but investors seemed less than impressed.\nThe company reported a net income of to $16.6 billion. Adjusted for one-time items, net income was $16.95 billion. Revenue rose to $30 billion, up 122% from a year ago and 15% from the previous quarter.\nBy comparison, S&P 500 companies overall are expected to deliver just 5% growth in revenue for the quarter, according to FactSet. Still, Nvidia shares slipped nearly 4% in after-hours trading.\nRyan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, said that despite growing revenue \u201cit appears the bar was just set a tad too high this earnings season.\u201d\n\u201cDeath, taxes, and NVDA beats on earnings are three things you can bank on,\u201d Detrick said. \u201cHere\u2019s the issue. The size of the beat this time was much smaller than we\u2019ve been seeing. Even future guidance was raised, but again not by the tune from previous quarters.\u201d\nThe company reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents per share, up from 27 cents a year ago. Nvidia said it expects third quarter revenue to grow to $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%.\nNvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company's chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.\n\u201cThe people who are investing in Nvidia infrastructure are getting returns on it right away,\u201d Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said on a call with analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s the best ROI infrastructure, computing infrastructure investment you can make today.\u201d\nDemand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia\u2019s specialized chips over the last year. In June, Nvidia briefly rose to become the most valuable company in the S&P 500. The company is now worth over $3 trillion.\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said during the analyst call that the company is planning to increase production of its Blackwell AI chips beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing through fiscal 2026. Kress said Nvidia expects several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue in the fourth quarter, with shipments of its Hopper graphics processor unit, or GPU, expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Television, Huang said the company will \u201chave a great next year as well.\u201d\nThrough the year\u2019s first six months, Nvidia\u2019s stock price soared nearly 150%. At that point, it was trading at a little more than 100 times the company\u2019s earnings over the prior 12 months. That\u2019s much more expensive than it\u2019s been historically and than the S&P 500 in general. That's why analysts warn of a selloff if Wall Street sees any indication that AI demand is waning.\nDan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, called the earnings part of a \u201chistoric, meteoric rise from Nvidia and the godfather of AI, Jensen (Huang).\u201d Investors, Ives added, are picking apart \u201crobust numbers\u201d and trying to find holes in them. Although Nvidia said it estimates about $32.5 billion in revenue in the third fiscal quarter, some analysts expected a slightly higher figure, he said.\n\u201cI view it as kind of like splitting hairs,\u201d Ives said. The demand for AI technology is only accelerating, he added, echoing Huang's previous statements that the world is in the midst of the next industrial revolution.\n\u201cThis is the most watched earnings \u2014 not just in tech, but in the market, in many years,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors will initially overreact to any sort of short-lived weakness. But I believe this actually put more fuel into the tank of the bull market.\u201d\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nTech stocks are continuing to decline amid fears the Fed is taking too long to begin interest rate cuts, stoked by the latest jobs data that showed unemployment is rising. However, some analysts believe the latest decline in AI stocks is part of a normal market rotation and gives investors an opportunity to buy. While talking to CNBC in a latest program, Michael Landsberg of Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth said that the latest decline is a \u201clittle bit of a reset, obviously.\u201d The analyst said that AI stocks had a \u201cgreat run\u201d and the latest pullback is a \u201ctypical process\u201d of market rotation.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we are not positive longer term on AI but when you have big runs like that that\u2019s why you rebalance portfolios to keep the risk in check,\u201d Landsberg said.\nAsked if the AI bubble has popped and this is the end of the AI hype, the analyst said \u201cabsolutely not\u201d and called the recent pullback \u201cdeceleration\u201d from growth and \u201cnormalization.\u201d\nLandsberg said that the earnings season will \u201cseparate the wheat from the chaff\u201d and believes major tech companies will still drive earnings in the future.\nFor this article, we scanned the latest AI news, earnings, and analyst ratings and picked the 10 biggest stocks moving on these developments. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\u201cVisibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,\u201d the firm said.\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company\u2019s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won\u2019t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has \u201ctriggered a mechanical sell signal\u201d based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\nNYU professor and valuation guru Aswath Damodoran has also been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has \u201cno idea what I\u2019m talking about\u201d or it\u2019s the market that just does not understand.\nAswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the \u201cdriving seat\u201d of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won\u2019t be as easy as the market assumes.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).\u201d\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The company's share price has rocketed 155% higher across 2024's trading, and the company continues to have an outsize impact on valuation trends in the AI space and the market at large.\nIn a note published last Friday, Evercore ISI maintained a buy rating on Nvidia stock and raised its price target from $145 per share to $150 per share. Based on the stock's price of roughly $127 per share as I write this, the new price target suggests potential upside of roughly 18%. Should investors take the firm's advice and buy Nvidia stock right now?\nCiting strong demand from hyperscale cloud customers including Microsoft and Meta Platforms, Evercore thinks that Nvidia is poised to continue serving up strong performance. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become foundational hardware for advanced AI training and inference applications, and the firm's analysts anticipate that the AI hardware leader will continue to benefit from demand trends in the second half of the year.\nWhile some investors and analysts have wondered whether AI-related hardware demand may be poised to level off and recede in the not-too-distant future, there are signs that Nvidia is on track to prove the doubters wrong. In addition to strong demand from hyperscalers, the company is likely in the early stages of seeing purchases from government customers ramp up. The company also has some positive, hardware-level catalysts on the horizon.\nWith the upcoming launch of its next-generation Blackwell processors, Nvidia is poised to introduce a major new sales driver.

        "Text": "Nvidia stock is in a \u201cbubble\u201d and its rally is being driven by an \u201coverhyped\u201d AI technology, hedge fund Elliott Management has told investors in a letter seen by the Financial Times.\nThe hedge fund, which manages around $70 billion in assets, reportedly said that mega-cap tech stocks including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are in \u201cbubble land,\u201d voicing skepticism that the high-volume purchases of Nvidia's graphics processing units by Big Tech companies will continue.\nElliot noted that AI is \u201coverhyped with many applications not ready for prime time,\" the FT's report says.\nIt believes that many touted AI applications are \u201cnever going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.\u201d\nThe asset manager\u2019s remarks come as chip stocks, which have surged due to investor excitement over generative AI, have recently stumbled amid doubts about sustained investment by large companies.\nNvidia, a key player in the market for processors essential for building AI systems like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, has seen major investments from technology giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which have been spending billions on AI infrastructure.\nHowever, despite these investments, many of Nvidia\u2019s significant clients are developing their own competing chips.\nNvidia\u2019s stock has fallen by over 20% since late June, when it temporarily became the world\u2019s largest company with a market capitalization exceeding $3.3 trillion, amid growing concerns about the sustainability of AI investments and the slowing U.S. economy. Still, the chipmaker\u2019s shares remain up about 120% this year and have increased more than 600% since the start of 2023.\nIn the client letter, Elliott mentioned that it had largely avoided what it described as bubble stocks, including those in the Magnificent Seven.\nRegulatory filings indicate that Elliott held a small position in Nvidia, valued at approximately $4.5 million at the end of March, although it is unclear for how long it held this position.\nAccording to the report, the hedge fund has also been cautious about shorting high-flying technology stocks, noting that such a strategy could be \u201csuicidal.\"\nElliott also emphasized that AI has yet to deliver the significant productivity boost that was promised. It remarked that there are \u201cfew real uses\u201d for AI at this stage, beyond \u201csummarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding.\u201d\nThe letter concluded that AI, so far, is essentially software that has not provided \u201cvalue commensurate with the hype.\u201d The current bubble could burst if Nvidia reported poor financial results and thereby \u201cbreaks the spell.\u201d\nRelated Articles\nHedge fund Elliott says AI is 'overhyped', Nvidia stock 'a bubble'\nProbability of 50 bps rate cut more than doubled after payroll data\nAmazon says consumers cautious, forecasts revenue below Wall Street targets\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia: Long-Term Entry Point, but Potential Short-Term Downside",
        "Author": "  Oliver Rodzianko ",
        "Text": "Many investors were questioning whether Nvidia Corp.'s (NASDAQ:NVDA) valuation was sustainable a month ago. My sentiment was that a correction was due, and this has already happened.\nDespite the long-term growth outlook for the company remaining strong, there is a considerable likelihood of further downside, presenting an undervaluation for the stock over the next six to 12 months. As a result of this analysis, Nvidia is currently a long-term buy but could potentially become a strong buy in 2025 if the stock drops further and becomes undervalued.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nDespite Nvidia's recent $900 billion market value decline, major tech companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) continue to invest heavily in artificial intelligence infrastructure, which is crucial to its long-term growth sustenance. That being said, there is now growing consensus that the AI capex is not sustainable, including questions arising related to the return on investment in the short to medium term. This is likely to induce periods of market panic and open up undervaluations among major AI companies. Nonetheless, the AI infrastructure market could reach a trillion dollars of investment over the next five years if current trends continue.\nNvidia is likely to continue to capitalize on rapid advancements in AI and machine learning, impacting robotics, including the integration of generative AI for intuitive robot programming, predictive maintenance and the rise of collaborative robots working alongside humans. The company is actively supporting these developments through its Isaac robotics platform, which is facilitating the adoption of AI-enabled autonomous machines by industry leaders. I believe this is going to be the next big wave for Nvidia's growth when AI meets the physical world more acutely.\nDespite my bullishness, Nvidia is a chip company, and semiconductor stocks are usually cyclical. I estimate that its position in the long-term AI boom will be no different, with periods of high growth and periods of lower growth. The company's growth over the past two years has been fueled by the surge in AI, but as the market matures and the bulk of the data center buildout is fulfilled, it is likely to meet slower growth in data center GPU sales. This is why my long-term thesis related to robotics is of paramount importance for investors buying in at the present valuation, as it could help to sustain Nvidia's growth somewhat.\nThe GF Value Line currently shows Nvidia to be modestly overvalued and, while I think this is accurate, I also believe the market could drive the stock into undervalued territory based on bearish sentiment in the market that could grow surrounding AI momentarily.\nNvidia currently has a forward price-earnings ratio of 45.50, which is reasonable to me despite a high trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio of 68. The price-sales ratio of 36.30 is far higher than its 10-year median of 13.40. I believe the price-sales ratio is one of the biggest concerns with the company's valuation, which is worth noting and explains why there is some likelihood of further downside to come based on sentiment factors moving into 2026 when fundamental growth rates are estimated by Wall Street to be lower.\nTo outline this more specifically, Wall Street predicts Nvidia will achieve 110% earnings per share growth in 2025, but only 38% in 2026. Therefore, a sentiment shift is definitely warranted. While a correction down 15% may seem to fulfill this sentiment shift, the market could potentially continue to price the stock lower over the coming quarters.\nA one-year price target based on the GF Value Line would be roughly $150. However, I think there is a significant chance of this not being achieved due to the market sentiment factors I outlined above. I believe the price target of $200 at the calendar 2027 start, also indicated by the GF Value chart, is, in practice, more likely to be achieved than the calendar 2026 start price target of $175.\nIn other words, I think the probability of significant volatility ahead is likely despite good fundamental growth continuing. As a result, Nvidia is a buy based on a medium-term horizon, but should be held at a small allocation to mitigate the downside risk of sentiment and valuation factors.\nDespite the potential in robotics that will help Nvidia sustain growth after the initial AI infrastructure build-out, the robotics market is not expected to be as large as the AI market (at least initially). That being said, AI's occurrence was largely unpredicted by most people and large growth forecasts appeared quickly. Therefore, the company has the potential to position itself to capitalize on what could be massive growth in robotics, which is currently potentially underestimated by analysts as most of the focus is on AI. At present, the robotics market could be worth $200 billion by 2033, based on a report from GlobalData, but AI is expected to achieve a trillion-dollar investment. Therefore, the difference between both industries in the consensus view is currently stark. It is also worth noting that AI is the foundation of robotics, as well as other information-based automation, like SaaS enhancements; this is fundamental to why AI is a much larger industry than robotics.\nThe AI market is now also becoming diverse and saturated by more players. AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) MI300X chip is targeted at large language model training and claims to outperform Nvidia's offerings in certain aspects. Cerebras is introducing new architectures, such as wafer-scale engines, that offer high memory bandwidth, which is gaining traction in pharmaceutical research and large language models. Furthermore, major cloud service providers, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are developing their AI chips for internal use, potentially reducing reliance on Nvidia's products. AMD and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are part of the UXL foundation, which is aiming to create free alternatives to the company's CUDA software ecosystem, a key competitive advantage for Nvidia.\nOverall, the near-term future for the stock looks quite unpredictable and unstable, in my opinion. Some analysts are suggesting Nvidia could encounter a Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) moment from the year 2000 when its stock dropped dramatically in price after the dot-com boom. Despite the possibility of this, I do not think the decline will be as pronounced. As I mentioned, I think Nvidia could continue to decline in price in the short term but also potentially reach new highs within a couple of years as ity capitalizes on robotics trends and continued AI capital expenditures. There is likely to be a contraction in valuation multiples, but a forward earnings multiple of 45 does not seem unreasonably high to me. The AI infrastructure build-out is much more tangible in many respects than the dot-com boom was. As a result, Nvidia is a buy at these levels, but likely a strong buy if the price falls further over the next few quarters.\nNvidia posts its second-quarter earnings on Aug. 28. If the company beats expectations and raises its guidance, this could be an inflection point that sees its shares climb higher. On the other hand, if the company reports an earnings miss and lowers guidance, I believe the opposite could happen and the stock could fall in price on fears of downward momentum and further contraction in fundamental growth expectations to come.\nThat being said, the major players have all said that they are scaling their AI infrastructure investments and expect the capex in fiscal 2025 to be higher than in 2024. This bodes well for Nvidia this year, in my opinion, and I am more bullish than bearish on the stock in the near term. Despite what happens with earnings, I think it is a long-term buy.\nNvidia is currently in buy rating territory, but there is the potential for further downside to occur. Despite this, the GF Value Line indicates the stock is currently only modestly overvalued. As of the time of writing, shares fell 19% from all-time highs before regaining approximately 10% over the past five days.\nI am bullish on Nvidia, but I also think the stock could face downside volatility over the next several quarters. As a result of this and the high valuation, I am still not buying the stock yet, but I might if it becomes undervalued after a potentially unjustified sell-off based on short-term sentiment factors.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the market's most visible and influential battleground stock. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader posted second-quarter results after the market closed on Aug. 28 and posted performance that crushed Wall Street's targets. The business recorded non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $0.68 on sales of $30 billion in the period, cruising past the average analyst estimate for per-share earnings of $0.64 on revenue of $28.7 billion.\nBut despite substantial sales and earnings beats in the quarter, Nvidia stock still lost ground following the report. With the company's share price losing ground on the heels of a blockbuster Q2 report, it's not unreasonable to wonder whether the red-hot AI leader may have finally hit its valuation peak.\nWhile the stock could continue to see some post-earnings valuation volatility, there's a good reason to think the stock can bounce back and continue climbing higher.\nThanks to AI-driven demand for the company's most advanced processors, Nvidia has been posting fantastic gross margins. The chart below tracks the business' gross margin over a three-year period concluding at the first quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year, which ended April 28, 2024.\nWith its recent report, Nvidia showed that it had recorded a gross margin of 75.1% in Q2 and also guided for a margin of 74.4% in fiscal Q3. For the full-year period, the company expects its gross margin percentage to be in the mid-70s. Based on the company's recent results and forecast, it looks like prices for its AI processors are coming down -- but not by much.\nNvidia's current top-of-the-line graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerators are still showing very strong pricing power, and large tech companies are still buying hardware to improve their AI infrastructure. Selling prices for the company's current GPUs for advanced data center applications will likely continue to decline, but the AI frontrunner is gearing up to release its next major chip platform.\nNvidia has said that manufacturing of its next-generation Blackwell chips will ramp up in the fourth quarter, and it appears that the new processors are poised for release late in 2024 or early in 2025. With the company's current processors demonstrating resilient pricing power and a major leap forward in GPU technology on the horizon, the bull case for the stock remains intact.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Here\u2019s what to look for.\nNvidia beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 6% last quarter, reporting revenues of $26.04 billion, up 262% year on year. It was an exceptional quarter for the company, with a significant improvement in its gross margin and an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates.\nIs Nvidia a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Nvidia\u2019s revenue to grow 113% year on year to $28.73 billion, improving from the 101% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.64 per share.\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Nvidia has a history of exceeding Wall Street\u2019s expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years by 7.6% on average.\nLooking at Nvidia\u2019s peers in the processors and graphics chips segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Qorvo delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 36.2%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 4.1%, and Qualcomm reported revenues up 11.1%, topping estimates by 1.9%. Qorvo\u2019s stock price was unchanged after the results, while Qualcomm was down 9.3%.\nRead our full analysis of Qorvo\u2019s results here and Qualcomm\u2019s results here.\nGrowth stocks have seen elevated volatility as investors debate the Fed\u2019s monetary policy, and while some of the processors and graphics chips stocks have fared somewhat better, they have not been spared, with share prices down 3.5% on average over the last month. Nvidia is up 13.4% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $143.1 (compared to the current share price of $126.57).\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), AT&T Inc. (T) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), as well as two micro-cap stocks Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (SPLP) and Natural Resource Partners L.P. (NRP). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>NVIDIA shares have lost some ground following the beat-and-raise quarterly release on Wednesday, August 28th, with market participants seemingly shrugging the company's raised guidance. But this lack of stock market follow through for the shares could very well be a reflection of the stock's impressive gains over the past year rather than a comment on underlying busines trends. \nThe company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\u00a0A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\u00a0However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds. The United States and China\u2019s tit-for-tat trade war is also a major concern.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of AT&T have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the year-to-date period (+23.4% vs. +21.7%). The company is expected to benefit from an integrated fiber expansion strategy that improves broadband connectivity, while steady 5G deployments are likely to boost end-user experience. The deployment of O-RAN architecture is likely to offer more flexibility, lower costs and monetize the network to reduce huge debt burden.\u00a0With a customer-centric business model, AT&T is witnessing healthy momentum in its postpaid wireless business with a lower churn rate and increased adoption of higher-tier unlimited plans. However, lower demand for legacy voice and data services is affecting revenues in the Business Wireline vertical.\u00a0Declining Mobility equipment sales are a concern. Fierce competition in a saturated wireless market will likely strain margins. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome while high debt burden remains a perennial problem.(You can read the full research report on AT&T here >>>)Lockheed Martin shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+29.1% vs. +1.9%). The company\u2019s broad product offerings allow it to secure major defense contracts, which in turn boosts its backlog count. Lockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs.\u00a0The solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Its products also witness a strong international demand from the countries like Germany, Taiwan, Japan and Australia. Meanwhile, the company also holds a strong solvency position.\u00a0However, Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products that may affect its results. Shortage of skilled labor may adversely impact the company\u2019s operating results. The sanctions imposed by China on Lockheed might also affect its business.(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here >>>)Shares of Steel Partners\u2019 have declined -2.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Diversified Operations industry\u2019s decline of -7%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $795.34 million reported strong financial results in second-quarter 2024, with revenues growing 6.4% year over year to $533.2 million and a 113.2% surge in net income to $124.9 million.Revenues for the six months ended Jun 30, 2024 also increased by 6.7% to $1 billion. This growth reflects the company's effective diversification across its industrial and financial services segments. SPLP's operational efficiency is highlighted by a 15.7% adjusted EBITDA margin, up from 14.7% in second-quarter 2023.\u00a0Steel Partners\u2019 balance sheet is robust, with $256.4 million in cash and a $112-million debt reduction in the first half of 2024, enhancing financial stability. Investments in the Supply Chain segment, which saw 192% in revenues for the six months ended Jun 30, 2024, position SPLP for long-term growth, particularly as global supply chains evolve.(You can read the full research report on Steel Partners here >>>)Natural Resource Partners\u2019 shares have declined -0.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Coal industry\u2019s decline of -2.4%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $1.13 billion faces significant risks from its heavy reliance on coal royalties, with metallurgical coal accounting for 75% of second-quarter 2024 coal royalty revenues.\u00a0Weakened steel demand, particularly in China and Europe, is pressuring coal prices, potentially reducing NRP's cash flow. The secular decline in U.S. thermal coal demand, driven by environmental regulations and competition from natural gas, further threatens long-term revenues.\u00a0Additionally, a surge in Chinese soda ash production is depressing global prices, impacting NRP's profitability. Inflationary pressures, labor shortages, and high financing costs also pose challenges, while stringent environmental regulations and reliance on lessees increase operational risks. Overall, NRP's exposure to volatile coal markets and regulatory risks positions it in a challenging environment.(You can read the full research report on Natural Resource Partners here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Boeing Company (BA), The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW) and MetLife, Inc.

        "Author": "  Max Juang ",
        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 5.3% in the morning session after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US producer price index (PPI - prices that businesses charge for their goods and services) in July 2024 increased 2.2% year on year, falling compared to the 2.7% y/y growth recorded in the previous month. The report also revealed a month-on-month growth of 0.1%, below analysts' estimates of 0.2%. In addition, Core PPI (prices excluding food and energy) were flat month on month. PPI is often considered a leading indicator of CPI since what businesses pay tends to be passed through to consumers. Overall, the data confirmed that inflation is cooling off. This is a favorable data point supporting an interest rate cut by the Fed. Notably, markets expect the first rate cut to be announced during the September 2024 policy meeting.\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 21 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today\u2019s move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 8 days ago, when the company dropped 14.8% as markets continued to decline, although they have recovered a bit since the open (Nasdaq down 3.6%, S&P 500 down 3%). Yields also retreated as worries about a US recession grew. The declines followed volatility on Friday, August 2, when the July Non-Farm Payrolls data revealed weaker job growth as the unemployment rate rose. Markets might also be concerned that the Fed is behind in cutting rates, with the Federal Open Market Committee leaving rates steady at 5.25%-5.50% during the July 2024 meeting. For example, respected economist and University of Pennsylvania professor Jeremy Siegel took an aggressive stance, calling on the Fed to make an emergency 75 basis-point cut in the federal funds rate after Friday\u2019s disappointing jobs report.\nNvidia is up 138% since the beginning of the year, but at $114.70 per share it is still trading 15.4% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $29,424.\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) each closed up around 0.2%.\nStocks are struggling to find a footing as investors debate whether chipmaker Nvidia's high-stakes results on Wednesday can once again live up to elevated expectations. Semiconductor stocks lost ground on Tuesday alongside a 1% drop for the AI darling, a sign of how Nvidia's report could ripple through techs as it tests the AI trade that has driven gains.\nAt the same time, investors are counting down to a crucial update to the inflation gauge favored by the Federal Reserve. Chair Jerome Powell's clear message that an interest rate cut is imminent confirmed widespread confidence in a policy pivot in September. Friday's reading on the PCE price index could dent or cement bets on a 0.5% interest rate cut next month.\nOn the corporate front, Apple (AAPL) is replacing its long-standing CFO with an insider, Kevan Parekh, with just two weeks to go for its biggest product launch of the year.

I think they will,\" Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh, told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. \"I think they will once again exceed earnings expectations. They'll exceed reveue expectations, and they're going to announce substantial growth in their data center business data centers.\"\n\"I think Nvidia is positioning themselves to be the hub of the AI ecosystem in a similar fashion that Amazon became the hub of the e-commerce ecosystem,\" he said.\nOf course, expectations are incredibly elevated, with the stock up about 160% since the start of the year. Shares have risen nearly 200% compared to the prior-year period.\nNvidia (NVDA) stock has had a wild third quarter.\nAfter falling about 30% amid a broader rotation out of tech stocks and growing concerns about delays for its new Blackwell chips, Nvidia is essentially back where it started the quarter.\nTrading around $130 a share, Nvidia is within 5% of its all-time closing high. And now that investors have already bought the dip, the looming question heading into a highly anticipated earnings release after the market close on Wednesday is what Nvidia can say to keep investors excited.\nWith Wall Street expecting earnings for the quarter grew nearly 109% and revenue soared almost 100% compared to the year prior, the bar is once again for the AI leader.\n\"It needs to be a beat and raise [guidance] quarter because I think that's sort of built into investor expectations,\" Stifel applied technology analyst Ruben Roy told Yahoo Finance. \"Certainly the discussions that we're having with success suggest that there's widely anticipated expectations for a beat for the July quarter earnings and then a sort of a beat on the guidance for the October quarter.\"\nAI juggernaut Nvidia (NVDA) will report second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday. The report has been branded as critical for the artificial intelligence trade and the tech sector at large.\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley has a preview of what to expect:\nNvidia\u2019s announcement \u2014 the most anticipated results of the quarter \u2014 comes as the stock is up more than 163% year to date and 60% in the last six months. Rival AMD\u2019s (AMD) stock price is up 9% year to date and down some 14% over the last six months.\nIntel (INTC) shares have collapsed 57% since the start of the year and are down 53% over the last six months as the company continues to struggle amid its massive turnaround effort.\nFor the quarter, Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of $0.65 on revenue of $28.7 billion. That works out to a 139% jump in EPS and a 113% increase in revenue compared to the same period a year ago when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.27 and revenue of $13.5 billion.\nNvidia is the world leader in AI chip design and software, controlling between 80% and 95% of the market, according to Reuters. And it\u2019s expected to continue to hold that lead as it begins rolling out its next-generation Blackwell line of chips.\nAnd while the Information has reported a potential delay in Blackwell shipments, analysts at firms including Goldman Sachs, KeyBanc, and Loop Capital don\u2019t see that as much of a concern for Nvidia in the near term.\n\u201cOur work suggests that while Blackwell is in fact delayed as we first wrote about on [Aug. 8], it could be more like 120 days vs 90 days ... although it may not matter much as [1)] Hopper yields from TSMC continue to improve and [2)] The amount of increased Hopper production through the fall may outweigh the amount of Blackwell forgone by the push out,\u201d Loop Capital managing director Ananda Baruah said in an investor note.\nFor the quarter, Nvidia\u2019s all-important data center business is expected to bring in $24 billion in revenue, a 142% increase from the $10.3 billion the segment saw in the same quarter last year. Wall Street is expecting Nvidia to not only beat its Q2 expectations but raise its guidance for Q3.\nRead more here.\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) stock fell nearly 2% Tuesday following a report from short seller Hindenburg Research claiming, among other things, \"accounting manipulation\" at the AI high flyer.\nHindenburg Research said its three-month investigation \"found glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.\" The firm disclosed Tuesday that it had taken a short position in Super Micro.\nYahoo Finance reached out to Super Micro and had not heard back from the company at the time of publication.\nThe maker of data center servers and management software captured the attention of investors this year as it rode the AI wave. The company buys components from AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).\nSuper Micro shares soared from $290 in early January to north of $1200 by March. The stock is off about 50% from its March peak but is still up 90% year to date. The company recently announced a 10-for-1 stock split effective Oct. 1.\nRead more here. \nReal Estate (XLRE) led Tuesday's sector action, with Utilities (XLU) and Consumer Staples (XLP) also outperforming. All three of those indexes moved more than 5% higher in mid-afternoon trading.\nThe positive moves for the XLRE come after price increases moderated somewhat in June, according to the latest reading of the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index.\nThe index increased 0.2% month over month on a seasonally adjusted basis, less than the 0.3% rise seen in May. However, home prices remain at a record, with the index climbing for a fifth straight month to hit an all-time high in June.\nEnergy, meanwhile, was the biggest laggard of the day after crude oil dropped about 2%, reversing previous gains. Oil had ripped 3% higher on Monday as production cuts in Libya, coupled with more tensions in the Middle East, added to supply concerns.\nParamount (PARA) stock fell over 5% early Tuesday after the company announced the official end of its \"go-shop\" period and billionaire Edgar Bronfman Jr. dropped out of the race to take over the media giant\nParamount's announcement all but confirms Skydance Media will be the next owner of the company, ending years of deal speculation surrounding the media giant controlled by Shari Redstone through her family's holding company, National Amusements (NAI).\n\"Having thoroughly explored actionable opportunities for Paramount over nearly eight months, our Special Committee continues to believe that the transaction we have agreed with Skydance delivers immediate value and the potential for continued participation in value creation in a rapidly evolving industry landscape,\" Charles Phillips, chair of Paramount's special committee, said in a statement.\nBronfman, heir to the Seagram spirits fortune and current executive chairman at FuboTV (FUBO), submitted a last-minute bid earlier this month. At the time, the proposed $6 billion takeover of National Amusements threatened to derail the roughly $8 billion agreement the company reached with Skydance just one month prior.\nAccording to multiple reports, Bronfman had difficulty securing the financing for the deal, which included investors like Fortress and BC Partners Credit. This difficulty led to Bronfman's early withdrawal from the bid process.\n\"We continue to believe that Paramount Global is an extraordinary company, with an unrivaled collection of marquee brands, assets and people,\" Bronfman said in a statement.\nThe Skydance transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approval.\nRead more here. \nConsumer confidence rose more than expected in August despite a continued weakening in consumers' assessment of the labor market.\nThe latest index reading from the Conference Board was 103.3, above the 101.9 seen in July and higher than the 100.7 economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected.\n\"Overall consumer confidence rose in August but remained within the narrow range that has prevailed over the past two years,\" said Dana M. Peterson, Conference Board chief economist. \"Consumers continued to express mixed feelings in August. Compared to July, they were more positive about business conditions, both current and future, but also more concerned about the labor market.\"\nPeterson added: \"Consumers' assessments of the current labor situation, while still positive, continued to weaken, and assessments of the labor market going forward were more pessimistic. This likely reflects the recent increase in unemployment. Consumers were also a bit less positive about future income.\"\nThe report comes as recent economic data has shown softening in the labor market. In July, the unemployment rate hit 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years. Meanwhile, the US labor market added 114,000 jobs, the second-lowest monthly total since 2020.\nIn August's consumer confidence report, 32.8% of people said jobs were \"plentiful,\" down from 33.4% in July. Meanwhile, 16.4% said jobs were \"hard to get,\" up slightly from 16.3%.\nUS stocks moved lower on Tuesday after the Dow hit an all-time high the day prior.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell roughly 0.2%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) also edged about 0.2% lower while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped roughly 0.3% on the heels of closing losses for both gauges.\n"

A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2025.\nNon-GAAP MeasuresTo supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nNVIDIA CORPORATION\n\u00a0CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

        "Text": "Shares of AI juggernaut Nvidia (NVDA) sank more than 1% in early trading on Thursday, despite posting better than anticipated second quarter earnings Wednesday. The company also said it expects Q3 revenue ahead of guidance.\nNvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.68 on revenue of $30 billion in its fiscal second quarter. Analysts were expecting EPS of $0.64 and revenue of $28.8 billion. That marks a 122% increase on the top line from a year ago; earnings rose 168% from the same quarter last year.\nThe company also provided third quarter revenue guidance of $32.5 billion plus or minus 2%. Analysts were looking for $31.9 billion.\nThe stock fell as much as 6% in immediate reaction to the numbers.\nThe bulk of that revenue came from Nvidia\u2019s all-important data center business, which brought in $26.3 billion in the quarter versus Wall Street's expectations of $25 billion in revenue. That's a 154% increase from the same period last year when the segment brought in $10.3 billion.\nIn a statement, CEO Jensen Huang said anticipation for the company's next-generation Blackwell chip is \"incredible.\"\nCFO Colette Kress said in a statement, \"Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue.\"\nKress's statement added that the company \"executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield.\"\nThe company expects shipments of its current Hopper chips to \"increase\" in the second half of the year.\nNvidia also announced Wednesday a $50 billion increase in its share buyback authorization. The company had $7.5 billion remaining on its existing authorization at the end of the quarter.\nNvidia's gaming division, which used to stand as the company's breadwinner, saw revenue of $2.8 billion, up 16% year over year.\nNvidia is the world leader in AI chip design and software, controlling between 80% and 95% of the market, according to Reuters.\nThe company has also been key to the current AI trade on Wall Street, with almost half of its revenue tied directly to tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta.\nNvidia\u2019s rivals aren\u2019t resting on their laurels. Earlier this month, AMD announced it is acquiring ZT Systems in a deal valued at $4.9 billion. The move gives AMD more firepower to build out AI system servers, something that\u2019s been a major catalyst for Nvidia\u2019s own sales.\nAnd while it could provide AMD with a boost in sales, it doesn\u2019t mean Nvidia will face any major threats to its reign as the AI king anytime soon.\n\"There are emerging competitors like AMD that are starting to take a little bit of market share,\" Stifel managing director Ruben Roy told Yahoo Finance Monday. \"But when you look at the overall infrastructure spend cycle \u2026 which we think is going to continue to increase, Nvidia appears to us as the best positioned to benefit from [spending].\"\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": "  Josh Schafer    \u00b7 Reporter",
        "Text": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) climbed over 1% in premarket trading on Tuesday, following a rise of up to 5% on Monday. This surge led to a broader rally in tech stocks as Wall Street continued to debate whether the recent slump in the semiconductor sector has been overdone.\nOn Monday,\u00a0Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya noted Nvidia is one of the firm's top \"rebound\" picks amid what he expects to be a comeback for semiconductors to end 2024.\n\"Our base case remains for a [semiconductor] rebound likely in Q4 as seasonal headwinds dissipate,\" Arya wrote in a note to clients.\nArya noted that Broadcom (AVGO) and KLA Corporation (KLAC) could also benefit from a rebound as they are the \"most profitable vendors in their respective end-markets,\" in addition to Nvidia.\nThe PHLX Semiconductor index (^SOX) is down nearly 18% in the last month, while Nvidia stock is off more than 15% over the same time period. The sector has been swept up in a rotation by market participants out of large-cap technology.\nArya reasoned that volatility is likely to continue through Nvidia's next earnings release on Aug. 28 and into September, which is historically the worst month of the year for semiconductor stocks. Arya noted that the current upward trend in semiconductor stocks has only been underway for four quarters, while prior runs have typically lasted for closer to 10 quarters.\nNvidia stock, in particular, has been under pressure amid growing concerns about the distribution of its Blackwell chip. Last week, The Information reported Nvidia's upcoming next-generation AI chips would be delayed by three months, potentially impacting big customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META).\nNvidia then issued a statement stating its next-generation Blackwell chip production \"is on track to ramp\" in the second half of the year. And Wall Street analysts believe the issue will be resolved.\n\"If it's really a supply or timing issue, I think most investors are willing to kind of look through that,\" KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst John Vinh told Yahoo Finance. \"If it was a demand issue, I think we'd have other issues here with Nvidia. But from our perspective, we think they'll beat and raise [earnings guidance]. We don't think near-term demand is going to be an issue at all.\"\nUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri maintained his Buy rating on the stock and a $150 price target in a note to clients on Monday while also remarking that he believes Blackwell customer volume shipments are likely delayed four to six weeks \"at most.\"\n\"Lead customers should have first Blackwell instances stood up in April 2025 timeframe,\" Arcuri wrote. \"AI labs are still upsizing and lengthening their instance commitments and enterprises are rapidly growing as a proportion of the demand mix \u2014 both bullish indicators.\"\nAdditionally, Arcuri argued the market may be underestimating Nvidia's future earnings growth. For now, Arcuri believes the market is currently pricing in peak earnings growth for Nvidia in 2025. But Arcuri argued that 2026 \"seems more likely to be up again given our customer discussions.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Nvidia's stock (NVDA) is back, but it\u2019s about to be put to the test again. The chipmaker's stock is up 159% year to date and has risen more than 60% over the last six months. Compare this to chip rival, Intel (INTC), which has seen its stock fall over 60% year to date.\nThe next big event for the market is the chip darling\u2019s earnings report, set for after the bell on Wednesday, as our Executive Editor Brian Sozzi excitedly pointed out.\nAnd it\u2019s not just Nvidia's stock that\u2019s on the line: Nvidia\u2019s closely watched results will set the pace for other artificial intelligence players.\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s report and guidance will be absolutely key to the AI infrastructure trade,\u201d tech investor Paul Meeks told Yahoo Finance.\nThe past several weeks have been a roller-coaster ride for tech investors. Shares of AI giants Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) are down over the past three months, with Alphabet falling more than 6% and both Amazon and Microsoft down more than 3%.\nAnd second-tier AI players are struggling to regain traction as well. AMD (AMD) has fallen more than 16% since mid-July while Marvell Technology (MRVL) is off nearly 6% in the same period.\nBut strong results from Nvidia could reignite some of that lost momentum, according to Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives.\n\u201cNvidia is the heart and lungs of this bullish tech trade as the AI Revolution takes hold,\u201d Ives told me.\nIves, who expects a \u201cshock and awe\u201d quarter from Nvidia, said continued strong demand for the company\u2019s chips will have ripple effects across the industry. In a recent note to clients, Ives estimated that for every dollar spent on a Nvidia GPU chip, there is an $8 to $10 multiplier across the tech sector.\nBernstein\u2019s Mark Shmulik, who covers many of Nvidia's biggest customers including Meta (META), Amazon, and Google, told me the chip giant\u2019s results will be a critical driver of Big Tech\u2019s next move.\n\u201cNvidia is a bellwether of the 'Magnificent Seven' and AI trade,\u201d Shmulik explained. \u201cIf there is any softness, maybe rotation out of the Mag 7 picks up a little bit of steam, but listening to other tech earnings, core fundamentals keep delivering.\u201d\nSo far this year, Nvidia\u2019s stock has soared. Shares are up 180% over the past year and up nearly 2,900% over the past five years \u2014 setting the bar very high for earnings this quarter.\nEstimates are for Nvidia's revenue to grow 112% in its latest quarter, marking a dramatic slowdown from over 250% growth one year ago. For Wall Street, the consensus remains bullish. KeyBanc, Citi, and Goldman Sachs were among those on the street who reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock this week ahead of results.\nWhile only time will tell whether Nvidia lives up to the hype this earnings season, it\u2019s safe to say the stakes are high.\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "One Nvidia (NVDA) bear warned the time has come for investors to sell.\nNvidia failed to meet sky-high expectations when it reported its fiscal second quarter earnings on Wednesday. Nvidia reported profits and revenue that topped forecasts but not by as much as investors hoped, delivering its smallest earnings beat in the last six quarters.\nNvidia stock fell 6% on Wednesday evening in reaction to the results and continued to slide 4% lower on Thursday afternoon. Year to date, the stock remains up nearly 140%.\nWhen asked when it might be time to sell, David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of Bahnsen Group, said, \"About a month ago. Two months ago. Today. Tomorrow.\"\n\"People are paying for perfection,\" Bahnsen added (video above). \"You're buying Nvidia banking on there being another investor who's a bigger sucker than you are.\"\nThe warning from Bahnsen comes as the stock has rallied 1,000% from its October 2022 lows. His call is based on one data point: Nvidia\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio, which sits just above 56 after earnings but neared 80 in July.\nHe offered a reminder that a company and its stock are not the same thing.\n\"This is not me bashing on Nvidia,\" Bahnsen said. \"This is a success story. I'm commenting on the valuation \u2014 that when you start paying those prices, the risk-reward skew becomes very unattractive.\"\nStill, it\u2019s a risk that the 89% of analysts with a Buy rating on the stock are willing to take. The stock has zero Sell ratings, which is understandable considering Nvidia posted $30 billion in revenue in the second quarter, a 122% increase over the same period last year.\nNvidia's future depends in part on other Big Tech companies. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) are responsible for 40% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue, according to Bloomberg estimates.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai indicated on the company\u2019s earnings call this quarter that the company's spending on artificial intelligence would not slow down. \u201cThe one way I think about it is when you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us,\u201d Pichai said.\nAlphabet's investment in AI, which represents a significant portion of Nvidia\u2019s revenue, could be a bullish signal to come. But those business fundamentals aren\u2019t the only focus.\n\"The estimates for next year and the year after that are starting to get way, way out of control,\" D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance.\nThe next big question for investors is whether the Street\u2019s reaction to Nvidia results this quarter will be enough to dampen earnings expectations heading into Q3.\nFor Bahnsen, it may already be too late.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia has once again turned out quarterly results that easily exceeded Wall Street's forecast s. The company has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications.\nRevenue more than doubled in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier, Nvidia said Wednesday. The company expects further revenue growth in the current quarter that ends in October. Investors will be watching to see if demand for the company's products can maintain its red-hot pace.\nThe company\u2019s journey to be one of the most prominent players in AI has produced some eye-popping numbers. Here's a look.\n$3.156 Trillion\nNvidia\u2019s total market value as of the close Wednesday. It's ahead of Microsoft ($3.076 trillion) but behind Apple ($3.457 trillion) in the battle for most valuable company. One year ago, the company's market was around $1.15 trillion.\n154%\nGain in Nvidia's stock price so far this year as of the close of trading Wednesday. The shares fell about 4% in after-hours trading following the release of the company's earnings.\n30%\nThat's how much of the S&P 500\u2019s gain for the year through June came only from Nvidia.\n$26.3 billion\nNvidia's revenue from its data center business for the quarter ended July 31, up 154% from a year ago. Overall revenue rose 122% from a year ago to $30 billion. By comparison, revenue growth for all the companies in the S&P 500 is expected to be about 5% for the latest quarter.\n$32.5 billion\nNvidia's estimate for overall revenue in the third quarter, \u201cplus or minus 2%.\u201d That translates to a range of $31.85 billion to $33.15 billion, compared to Wall Street's estimate of $31.7 billion. Revenue in the year-ago third quarter totaled $18.1 billion.\n$121.1 billion\nAnalysts\u2019 estimate for Nvidia\u2019s revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025.

        "Text": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is back near all-time highs.\nA recent rally in tech, including a nearly 30% pop in Nvidia (NVDA), has helped bring the index up more than 7% since its Aug. 5 bottom.\nIn that time, the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 have added more than $1.4 trillion in market cap, nearly half of the S&P 500's $3.2 trillion market cap gain since Aug. 5.\nAfter a massive drawdown in July, the recent surge helped bring the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) out of correction in 11 days, marking its shortest correction since October 2011.\nNed Davis Research chief US strategist Ed Clissold recently told Yahoo Finance that given how tech led the losses in the drawdown, it \"makes sense that they're going to rebound.\"\nAnd now, some of the largest names in the sector are sitting back near 52-week highs ahead of a crucial earnings report from Nvidia on Aug. 28.\nDuring second quarter earnings season, some of Nvidia's AI-powered rivals offered a mixed bag of results that struggled to live up to Wall Street's expectations. \n\"This would be the ninth day in a row the S&P is up,\" Niles Investment Management founder Dan Niles told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \"It's the longest streak since 2004. I wouldn't necessarily be pushing that into an Nvidia print.\n\"But I think if you're not worried about what happens the day after and you're thinking about this over a multiyear period of time, it should be in pretty good shape.\"\nAnd while the AI trade has once again been leading the market's latest leg higher, there have been promising developments under the surface at play too.\nThe S&P 500 equal-weighted index (^SPXEW), which is less influenced than the cap-weighted S&P by moves in Big Tech, just hit a new record high. Sectors including Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Health Care (XLV) are now sitting at 52-week highs, while Financials (XLF) are currently at a record level.\n\"This has been a really healthy rally in our view,\" Abby Yoder, JPMorgan US equity strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"It has been this broadening out. Breadth is the best that it's been since the summer of last year. In terms of the participation across different sectors, different names.\"\nStill, the S&P 500 is up almost 18% this year, outpacing the equal-weighted index's nearly 9% this year.\n\"The reality is that in bull markets, all sectors typically go up,\" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\nIn July, Gordon's team at Schwab pointed out in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook that the amount of S&P 500 companies outperforming the index on a rolling two-month basis had fallen to a historic low.\nSince then, that narrative has fully flipped. As of Monday's close, roughly 58% of members in the S&P 500 were outperforming the index, the largest swath of outperformance since November 2022, when the current bull market began.\n\"The trend is much more important,\" Gordon said. \"Across those metrics, things look relatively healthy.\"\nRecent economic data has showed a slowing, but still growing, US economy, and market action over the last few weeks is in line with the soft-landing-fueled broadening out trade strategists have been discussing since the start of 2024. \nAnd though tech will likely still contribute to the rally, JPMorgan's Yoder said the rotation in other areas could have more room as the \"growth backdrop does look healthy and we're about to embark on a Fed [interest rate] cutting cycle as well.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Wednesday was another rough day for the stock market, this time with a weak bond auction contributing to downbeat sentiment.\nNvidia NVDA, the darling of the market for the last two years, slumped 5% and could now be said to be in a bear market, as it\u2019s down more than 20% (23%, to be precise) from its recent high.\n\u2018There is a 50% chance I could get evicted\u2019: My mother offered to buy me a $1.5 million house, but there\u2019s a catch.

That could set up markets for another trap.\nFor those tempted to wade in, Aswath Damodaran, the NYU Stern School of Business finance professor oft quoted as the \u201cdean of valuation,\u201d says Nvidia\u2019s stock price only makes sense if investors assume the company will invent and succeed in a whole new segment.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing in favor of Nvidia. I call it my opportunistic growth company,\u201d he said in an interview with Niels Kaastrup-Larsen of the Top Traders Unplugged podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s a company that\u2019s managed to find new markets and jump into them ahead of everybody else. It did it with gaming. It did it with crypto. It did it with AI,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe first time, you can call them lucky. The second time, you can call them really lucky. The third time around, there\u2019s something the company is doing that\u2019s allowing them to get ahead of their competition and big market,\u201d he added.\nDamodaran said while it\u2019s a bet investors can make, \u201cit\u2019s not AI that justifies the [peak valuation] of $3 trillion. It\u2019s the expectation that Nvidia will find another business out there that is big and be the first mover there.\u201d\nHe made several comparisons of Nvidia to network equipment maker Cisco during the dot-com bubble of 2000. \u201cEven if you believe the Goldman Sachs numbers for AI being a $3 trillion business or a $4 trillion business, the architecture for AI, which is what Nvidia provides, can\u2019t be more than a half a trillion of that. And that\u2019s actually larger than any of the predictions I\u2019ve seen for how high the AI chip business has going,\u201d he said.\nRelated: Nvidia\u2019s stock offers \u2018tremendous opportunity\u2019 after selloff, this analyst says\nPerhaps more striking than his analysis of Nvidia is his view toward value investing in general. \u201cI think I will shed no tears for the burial of value investing, as it existed, because it\u2019s time we put it to rest,\u201d he says.\nHe said he\u2019s never attended a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in Omaha. He called the meetings \u201crighteous\u201d and \u201critualistic,\u201d from their professed reading of Benjamin Graham to \u201cworshipping at the alter of [Warren] Buffett and [Charlie] Munger.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019We\u2019re the grownups.\u2019 That\u2019s basically what I heard from value investors. \u2018We\u2019re the grownups. These traders, they\u2019re shallow. These tech investors, they\u2019re shallow,\u2019\u201d said Damodaran. \u201cAnd the problem with being righteous is you think you deserve to be rewarded for doing the right things. And that\u2019s a terrible place to start investing.\u201d\nDamodaran said he owns each of the Magnificent Seven stocks. \u201cI didn\u2019t buy them in 2023, thank God, but they were all cheap at a point in time, and I chose to buy them then,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the right price, you should be willing to buy any stock.\u201d\nU.S. stock-index futures ES00 NQ00 turned higher after jobless-claims data.

        "Text": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are causing a paradigm shift in technology, and the consequences will likely be far-reaching. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the de facto standard bearer for the AI revolution, as its state-of-the-art graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard for training AI models and conducting AI inference.\nThe accelerating adoption of generative AI has been the catalyst that has sparked parabolic growth for the chipmaker, generating triple-digit sales and profit growth in each of the past four quarters.\nNvidia is scheduled to report the results of its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 30) after market close on Wednesday, Aug. 28, and shareholders will be watching with keen interest. I predict the company will deliver record results, sending Nvidia stock to record heights. Here's why.\nNvidia made a name for itself as a pioneer in the video game industry, developing chips that used parallel processing, or the ability to run a multitude of complex computations simultaneously. This generated lifelike images in video games, revolutionizing the industry. Nvidia adapted this same technology to handle the raw, number-crunching needs of AI and quickly cornered the market in this emerging technology.\nThe vast majority of AI processing takes place in data centers, and Nvidia has already proven its worth at zipping information through the ether. The company controlled an estimated 98% of the data center GPU market last year, according to data compiled by semiconductor analysts at TechInsights.\nThe growing demand for AI has data center and cloud operators spending heavily to upgrade their capabilities to handle the rigors of AI processing. Making AI available to the masses is expected to unleash a wave of productivity that's expected to add trillions of dollars to the global economy.\nWhile Nvidia had a head start in this emerging industry, the company isn't resting on its laurels. Earlier this year, the company unveiled its Blackwell architecture, which contained a host of new technology that promises to take AI to the next level.\nPerhaps more impressive is the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which connects two B200 GPUs with an Nvidia Grace CPU to form \"the world's most powerful chip\" for AI.\nWhile there have been reports of a potential launch delay, more recent reports suggest Nvidia is still on track to begin shipping its next-generation AI chip early next year.\nThis all helps to illustrate that Nvidia has no plans of ceding its strategic advantage or market-leading position anytime soon.\nNvidia has proven its mettle over the past year, but investors are looking to the future. Concerns about inflation and the growth of the economy have taken center stage in recent weeks, with economists debating whether the Federal Reserve Bank has waited too long to lower interest rates or whether it can still engineer a soft landing -- bringing inflation under control, without tipping the economy into a recession. Those fears have begun to subside, so investors are turning their sights to Nvidia, which is widely viewed as a bellwether for the state of AI adoption.\nA look back at Nvidia's outlook in recent quarters can provide much-needed insight into what investors should expect next week. In each of the past four quarters, Nvidia has delivered triple-digit growth, which has outpaced its own guidance, and in each instance by a fair margin. Nvidia's revenue growth has sailed past its outlook by a margin of between 8% and 19%, which suggests the company's current forecast is equally conservative.\nFor its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 30), Nvidia is guiding for revenue of $28 billion, representing an increase of 107% year over year. Wall Street is even more enthusiastic, with analysts' consensus estimates rising to $28.6 billion. Even that may end up being conservative, as Nvidia has surpassed investor expectations for sales and profits in each of the past four quarters -- again by a fair margin.\nIf Nvidia beats its own revenue guidance by at least 8% or more -- which it has done in each of the preceding four quarters -- that would put its revenue at $30 billion or more. If that's the case, it will likely come with a commensurate increase in its guidance, resulting in a classic \"beat and raise.\" Since this is almost always a bullish signal, the stock price will likely jump in response.\nTo be clear, investors will be watching Nvidia's forward-looking guidance for evidence the secular tailwind of AI is still blowing strong. Based on the available evidence and using history as a guide, I predict that Nvidia will deliver record-breaking results and surpass expectations, sending its stock to new heights.\nThanks to Nvidia's superb results, there's been a commensurate increase in its valuation. Analysts and investors alike have been scrambling to decide how best to value Nvidia stock, but we're in unchartered territory here. Nvidia generated revenue of $61 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), an increase of 126%. Growth of that magnitude is certainly deserving of a premium, but there's no consensus regarding the size of said premium.\nNvidia is currently selling for 75 times earnings, but that number is about to see a dramatic reset after the company delivers its financial report, as new, higher profits are factored into the ratio. The chart clearly shows the stark decline in the wake of each of its three previous financial reports in November, February, and May, respectively.\nWhile some investors might balk at paying in the neighborhood of 50 times earnings (represented by the dips in the stock chart), I would argue that's a fair price to pay for a company delivering triple-digit growth and leading the fourth industrial revolution.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Tirthankar Chakraborty ",
        "Text": "Wall Street darling NVIDIA Corporation NVDA recently reported its fiscal second-quarter results, following which its shares dipped. Does this mean that NVIDIA has lost its sheen to arch-rivals Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Intel Corporation INTC in the semiconductor space? Or, does it still have the potential to increase shareholders\u2019 wealth soon? Let\u2019s examine \u2013 \nNVIDIA recently posted blowout second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues and net income that easily surpassed analysts\u2019 estimates. For the quarter ending on July 28, 2024, earnings per share for the chipmaker came in at $0.68, up 11% from the prior quarter and up 152% year over year.\nTotal reported revenues were $30 billion, up 15% from the previous quarter and 122% from a year ago. Revenues of each segment, such as data center, gaming, professional visualization, and robotics were up from the previous quarter and year.\nStrong demand for existing Hopper chips and shipping of next-generation Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) chips to be launched later this year boosted NVIDIA\u2019s quarterly results.\nHowever, despite such promising quarterly results, NVIDIA\u2019s shares dipped 6.4% in Thursday\u2019s trading and were 2.1% lower on Wednesday. This is because the performance expectations were much higher as the NVIDIA stock is currently the S&P 500\u2019s best performer this year.\nThe share price drop at the moment is just a blip for NVIDIA. This is because if we look at the broader picture, with the Federal Reserve all set to trim interest rates in the September policy meeting, NVIDIA\u2019s capital expenditure outlays on AI-related infrastructure are expected to increase.\nAI is a growing field, with the industry expected to expand from $214.6 billion in the current year to $1,339.1 billion by 2030, per MarketsandMarkets.\nWhile the Blackwell AI chip launch will give NVIDIA a competitive edge over its peers, its gaming graphic processing units (GPU) product line, GeForce, is expected to help NVIDIA penetrate the growing gaming market. NVIDIA\u2019s initiative to enter the industrial metaverse space with the help of Siemens is also a tailwind for the company.\nLike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices also makes semiconductors and is trying to enter the gaming space. However, NVIDIA is way ahead of Advanced Micro Devices, whose latest quarterly revenues were minuscule compared to that of NVIDIA. In the recently reported quarter, Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 total revenues increased just 9% from a year ago.\nAdvanced Micro Devices is investing heavily in AI, but unlike NVIDIA, they are late to the party. Any AI investment takes a long period to generate returns on the invested capital. Moreover, Advanced Micro Devices hasn\u2019t poured money into the necessary AI infrastructure, which can be an issue for the company in the long run.\nAnyhow, Advanced Micro Devices is losing the competition with NVIDIA. Per data from Jon Peddie Research, Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 market shares in GPUs have fallen from 35% to 12% over the past decade, while NVIDIA\u2019s shares have risen from 65% to 88%.\nWhile NVIDIA is in a league of its own, Intel is struggling to compete with Advanced Micro Devices, which has seen some progress in the production of high-performance processing machinery.\nIntel is in dire straits after failing to progress in the foundry business. Intel failed to make the most of the ever-expanding AI applications industry, where most of its peers are doing reasonably well.\nIntel\u2019s server and networking segment is also being disrupted by Arm Holdings plc ARM. Many of ARM\u2019s designs in the micro server segment have been accepted by Intel\u2019s competitors. Intel\u2019s shares never fully recovered from the dot-com bubble burst and currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.\nNVIDIA has generated profits more proficiently than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. This is because the NVIDIA stock has a return on equity (ROE) of 124.6%, while Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have an ROE of 6% and 1.8%, respectively. As a thumb rule, any reading above 20% is considered very good.\nNVIDIA\u2019s net profit margin is 55%, way more than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel\u2019s 5.8% and 1.8%, respectively. Any reading above the threshold of 20% signifies the company has been able to keep operation costs under control and generate profit from sales. As a result, the $2.71 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s earnings per share is up 74.8% year over year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a technical perspective, the NVIDIA stock has been constantly trading above its 200-day moving average (DMA) so far this year, indicating a long-term uptrend.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOn the other hand, the prices of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have fallen below the 200 DMA this year, a tell-tale sign of a persistent downtrend.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWith NVIDIA\u2019s shares exhibiting a bullish trend and the stock faring much better than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel in the AI space and beyond, notable brokers have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 13.5% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $125.61. The analysts\u2019 highest price target is at $200.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHence, despite the recent hiccups, investors should hang on to the NVIDIA stock more than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, as AI is here to stay (read more: 2 AI Stocks That Can Be the Next NVIDIA).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Nvidia NVDA, undoubtedly the most highly-awaited company for the Q2 earnings season, has finally delivered its results. So far, shares have faced an adverse reaction, down in after-hours trading.\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at what the company delivered.\nThe AI favorite generated record quarterly sales of $30 billion, reflecting a 15% sequential jump from Q1 and an even more impressive 122% year-over-year climb. The company\u2019s sales growth has been remarkable, with this period\u2019s results penciling in the fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit percentage year-over-year top-line growth.\nOf course, Data Center results were the true focal point of the release, which again delivered in a big way. Data Center sales reached a quarterly record of $26.3 billion, up 16% sequentially from Q1 and 154% on a year-over-year stack.\nJensen Huang was unsurprisingly bullish on the Data Center, stating, \u2018Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.\u2019\nHe continued, \u2018NVIDIA achieved record revenues as global data centers are in full throttle to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI.\u2019\nThough its gross margin did fall sequentially, the 75.7% print reflected continued margin expansion relative to the year-ago period.\nNvidia\u2019s gaming results are also a key area that investors should keep a close eye on in future periods, particularly as AI PCs continue to gain steam. Gaming revenue reached $2.9 billion, reflecting a nice 16% year-over-year climb from the year-ago period.\nConcerning the outlook for Q3, Nvidia expects sales of $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75.0%, respectively.\nNvidia NVDA has finally delivered its Q2 results, with the reaction post-earnings negative so far despite posting another record-breaking release that re-confirmed robust demand.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Jefferies, Citi and Wall Street Analysts.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other data center stocks.\nThe boom in the interest surrounding artificial intelligence has not only affected semiconductor stocks, even though they're the biggest beneficiaries. While the chips that these companies make are indispensable for running AI workloads, they have to be housed somewhere, and this is where data centers come into play.\nIn fact, for the data center space, AI has only accelerated the growing demand this industry is seeing. Prior to AI GPUs and accelerators, enterprise computing chips made by the same companies that are now making AI chips were seeing hefty demand. This demand led to gaming GPU companies effectively being transformed into enterprise computing firms, with sectors such as the SaaS and cloud computing industries relying on these products. For some SaaS stocks, you should check out 10 Best SaaS Stocks To Buy Now.\nThis pre AI demand for data centers is visible in statistics too. Data from Jefferies shows that the demand growth for data centers has jumped by between 10% to 20% for the last 15 years, or before AI GPUs hit the market. As expected, AI has accelerated this demand, with the demand for data center space outpacing 30% in most markets for the past two years. This growth in real estate requirements also means that while the computing industry might be able to scale up by providing products like networking gear and cables, tertiary industries like energy generation will take some time to catch up.\nIf you're a believer in AI, then the optimistic line of thought would suggest that these tertiary firms will only grow in the future as they scale up their operations to meet the growth in AI data centers. After all, data from Goldman shows that a query made to ChatGPT consumes ten times as much energy as a Google search query - understandable since ChatGPT is parsing through data and drawing insights to generate a response. By 2030, AI is expected to grow data center power demand by as much as 160%, as data centers potentially account for 4% of global energy consumption and Europe in particular needs more than $1 trillion to power its AI grid.\nNaturally, since the US is responsible for ushering in AI, AI energy consumption in America is higher than that in other countries. According to the Boston Consulting Group, by 2030, AI power consumption will account for 16% of all of America's energy use. It is expected to grow by 15% to 20% annually and touch as much as 130 GW, or the amount of electricity that's used by 100 million homes. AI chip companies are also aware of these trends, with the latest AI chips promising to improve energy efficiency by 25x. Improving AI performance at the semiconductor level is important especially since some areas where data centers are growing are being forced to turn to coal power to reduce the power gap.\nNowhere is this clearer than in Northern Virginia, where data centers process 70% of the world's internet traffic. With more than 300 data centers that churn out more than $700 million in taxes annually, the region's computing centers are expected to require a whopping 11,000 megawatts of electricity annually by 2035 according to estimates by the local regulator. This demand has also spurred a $5.2 billion effort to lay down new transmission lines and keep coal power plants open for longer than initially planned.\nNot only does AI need real estate and power, but it also needs water. Since energy can neither be created nor destroyed, all the megawatts of power that AI chips need have to go somewhere. For the chips, it is dissipated in the form of heat, and cooling this requires copious amounts of water. Estimates show that not only does training GPT-3 evaporate a whopping 700,000 liters of drinkable water, but global AI demand by 2027 could end up using anywhere between 4.2 billion to 6.6 billion cubic meters of water.\nComing back to real estate, it might be the easiest way for the AI savvy investor to cash in on the world's thirst for computing. Citi believes that the \"development and construction of hyper-scale data center capacity will grow meaningfully over the next 7 years,\" as global industrial giants expand into the data center space. Not only are industrial firms actually converting their warehouses into data centers, but Citi adds that the associated power demand for these computing facilities will grow between the mid teens annually until 2030.\nSo, as these Wall Street firms lay out a maze of industries that will profit from AI, we decided to look at the top data center stocks to buy according to analysts.\nOur Methodology \nTo make our list of the top data center stocks to buy, we ranked the US listed holdings of Global X's data center ETF and the stocks chosen by Jefferies and Citi by the average analyst share price target percentage upside and picked out the stocks with the highest upside.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target Upside: 25%\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $125.43\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 186\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the hottest stock in the AI sector right now. However, the fact that its shares are up by 135% over the past twelve months means that further upside is limited. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the data center industry due to its plethora of GPUs and bundles. Not only does it sell standalone GPUs, but it also sells them in clusters that are tailor made for AI use. The GPUs' tight integration with their CUDA software means that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) customers enjoy a significant advantage when it comes to squeezing the most performance from the products. However, the very fact that it sits at the top of the AI supply chain leaves NVIDIA vulnerable to competitors and customers designing their own chips and regulators deciding that it has abused its competitive power. However, analysts are certain of robust demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s products until at least 2025 end.\nAristotle Atlantic Partners mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\"Nvidia contributed to portfolio performance in the second quarter as investors continued to view positively the new product roadmap for the rest of the year. The company sees accelerating demand for its GPU semiconductors from hyperscalers and enterprises. Nvidia\u2019s GPU semiconductors continue to be the industry-leading building blocks of the accelerated computing data center architecture to drive AI compute and applications.\"\nOverall NVDA ranks 13th on our list of the best data center stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

He thinks it\u2019s not possible to call a bottom on this decline yet \u201cuntil we know these sellers are done unwinding their trades.\u201d\nCramer said that another key reason why investors were selling on Monday was the notion that the Fed is late on cutting rates. But Cramer said a 25 bps rate cut wouldn\u2019t have mattered a lot and if Fed Chair Jerome Powell sees there is a need for an urgent rate cut, he\u2019d do it.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got horse sense,\u201d Cramer said.\nJim Cramer said there are no \u201csafe havens\u201d in tech and while he reiterated his bullish view on some notable tech stocks, he advised investors to be ready for \u201cpain\u201d in the near term if they want to invest in technology.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t take the pain, then get the heck out of it.\u201d\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 important stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\nJim Cramer in a latest program reiterated that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is doing \u201camazing things\u201d with generative AI and accelerated computing and they don\u2019t have anything to do with the Fed. Despite this, Cramer said that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has \u201cbecome a wasteland.\u201d\nCramer said he does not see NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) decline stopping here mainly because the company does not benefit from the upcoming rate cuts.\nCramer thinks the market\u2019s earnings estimate for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is low, and \u201cmaybe\u201d the company can earn $4.59 next year, which means it\u2019s trading at 23x earnings.\n\u201cI am not selling the greatest growth stock of our generation\u201d at 23 times earnings, Cramer said.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\u201cVisibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,\u201d the firm said.\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company\u2019s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won\u2019t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has \u201ctriggered a mechanical sell signal\u201d based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) rapid run and soaring valuation have started to make some circles on Wall Street uneasy. New Street Research last month downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy and set the stock\u2019s price target at $135.\n\u201cWe downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.\u201d New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu said.\nHowever, New Street upgraded the stock recently after the latest selloff and set a price target of $120, saying:\n\u201cWe find the correction healthy overall, recognize some limited and tactical headwinds specific to Nvidia, but overall see the stock moves as an opportunity to gain more exposure.\"\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).\u201d\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks Amid Global Selloff. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Rita Nazareth ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Stocks hovered near all-time highs, with traders awaiting Nvidia Corp.\u2019s results for clues on whether the artificial-intelligence euphoria that\u2019s powered the bull market has more room to run.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA Guide to Urban Swimming in Europe, Beyond the Seine\nDense Cities With Low Emissions Suffer Most From Air Pollution, Study Finds\nIntergenerational Housing Could Help Older Adults Combat Loneliness\nTurkey Plans Istanbul Taxi Surge to Tackle Complaints\nJust a day ahead of the giant chipmaker\u2019s earnings, investors are getting ready to see whether the AI darling will at least match Wall Street\u2019s lofty estimates. Given its massive influence on broader indexes, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s trading desk has once called Nvidia \u201cthe most important stock on planet Earth.\u201d A member of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d group of megacaps, the company has been responsible for over a third of the Nasdaq 100\u2019s gain this year.\nInvestors are gearing up for big swings in Nvidia\u2019s shares after the $3.2 trillion company led by Jensen Huang reports earnings on Wednesday. Trading in the options market implies a nearly 10% move in either direction on the day following the results. The stock has rallied about 160% this year and 1,000% from its October 2022 bear-market low.\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s earnings report may actually have more impact on the overall market than Jerome Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole speech last week,\u201d said Anthony Saglimbene at Ameriprise Financial. \u201cMove over, Powell. It\u2019s Jensen Huang\u2019s turn to move markets.\u201d\nTo Chris Senyek at Wolfe Research, Nvidia\u2019s results will set the tone for markets before the key US payrolls report on Sept. 6.\n\u201cWe remain bullish, but risks are now skewed to the downside over the very near-term. From a seasonal perspective, we enter a weaker period that is even more amplified in election years,\u201d Senyek said.\nThe S&P 500 edged up to around 5,625. The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.3%. A closely watched gauge of chipmakers added 1.1%. Nvidia climbed 1.5%. Software firm Salesforce Inc., which also reports results on Wednesday, fell 0.4%. Super Micro Computer Inc. slid 2.6% after Hindenburg Research said it\u2019s short the maker of server equipment. The Russell 2000 of small caps dropped 0.7%.\nTreasury 10-year yields rose one basis point to 3.83%. A $69 billion US sale of two-year notes was well-received. Oil fell as technical measures signaled a three-day rally driven by the threat of a halt to Libyan supplies was overdone.\nWith questions swirling around Federal Reserve policy, the state of the economy and the US presidential race, at least one thing seems clear on Wall Street: spending on AI is still key.\nConcerns about the returns of those investments recently contributed to a tech selloff, although that dip was readily bought. AI hardware and chip companies have led the bounce in the Nasdaq 100 from its August low, with Nvidia up about 30%.\nNvidia accounts for more than 6% of the S&P 500\u2019s market cap in terms of its index weight, so \u201cit\u2019s increasingly a bigger component of where the trend and momentum of the market goes,\u201d Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management told Bloomberg Surveillance. If the giant chipmaker fails to deliver, or even just meets expectations, \u201cI think it\u2019s more of a risk-off environment,\u201d he said, \u201cnot necessarily fuel for rotation.\u201d\nAnalysts, on average, are predicting that the giant chipmaker will project revenue growth of more than 70% for the current quarter. Some are estimating an even larger surge. Nvidia\u2019s results and forecast also will serve as a barometer for AI spending across much of the technology industry.\nWhile there have been reports that some versions of Nvidia\u2019s new Blackwell chip lineup are delayed, most analysts believe there\u2019s sufficient demand for current products to make those snags immaterial. The company hasn\u2019t yet commented on the matter.\n\u201cNvidia is likely to solidly beat consensus and raise third-quarter guidance, with sales surpassing estimates by a single-digit percentage,\u201d said Kunjan Sobhani at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cYet concerns about the Blackwell chip delay could weigh on the upside to expectations for fiscal 2025, making management\u2019s comments \u2014 especially a reassuring 2025 outlook \u2014 critical.\u201d\nDespite the potential for near-term volatility in tech, the AI growth story remains intact, according to Mark Haefele at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s results this week as well as Apple\u2019s upcoming iPhone launch will be key catalysts to watch. Without taking any single-name views, we maintain our positive outlook for quality AI beneficiaries in the semiconductor and software industries,\u201d Haefele said.\nIt\u2019s difficult to recall a period in the past where the earnings of one company have been so focused on by the market, but that is where we stand now on Nvidia and to a lesser extent Broadcom Inc., according to Ryan Grabinski at Strategas.\n\u201cTheir respective earnings results will be a significant catalyst for the broader market in either direction,\u201d he said. \u201cA miss from Nvidia \u2014 which has an EPS contribution of 4.6% \u2014 could swing estimates materially. Broadcom, which reports next week, contributes 1.6%. A less material EPS contribution, but just as important for \u2018AI enthusiasm\u2019.\u201d\nThroughout its history, Nvidia has been in a 38% average drawdown, according to data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group strategists.\n\u201cOur goal here is not to suggest that Nvidia is doomed, but rather to temper expectations,\u201d Bespoke said. \u201cA repeat of the 1,000%+ gain already experienced by Nvidia is virtually impossible, and extreme pullbacks in a volatile stock like this can happen at any time.\u201d\nAs the earnings season winds down, BI notes that AI mentions in second-quarter earnings appear to have slipped quarter over quarter \u2014 but that\u2019s likely because companies Nvidia and Salesforce have yet to report.\n\u201cRecession references among S&P 500 companies\u2019 management and in analyst questions ticked up quarter over quarter for the first time since 2Q22,\u201d said the BI strategists led by Gina Martin Adams. \u201cStill, macroeconomic topics have taken a back seat to AI and the consumer.\u201d\nOn the economic front, data showed US consumer confidence rose to a six-month high in August as more upbeat views of the economy and inflation offset waning optimism about the labor market.\nWhile the S&P 500 is now nearly back to its all-time high in the wake of Powell\u2019s recent dovish message, underlying risk premia are still somewhat larger than before the July correction began and the previously all-conquering \u201cAI\u201d narrative still is yet to fully recover, according to Jonas Goltermann at Capital Economics.\n\u201cProvided that the US economy manages a soft landing, as we continue to anticipate, and enthusiasm around AI rebounds further, we forecast the S&P 500 will hit 6,000 by the end of the year,\u201d he said.\nBank of America Corp. clients pulled money from US stocks for the first time in three weeks, paring their exposure in the asset class that continued to hover near a record. The offloading was seen across seven of the 11 industry groups but was most prominent in technology stocks, which saw their first outflow in three weeks.\nThough the recent rally in Treasuries helped bring the stock-bond relative value comparison back near the long-term average, equities still suffer limited appeal on yields, according to BI\u2019s Adams.\nThe S&P 500 equity risk premium \u2014 the spread between the earnings yield on stocks and the yield on the 10-year Treasury \u2014 has edged back into positive territory, Adams noted. However, right at its long-term average, it is still too low to support the notion of strong forward returns like it did in the 2010-19 bull market, she noted.\n\u201cDue to the combination of higher bond yields and stocks near all-time highs, the equity risk premium suggests merely average future returns for stocks \u2014 a far cry from the double-digit annualized returns that characterized the post-financial crisis era \u2014 but still positive nonetheless,\u201d the strategist concluded.\nCorporate Highlights:\nNordstrom Inc. offered a rosier view for the current year\u2019s sales following better-than-expected results at its discount chain, the latest indication that shoppers are pivoting to off-price options as they hunt for deals.\nExxon Mobil Corp. is looking to sell a package of conventional oil assets in the Permian Basin as the company focuses on growing shale production after buying Pioneer Natural Resources Co. earlier this year.\nMeta Platforms Inc.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 21, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI, Dell Technologies Inc. DELL, Bank of America Corporation BAC and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD.\nTwo of the most sought-after artificial intelligence (AI) stocks on Wall Street are NVIDIA Corp. and Super Micro Computer, Inc. These top-notch stocks took advantage of the booming AI-empowered hardware market for quite some time, with NVIDIA and Super Micro shares surging 161.5% and 119.4%, respectively, so far this year. In 2023, the stocks rallied more than 200% each.\nNotably, the AI-enabled hardware market is well-positioned to surpass $84.9 billion by 2031, at a CAGR of 15.5% from 2024 to 2031, per Skyquest. NVIDIA, in particular, is making the most of the ever-expanding AI-driven chip market, which is poised to be $383.7 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 38.2% from 2023 to 2032, according to Allied Market Research.\nNVIDIA controls the bulk of the AI chip market, which has given the tech behemoth an imposing pricing power. Such dominance has helped NVIDIA post a stunning performance in the fiscal first quarter. Revenues soared a remarkable 262% year over year in the quarter to $26 billion. Earnings per share skyrocketed 461% to $6.12 a share.\nNVIDIA is likely to do even better due to the evolving growth avenues in the blossoming AI market. Countries such as Singapore, Japan, France and Italy are investing profoundly in AI infrastructure, which in due course should boost NVIDIA\u2019s top line. Additionally, some prominent companies in India, such as Reliance Industries and Tata Group, are banking on NVIDIA\u2019s chips to train large language models.\nWhat\u2019s more, outlays on AI chips are expected to jump tenfold in the coming years, a blessing in disguise for NVIDIA. Having said that, Super Micro\u2019s business is entangled with chipmakers like NVIDIA, which should certainly boost its share price. After all, Super Micro is one of the major producers of steadfast AI servers needed to mount AI chips that chipmakers sell.\nSo, in a way, NVIDIA and Super Micro complement each other, and they aren\u2019t competitors. Nonetheless, Super Micro recently concluded its fiscal 2024 and achieved $14.94 billion in sales, up an astounding 110% year over year.\nSuper Micro is expected to maintain this stellar performance due to healthy demand for AI servers in the next couple of fiscal years. The AI server market is estimated to register a CAGR of more than 18% from 2024 to 2032, added Global Market Insights.\nIn reality, for quite some time, Super Micro has been growing at a much faster pace than more established players in the server market, like Dell Technologies Inc. So, the obvious question is, does it make any sense to buy Super Micro over NVIDIA?\nBoth NVIDIA and Super Micro are poised to grow, but Super Micro has more room to grow since it only accounts for nearly 10% of the dedicated AI server market. Consequently, Bank of America Corporation expects Super Micro\u2019s share in the AI server market to increase to 17% in the next three-year period.\nSuper Micro, no doubt, has a long-term partnership with NVIDIA. But now, it\u2019s also making dedicated AI servers for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., and this divergence should certainly provide Super Micro more room to scale upward.\nSuper Micro\u2019s shares are less expensive than NVIDIA, which has given the AI server maker an edge over the AI chip maker. After all, buying Super Micro\u2019s shares will burn a smaller hole in your pocket compared to the NVIDIA stock.\nThis is because, per the Price/Earnings ratio, Super Micro stock currently trades at 18.6X forward earnings. However, the NVIDIA\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 48.3X.\nSuper Micro, rightfully, is a better buy than NVIDIA due to more growth potential and lower valuation. SMCI has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.\nNotable brokerage companies have also jacked up the average short-term price target of SMCI by 45.7% from the server solution provider\u2019s last closing price of $628.80. The analysts\u2019 highest price target is at $1,500.\nTo top it off, Super Micro has generated profits competently since SMCI has a return on equity (ROE) of 30.6%. Any ROE of more than 20% is generally considered very strong.\nSeparately, NVIDIA, at the moment, has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "US progressives push for Nvidia antitrust investigation",
        "Author": "  Jody Godoy and Max A. Cherney ",
        "Text": "US progressive groups and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren pressed the Department of Justice to investigate Nvidia (NVDA) over competition concerns, citing the company's dominance of the market for the chips driving the artificial-intelligence boom.\nDemand Progress and nine other groups wrote a letter this week urging Department of Justice antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter to probe business practices at Nvidia, whose market value hit $3 trillion this summer on demand for chips able to run the complex models behind generative AI.\nThe groups, which oppose monopolies and promote government oversight of tech companies, among other issues, took aim at Nvidia's bundling of software and hardware, a practice that French antitrust enforcers have flagged as they prepare to bring charges.\n\"This aggressively proprietary approach, which is strongly contrary to industry norms about collaboration and interoperability, acts to lock in customers and stifles innovation,\" the groups wrote.\nIn June, Reuters reported a deal was reached among US regulators that directs the Justice Department to oversee potential antitrust probes into Nvidia, while the Federal Trade Commission is looking at Microsoft and OpenAI.\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said the company spent billions of dollars developing AI-capable computing technology before demand existed, and is \"committed to opening new markets and growth opportunities for our partner ecosystem.\"\n\"Regulators need not be concerned, as we scrupulously adhere to all laws and ensure that NVIDIA is openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise,\" the spokesperson said. \"We'll continue to support aspiring innovators in every industry and market and are happy to provide any information regulators need.\"\nNvidia has roughly 80% of the AI chip market, including the custom AI processors made by cloud computing companies like Google, (GOOG) Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN). The chips made by the cloud giants are not available for sale themselves but typically rented through each platform.\nExcluding the cloud providers' chips, Nvidia achieved nearly 100% market share. That domination helps the company report gross margins between 70% and 80%.\nWarren, a US senator from Massachusetts, expressed concerns about Nvidia's control of the market in a statement to Reuters.\n\"Allowing a single company to effectively be the gatekeeper for the world's AI future is dangerous and poses dire economic risks. The DOJ is right to investigate Nvidia's anticompetitive practices,\" she said.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment.\nKanter said in an interview on CNBC on Friday, without discussing Nvidia specifically, that antitrust enforcers are concerned about areas where there are bottlenecks that companies could take advantage of to exclude rivals.\n\"We want a world where, one, there is room for investment and development and growth into new rivals and technologies,\" he said.\nLast year, Reuters reported that investments in the semiconductor industry were down considerably in the face of Nvidia's overwhelming market share.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York and Max Cherney in San Franciso; Editing by Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia earnings top forecast, but Blackwell delay signal hits stock",
        "Author": "  Martin Baccardax ",
        "Text": "Updated at 4:59 PM EDT\nNvidia posted better-than-expected\u00a0 second quarter earnings Wednesday, while unveiling plans for a $50 billion stock buyback, and said demand for its legacy AI chips remains strong ahead of shipments of its new Blackwell line of processors.\nNvidia\u00a0 (NVDA) \u00a0said adjusted profit for the three months ended in July came in at 68 cents a share, more than double the tally from the year-earlier period and modestly ahead of the Wall Street consensus forecast of 65 cents a share.\nGroup revenue soared 122% from a year earlier to $30.04 billion, a figure that also topped analysts' consensus estimate of a $28.9 billion tally.\nRelated: Nvidia stock price tied to 5 key items in Q2 earnings report\nData center revenue, which includes the group's main artificial-intelligence effort, rose 154% from a year earlier to a record $26.3 billion. Overall profit margins were pegged at 75.1%, just inside estimates of around 75.7%.\nLooking into the current quarter, Nvidia sees revenue in the region of $32.5 billion, again ahead of the LSEG consensus forecast of $31.7 billion.\nGetty\n\"Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,\u201d said CEO Jensen Huang. \u201cNvidia achieved record revenues as global data centers are in full throttle to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI.\u201d\nRelated: Nvidia earnings key to market rally after Fed lays rate cards on table\n\u201cBlackwell samples are shipping to our partners and customers. Spectrum-X Ethernet for AI and Nvidia AI Enterprise software are two new product categories achieving significant scale, demonstrating that Nvidia is a full-stack and data center-scale platform,\" Huang said.\n\"Across the entire stack and ecosystem, we are helping frontier model makers to consumer internet services, and now enterprises. Generative AI will revolutionize every industry,\u201d he added.\nAnalysts had expected Blackwell to begin full shipments in the current quarter, but Nvidia now sees \"several billions of dollars\" in sales over the final three months of the year.\nThe path of Blackwell revenue growth will likely be the\u00a0biggest topic of conversation on the post-earnings conference call, as the new line offers customers a full rack of chips and processors that perform at higher speed and efficiency in AI functions, while consuming less energy.\nNvidia said it executed a \"change to the Blackwell [graphics-processing-unit] mask to improve production yield.\", adding that the ramp is \"scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026.\"\nMore AI Stocks:\nAnalyst revisits Microsoft stock price target after AI reporting change\nAnalyst resets Nvidia stock price target before earnings\nAnalysts revise Palo Alto Networks stock price targets after earnings\n\u201cDeath, taxes, and Nvidia beats on earnings are three things you can bank on,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief markets strategist at Carson Group. \"Here's the issue: The size of the beat this time was much smaller than we've been seeing.\"\n\"Even future guidance was raised, but again not by the tune from previous quarters,\" he added. \"This is a great company that is still growing revenue at 122%, but it appears the bar was just set a tad too high this earnings season.\u201d\nNvidia shares, which have soared more than 160% so far this year, were marked 4.15% lower in after-hours trading immediately following the earnings release to indicate a Thursday opening bell price of $120.40 each.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of pain coming for stocks\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0 Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.\u00a0Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nInvestors are on tenterhooks as Jensen Huang\u2019s AI giant is about to release earnings. Gene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner, said in an interview with CNBC that the broader market can see a pullback if Blackwell-related delays show a wider impact on the AI chips market. The analyst predicted that it\u2019s going to be a \u201cdifficult week\u201d for major tech companies.\nHowever, Munster is highly bullish on the broader AI space for the long term.\n\u201cI still think that we are in an early innings of a 3 to 5 year tech bull market that is powered by AI, and I think all these big tech companies are going to do well over the next couple of years,\u201d Munster said.\nThe analyst said that Jensen Huang has indicated in the previous quarters that the demand for AI chips is more than what his company could manage in the short term, and if he reiterates this in the upcoming results, it would give a strong signal to investors about the AI potential.\n\u201cThere is a lot of awareness about AI but I think the significance of what it\u2019s gonna do is still underappreciated by the market.\u201d\nIn this article, we compiled the most important latest AI news and analyst ratings around major AI tech stocks. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nFundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee recently said in an interview with CNBC that despite the latest declines tech is \u201cstill in a good place because of AI\u201d and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) position should \u201creinforce that.\u201d\nHe also thinks Nvidia\u2019s multiple is attractive.\n\u201cNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is maybe 28 times forward earnings, which, for one of the most important companies in the world, it\u2019s not a high multiple. So if tech is in a good place, and then we get Fed cuts, I think it allows the overall market to expand,\u201d Lee said.\nAnalysts are bracing for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings scheduled for a release later this month. Jefferies said in a latest note that the company will smash analyst expectations for the quarter.\n\u201cWe expect another strong beat in July and strong guidance into October, with beats of about $1B for the results and guide,\u201d analysts said.\nAnalysts at Jefferies also believe the demand for Nvidia\u2019s Hopper chips is strong.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\u201cVisibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,\u201d the firm said.\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company\u2019s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won\u2019t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has \u201ctriggered a mechanical sell signal\u201d based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIf Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company.

Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\nElliot Management said Friday that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is in a \u201cbubble\u201d and the AI technology causing it is \u201coverhyped,\u201d according to a letter seen by the Financial Times.\nElliot raised concerns about the longevity of high-volume purchases of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) by Big Tech companies, suggesting that mega-cap tech stocks, including Nvidia itself, are in \u201cbubble land.\u201d\nThe hedge fund noted that AI is \u201coverhyped with many applications not ready for prime time.\u201d It argued that numerous AI applications are \u201cnever going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.\u201d\nThis commentary comes as chip stocks, which had surged due to hype around generative AI, have recently faced setbacks amid worries over the sustainability of large company investments.\nElliott also believes that AI has not yet delivered the significant productivity gains that were promised, stating that there are \u201cfew real uses\u201d for AI currently, other than \u201csummarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding.\u201d\nThe letter concluded that AI, so far, is essentially software that has not provided \u201cvalue commensurate with the hype\u201d and that the current bubble could burst if Nvidia reports disappointing financial results, potentially \u201cbreaking the spell.\u201d\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) delivered a solid report for the fiscal second quarter, leading to a wave of price target raises on Wall Street.\nOppenheimer analysts hiked their price target on the stock from $525 to $615 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the stock.\nThis adjustment signals a positive outlook for Meta's future, particularly following its second-quarter revenue results and third-quarter guidance.\nThe new price target implies a 24x multiple of the projected 2025 earnings per share (EPS), which is a 13% discount compared to Meta's peers and a 4% discount relative to the NASDAQ.\nOppenheimer's confidence in Meta is reinforced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg's focus on AI spending, which is anticipated to boost future advertising revenue and user engagement.\nBofA Securities analysts also reiterated their Buy rating with a $563 price target on Meta, highlighting it as the \"top AI play in consumer Internet.\"\nMeanwhile, analysts at Deutsche Bank upped their price target on Meta stock to $585 from $525, while maintaining a Buy rating.\nBank of America analysts downgraded Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock from Neutral to Underperform following a disappointing Q2 report that caused the stock to plummet nearly 30% on Friday.\nThe rating cut was primarily driven by a weak Q3 outlook and ongoing profitability challenges expected to persist through the 2026 fiscal year.\nBofA analysts identified several critical issues affecting Intel, including its Integrated Device Manufacturer (IDM) structure, which is seen as less competitive compared to more focused rivals like Nvidia, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (BVMF:TSMC34).\nFurthermore, the bank pointed out Intel's lack of competitive AI accelerators, which diminishes its appeal to key cloud customers. Analysts also raised concerns about Intel's significant restructuring efforts, including a 15% reduction in headcount and cuts to capital expenditures, warning that these actions \u201ccould create unintended competitive consequences.\u201d\nAnother factor influencing the downgrade is the suspension of Intel's dividend, potentially making the stock less appealing to some investors.\nDue to these concerns, BofA significantly slashed its earnings per share (EPS) forecasts for Intel for the fiscal years 2024, 2025, and 2026, and lowered its price objective (PO) for the stock from $35 to $23.\nEarlier in the week, analysts at HSBC downgraded Arm (NASDAQ:ARM) shares from Hold to Reduce.\n\"We believe Arm has one of the best narratives among our tech coverage given expectations of significant content growth from rising royalties for its smartphones and future AI markets such as AI PC and datacentre CPUs,\u201d analysts said.\n\u201cHowever, Arm shares have continued to re-rate significantly, with y-t-d appreciation of 116%, and it now trades at FY26e PE of 72x \u2013 a significant premium relative to its largecap semiconductor peers.\"\nHSBC flagged short-term earnings downside risk ahead of the ARM\u2019s 1Q25 results on 31 July, primarily due to a potential slowdown in Android smartphone momentum and a less bullish AI PC narrative.\nARM shares fell more than 20% across the last five sessions due to softer-than-expected guidance and broader tech sell-off.\nThe investment banking firm BTIG upgraded Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) stock from Neutral to Buy this week, setting a price target of $143 per share. The upward revision is based on strong market checks and an \"underappreciated Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) displacement opportunity.\"\nAnalysts at BTIG highlight Datadog as a leading player in the observability market, poised for substantial growth with innovative products and features like Flex Logs, LLM Monitoring, and Bits AI.\n\"In short, we see DDOG as the best play in the observability market with a large opportunity to gain share,\" they state. \"We also think new products and features (such as Flex Logs, LLM Monitoring, Bits AI, etc.) create a compelling long-term growth opportunity.\"\nThe firm\u2019s optimism is bolstered by recent fieldwork, which included discussions with ten partners, half of which skewed towards large enterprises. BTIG concluded that cloud cost optimization efforts tied to the broader macroeconomic environment are largely complete, benefiting observability spending.\nBTIG also noted that despite Microsoft\u2019s slight cloud growth disappointment, the general trend points to improving growth at the top three hyperscale cloud IaaS providers, suggesting a favorable outlook for observability spending.\nFurthermore, BTIG believes Datadog is well-positioned to capture additional market share from Splunk following its acquisition by Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). While this displacement is not expected to have a significant impact in 2024, it represents a substantial opportunity over the next three to four years.\nRelated Articles\n5 big analyst AI moves: Nvidia in a \u2018bubble\u2019 says hedge fund; Intel downgraded\nHedge funds grow bearish amid economic slowdown jitters, Goldman says\nDelay to Nvidia's new AI chip could affect Microsoft, Google, Meta, the Information says\n"

The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down more than 1.1%.\nStocks pulled back from the near-record levels seen on Tuesday, as investors shifted Nvidia's second quarter results after the bell on Wednesday. Following the market close, Nvidia reported earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street's estimates but shares slipped more than 5% after-hours. Nvidia's stock had been up about 160% this year so far.\nEarlier on Wednesday, shares of SuperMicro Computer (SMCI) fell more than 19% after the company said it would delay the filing of its annual report for its fiscal year that ended June 30.\nIn retail, shares of both Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Foot Locker (FL) fell by double digit percentages. Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Fran Horowitz referenced an \"increasingly uncertain environment\" for retail in the company's release.\nNvidia's second quarter results, released after the bell on Wednesday, showed adjusted earnings per share (EPS) tallied $0.68 on revenue of $30 billion.\nAnalysts were expecting adjusted EPS of $0.64 on revenue of $28.8 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.27 on revenue of $13.5 billion in the same quarter last year.\nIn the current quarter, Nvidia expects revenue of $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts had expected revenue of $31.9 billion. The company also approved an additional $50 billion in share buybacks.\nNvidia stock was down about 6% just after the release crossed.\nSalesforce (CRM) stock rose more than 2% in extended-hours trading after the company announced earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. Salesforce now sees full-year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $10.03 to $10.11, above prior guidance for a range of $9.86 to $9.94 per share.\nA decline in tech stocks led the market lower on Wednesday as investors awaited chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings report, seen as crucial to keeping confidence in the broader market aloft.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which closed at an all-time high on Tuesday, was down almost 0.4%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down more than 1.1%.\nThe Information Technology (XLK) sector was the worst performer in the S&P 500, sliding about 1.4%.\nNvidia's (NVDA) latest earnings report is set for release in just about an hour.\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley breaks down what Wall Street will be watching for: \nNvidia\u2019s announcement \u2014 the most anticipated results of the quarter \u2014 will send ripple effects throughout the tech sector as investors look for signs that the AI trade will continue to dominate market conversations into the second half of the year.\nFor the quarter, Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.64 on revenue of $28.8 billion. That works out to a 138% jump in EPS and a 113% increase in revenue compared to the same period a year ago, when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.27 and revenue of $13.5 billion.\nNvidia is the world leader in AI chip design and software, controlling between 80% and 95% of the market, according to Reuters. And it\u2019s expected to continue to hold that lead as it begins rolling out its next-generation Blackwell line of chips.\nWhile The Information has reported about a potential delay in Blackwell shipments, analysts at firms including Goldman Sachs, KeyBanc, and Loop Capital don\u2019t see that as much of a concern for Nvidia in the near term.\n\u201cOur work suggests that while Blackwell is in fact delayed as we first wrote about on [Aug. 8], it could be more like 120 days vs 90 days ... although it may not matter much as [1)] Hopper yields from TSMC continue to improve and [2)] The amount of increased Hopper production through the fall may outweigh the amount of Blackwell forgone by the push out,\u201d Loop Capital managing director Ananda Baruah said in an investor note.\nFor the quarter, Nvidia\u2019s all-important data center business is expected to bring in $25 billion in revenue, a 142% increase from the $10.3 billion the segment saw in the same quarter last year. Wall Street is expecting Nvidia to not only beat its Q2 expectations but raise its guidance for Q3, something that could be backed up by TSMC\u2019s (TSM) recent earnings beat. TSMC produces chips for Nvidia.\nWhile there have been signs of broadening in the stock market rally beyond just tech stocks, Wall Street firms that see the S&P 500 (^GSPC) reaching 6,000 by the end of this year reiterated this week that artificial intelligence, and specifically Nvidia's success (NVDA), remain a key part of their bull case.\n\"Provided that the US economy manages a soft landing, as we continue to anticipate, and enthusiasm around AI rebounds further, we forecast the S&P 500 will hit 6,000 by the end of the year,\" Capital Economics deputy chief markets economist Jonas Goltermann wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\nGoltermann added, \"Nvidia\u2019s Q2 earnings report this week will be a key litmus test for sentiment around AI and the prospects for the tech sector more broadly.\"\nEvercore ISI's Julian Emanuel, who also has a 6,000 call on the S&P 500 for year-end, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday Nvidia's earnings guidance will be a \"short-term key as investors remain skittish on GenAI demand amid low AI Adoption.\"\nFrom a macro perspective, a key driver of stocks' rebound over the past few weeks has been receding recession fears, as economic data has come in better than expected and many hope the July jobs report was more of an aberration than a strong early sign the US labor market is headed for a downward spiral.\nThis has put the August jobs report, which is set for release on Sep. 6, increasingly into the spotlight. Several economists have argued that another weak report could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 50 basis points at its September meeting.\nThat outcome, however, is not the base case for the economics team at Morgan Stanley. Economist Sam Coffin argued in a note to clients on Wednesday that a large reason why unemployment hit 4.3% in July was an unusually large increase in temporary layoffs. As the immediate shock to the Texas labor market from Hurricane Beryl subsides, Coffin believes the increase in temporary layoffs \"does not repeat.\"\nCoffin and the Morgan Stanley economics team forecast that unemployment will fall to 4.2% while the US economy will have added 185,000 jobs an increase from the 114,000 seen in July.\n\"We expect the reacceleration in payrolls to leave the Fed cutting 25bps in September,\" Coffin wrote.\nWhile investors await highly anticipated earnings results from Nvidia (NVDA) after the bell, other stocks are making big moves.\nShares of Chewy (CHWY) are up more than 17% after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. For the most recent quarter, the pet retailer posted earnings per share of\nMeanwhile, shares of SuperMicro Computer (SMCI) fell nearly 25% after the company said it would delay the filing of its annual report for its fiscal year that ended June 30. The announcement comes a day after short seller Hindenburg Research claimed, among other things, \"accounting manipulation\" at the AI high flyer.\nElsewhere in retail, shares of both Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Foot Locker (FL) fell by double digit percentages.\nFor Foot Locker, comparable sales grew 2.6% year over year in the most recent quarter, well above Wall Street's estimates for a 0.7% increase. Foot Locker's shares had been up more than 75% over the past year.\nShares of Abercrombie and Fitch, which had seen more than 230% rally over the past year, also took a breather after reporting earnings before the bell on Wednesday. Abercrombie topped Wall Street's estimates for both revenue and earnings per share. However, CEO Fran Horowitz did reference an \"increasingly uncertain environment\" for retail in the company's release. \nThe face of the AI-fueled bull market is slated to report earnings after the bell on Wednesday, and Wall Street strategists aren't downplaying the significance that Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings release could have on the broader market.\n\"With markets being back in striking distance of all-time highs, the Nvidia report could serve as a pivotal moment for stocks as we head into September,\" JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America and president of tastytrade, wrote in a note on Wednesday. \"Markets have largely regained the ground lost since July. However, the climb back has stalled a bit over the last several trading days. With so much riding on what Nvidia has to say, it's very easy to see how markets could be facing a make-or-break moment, at least in the short term.\"\nCharles Schwab chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders, a macro equity strategist who doesn't usually comment on individual stocks, noted that Nvidia's status in the market warrants attention from those who follow the market at the index level too.\n\"It's the poster child for AI,\" Sonders told Yahoo Finance. \"And I think it's increasingly important even though it is only one company because one of the themes throughout second quarter earnings season around AI that contributed to the pullback that we saw in technology, in the 'Magnificent Seven,' was maybe a timing disconnect between the [capital expenditures] associated with AI and the investments needing to be made versus the revenue generation associated from it.\"\nSonders added that all the answers to where the AI story stands likely won't come from Nvidia's earnings release, but \"you might start to fill in some of the blanks given what Nvidia is going to say, especially as it relates to their outlook.\"\nShort sellers were sitting on a pile of profits on Wednesday as shares of Super Micro Computer plunged.\nThe stock tanked during the session after the maker of data center servers said it would delay the filing of its annual report for its fiscal year that ended June 30. The announcement came a day after a short-seller report accused the company of accounting manipulation.\nWednesday's more than 24% drop in Super Micro\u2019s stock price made short sellers more than $1.07 billion in midday mark-to-market profits, according to S3 Partners data.\n\"SMCI shorts have been building their positions since SMCI was in the $900s in April but have really put the pedal to the medal since mid-July,\" S3 Partners head of predictive analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.\nShort sellers are up more than $2.85 billion in mark-to-market profits since July 15, including Wednesday's midday price move, according to Dusaniwsky.\nOn Tuesday Hindenburg Research released a report stating its three-month investigation \"found glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.\" The firm also disclosed it had taken a short position in Super Micro.\nNvidia stock slid more than 3% in morning trading as investors awaited the chipmaker's quarterly earnings release after the bell on Wednesday.\nOther megacap tech stocks also slipped, with Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) all off more than 1%.\nKohl\u2019s (KSS) shares are moving higher in early trading, jumping by as much as 7% after the company beat Wall Street\u2019s earnings expectations by $0.15 per share and raised its profit outlook.\nIn Q2, the retailer doubled down on inventory management and expenses, leading to a 9% year-over-year decline in inventory. It plans to stay \"committed to increasing inventory turns and managing inventory down mid-single digits,\u201d CEO Tom Kingsbury told investors on a call.\nAll this in an effort to be \u201ccompetitive during a very promotional holiday season,\u201d CFO Jill Timm said.\nKohl\u2019s expects to end 2024 with an operating margin between 3.4% and 3.8% alongside adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.75 to $2.25.\nThe company did lower its full-year sales growth guidance as a \u201cdifficult consumer environment\u201d persists and Kohl's customers feel \u201cthe burden\u201d of a higher cost of living, causing them to put less in their basket.\nIt now expects same-store sales to fall between 3% and 5% for fiscal year 2024, more than the previously expected year-over-year decline of 1% to 3%.\nSephora at Kohl\u2019s continues to be a bright spot for the company. Total sales for the business jumped nearly 45% in Q2 year over year, with sales growth in the low teens.\nIn 2024, the company added 140 total locations, surpassing 1,000 Sephora shops inside Kohl's.\n\u201cWe've seen a nice crossover in terms of customers that are shopping at Sephora,\u201d Kingsbury said, adding that \u201caround 35% of the Sephora baskets have another product from Kohl's in their basket.\u201d As the beauty store attracts younger shoppers, it plans to move the junior section to the front of the store.\nShares of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) added about 1% early Wednesday morning to pass a $1 trillion market cap for the first time. Berkshire becomes the first company in the US that isn't a pure-play tech company to cross a $1 trillion market cap.\nThe stock is up more than 28% year to-date.\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) stock plunged as much as 22% early Wednesday after the company said it would delay the filing of its annual report for its fiscal year that ended June 30.\nThe announcement comes a day after short seller Hindenburg Research claimed, among other things, \"accounting manipulation\" at the AI high flyer.\n\"SMCI is unable to file its Annual Report within the prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense,\" the company said in a statement. \"Additional time is needed for SMCI\u2019s management to complete its assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024.\"\nThe stock fell about 2% on Tuesday after Hindenburg said its three-month investigation \"found glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.\" The firm also disclosed it had taken a short position in Super Micro.\nRead more here. \nUS stocks stalled on Wednesday as investors bided their time ahead of chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings report, seen as crucial to keeping confidence in the broader market aloft.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC), and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were all little changed at the open.\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the booming spending on artificial intelligence (AI) development. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are a key piece of infrastructure for training and running large language models, the backbone of generative AI. Big tech companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on as many Nvidia GPUs as possible right now.\nThat's been great for Nvidia and its shareholders. Sales more than tripled in its fiscal first quarter, reaching a record $26 billion in total revenue. But that kind of growth can't last forever.\nAnalysts expect more modest sales growth of \"just\" 38.4% next year. But some comments from Nvidia's biggest customers suggest that number might be too high.\nWhile Nvidia has seen its profits soar as a result of all the AI spending, the same isn't necessarily true of a lot of its biggest customers. A step up in capital expenditures like those required to build AI data centers can be a crunch on cash flow. That's especially true if those investments don't produce an immediate impact on revenue.\nThat's the challenge for cloud providers that rent computing infrastructure to developers. The three largest cloud providers are Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. If a developer comes to one of them and needs access to compute power they don't have, it will go to one of its competitors. As a result, they need to build data centers fast enough amid the current AI boom to ensure when a new customer comes to them, or an existing customer asks for more capacity, they can serve them.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai made this clear when asked about spending on AI during the company's second-quarter earnings call. \"I think the one way I think about it is when we go through a curve like this, the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here,\" he told analysts. In other words, he's intentionally overspending right now to ensure he gets as many customers as possible. Microsoft and Amazon are likely taking a similar approach.\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms is building its own data center capacity to support its AI development. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has ambitions of turning Meta into the leading AI company in the world. And that requires having the infrastructure in place before the company's software is ready for training and deployment.\n\"It's hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future, but at this point I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new infra projects,\" he said during Meta's second-quarter earnings call.\nHis comments echo Pichai's. Meta is spending now with the expectation that it will grow into its capacity. At some point, however, it will rightsize its data centers. At that point, it will significantly slow down its spending on servers and chips like Nvidia's.\nThe reason Nvidia shareholders should pay attention to everything Pichai, Zuckerberg, and a few other big-tech executives say about their AI spending is that the business has become heavily concentrated on those customers.\nTwenty-four percent of Nvidia's total sales in the first quarter came from just two customers. Between 60% and 70% of its revenue comes from just 10 customers, according to Seligman Investments analyst Paul Wick.\nWith all that revenue highly concentrated among just a handful of customers, a single change in the capital expenditure policy at one of them could drastically impact Nvidia's results. If Alphabet or Meta decide to cut back on spending in a couple of years after aggressively building capacity, Nvidia will see its growth slow considerably.\nThe stock is in a precarious position, with Nvidia shares trading at valuation multiples, with around 50x forward earnings and 40x enterprise value to revenue. If it continues to outperform management's guidance and analysts' expectations, the stock will continue zooming higher. But one quarter of poor results could send shares reeling. The comments from Alphabet and Meta suggest it may be only a matter of time before there's a stark pullback in AI spending.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were under pressure on Monday, falling as much as 15.5%. As of 10:46 a.m. ET today, the stock was still down 7.3%.\nThe catalysts that sent the chipmaker lower were a combination of dismal market conditions and reports that its next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) processor might be delayed.\nIt's no secret that Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been the foundation upon which the AI revolution was built. A report that emerged over the weekend suggested that the company has had a rare fumble.\nNvidia's next-generation Blackwell B200 AI processor, which was due to begin shipping later this year, will be delayed by three months due to a design flaw, according to a report that first appeared on the website The Information.\nThe company reportedly told its biggest customers, including Microsoft, that the issue was discovered late in the production process, which could ultimately delay the launch. Some market pundits suggest the delay could cost Nvidia billions of dollars in additional revenue. The company countered, saying production is on track to ramp up later this year.\nAdding insult to injury, analysts at Citi removed Nvidia stock from the investment bank's \"upside catalyst watch,\" though it maintained a buy rating and $150 price target. This represents potential upside of 40% compared to Friday's closing price.\nLastly, the overall market meltdown, seemingly caused by the Bank of Japan rate hike, didn't help, sending fair-weather investors running for cover.\nHowever, many on Wall Street don't think the sky is falling.\nAnalysts at Bank of America maintained a buy rating and $150 price target on the stock and called it a top sector pick heading into Nvidia's second-quarter report, scheduled for Aug. 28. They went on to say that any weakness in the shares is an \"enhanced buying opportunity\" as demand remains strong.\nIt's still early days for the adoption of generative AI, and Nvidia is arguably in the best position to profit from this trend. Furthermore, while it sells for roughly 37 times forward earnings, its triple-digit revenue and profit growth justify the slight premium. That's why Nvidia stock is a buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Investors need to mark Wednesday in bright red ink on their calendar for next week. It\u2019s a day whose events could ultimately prove to be far more important than Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell\u2019s speech at Jackson Hole.\nWedbush Securities\u2019 Dan Ives, one of the most influential tech bulls on Wall Street, just began the figurative drumroll in anticipation of Nvidia\u2019s quarterly results expected for Aug. 28. Only don\u2019t confuse these with your run-of-the mill update to investors: According to Ives, they are nothing less than \u201cthe most important tech earnings in years.\u201d\nIn his view, the tech bull market lives and dies on whether underlying demand in new data-center capacity\u2014needed to operate OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, for example\u2014remains robust as ever. A miss and markets could easily see a repeat of the turbulence around Aug. 5, a day likened to 1987\u2019s Black Monday, even if Powell signaled today that rates will start to fall.\nAnd that all comes down to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. His state-of-the-art graphics processors, once used to power video games, now fuel the AI gold rush, thanks to their ability to perform computations in parallel, rather than in sequence like most central processors. Once networked together in massive compute clusters, they become powerful neural networks without which generative AI is not possible.\n\u201cThere is one company in the world that is the foundation for the AI Revolution,\u201d Ives wrote on Thursday. \u201cAnd that is Nvidia, with the Godfather of AI Jensen having the best perch and vantage point to discuss overall enterprise AI demand and the appetite for Nvidia\u2019s AI chips looking forward.\u201d\nWith investors like hedge fund Elliott Management warning Nvidia\u2019s valuations are in\u00a0bubble territory, the market will parse the report for even the slightest sign that demand for its benchmark H100 processors might be softening. Huang\u2019s company is estimated to\u00a0control 90% of the AI training chip segment.\nEqually as important will be any comments Huang makes on the transition from the current Hopper chips to the next-generation Blackwell architecture, led by the upcoming B200 chip. A report from The Information earlier this month suggested that there might be delays, a risk that could ripple through the entire AI food chain.\nCharles Liang, CEO of data-center hardware provider Super Micro Computer, has already tempered his fiscal year revenue expectations as a result.\nThis speculation came hard on the news that\u00a0major customers\u00a0such as\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0are investing in contingency plans in case they have\u00a0difficulty\u00a0getting their hands on Nvidia chips.\nMusk said last month that Tesla, in hot pursuit of a breakthrough in autonomous driving, is doubling down on its own custom AI silicon. These chips are designed specifically with vision (rather than text) machine learning in mind, but Musk has been careful not to overstate progress.\nShould Huang confirm that customers are continuing to line up for every last chip he can sell, bulls like Ives will likely feel confirmed in their thesis that the AI party is only just beginning\u2014or, as he puts it, the market is reliving the 1995 dotcom boom, not the 1999 dotcom crash.\nBy his estimate, then, market valuations are still very much in the phase where a youthful, shaggy-haired Marc Andreessen\u00a0first took Netscape public. We haven\u2019t gotten to the AI equivalent of Pets.com quite yet.\n\u201cThe stage is set for tech stocks to move higher,\u201d Ives added, predicting \u201canother masterpiece quarter\u201d from Nvidia.\nCome Wednesday, investors should have a better idea whether Wedbush or Elliott made the right call.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- It\u2019s been a rough six weeks for Nvidia Corp. shareholders. A historic dip that erased record market value from the company was followed by a four-day stretch of stomach-churning volatility. Now, though, signs are emerging the worst might be over.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA Floating Island in Baltimore Raises Hope for a Waterfront Revival\n\u2018Train Lovers\u2019 Organize to Support Harris and Walz in Presidential Bid\nPart of Downtown Montreal Is Flooded After Water Pipe Breaks\nThe Cross-Continental Race Using Only Public Transit\nClimate Disasters Are an Affordable Housing Problem\nThe chipmaker\u2019s shares have surged 17% in the past four sessions, adding nearly $424 billion in market value to one of the biggest companies in the world. The rebound has propelled the broader market higher as well, with Nvidia accounting for roughly 22% of the S&P 500\u2019s gain over that span, double the contribution of any other single stock. The gauge has since notched its best stretch since early July, a welcome reprieve to investors who on Aug. 5 were hit by the worst one-day rout in almost two years.\n\u201cThere was a lot of positive news for Nvidia out of the hyperscalers this earning season, but the carry trade impact was so massive it didn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Ivana Delevska, founder and chief investment officer of Spear Invest. \u201cNow that that technical pressure has abated, there\u2019s been a return to the fundamental story, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing this spike.\u201d\nThe rally in Nvidia took options traders who have been betting on more losses in the chipmaker off guard. The cost of protection against a 10% decline in the stock over the next 60 days is near the highest since May 2023 relative to contracts profiting from a 10% rally, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nOf course, a 17% advance in a stock that rallied more than 1,000% in 15 months before quickly giving back a quarter of the gains isn\u2019t going to allay all the worries that caused the most recent selloff. Investors remain on edge about the health of the American economy and the wisdom of tech companies plowing hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence over the next several years with little profit to show for it.\nBut for now, the selloff has attracted legions of dip buyers. Hedge funds to retail investors are bullish on the long-term trajectory of artificial intelligence and may be positioning ahead of what\u2019s expected to be a solid quarterly earnings report from Nvidia, due at the end of the month. Results from megacap technology companies so far show that some of Nvidia\u2019s largest clients \u2014 Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. \u2014 all said they plan to continue investing billions into AI infrastructure.\nThe selloff also brought down Nvidia\u2019s valuation to a level that might look more enticing to investors. Shares currently trade at about 36 times forward earnings, down from about 44 times in June. Overall, the Nasdaq 100 Index trades at about 25 times future earnings.\n\u201cEven if you expect competition going forward, the valuation doesn\u2019t look expensive,\u201d Delevska said, adding that her preferred valuation metric, which measures equity value over earnings, is near a seven-year floor.\nOther beaten-down semiconductor names are also seeing investor interest Tuesday. Shares of Broadcom Inc. climbed 5.1% and have contributed the most to the Nasdaq 100\u2019s daily gains, save for Nvidia. Applied Materials Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. all traded higher Tuesday.\nStill, Nvidia shares remain down about 14% from the June 18 record, the day it overtook Microsoft to briefly become the world\u2019s most valuable company.\n--With assistance from Ryan Vlastelica.\n(Updates stock moves at market close.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nSingapore's Wooden Building of the Future Has a Mold Problem\nInside Worldcoin\u2019s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity\nSurgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.NVIDIA\u2019s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company\u2019s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.NVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company\u2019s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company\u2019s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.Santa Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024, up 126% from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023.Beginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments \u2013 Graphics and Compute & Networking.Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.Compute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.Graphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 22% and 78% of fiscal 2024 revenues, respectively.\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Nvidia ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in August 2014 would be worth $269,533.30, or a 26,853.33% gain, as of August 22, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\nThe S&P 500 rose 182.12% and the price of gold increased 88.92% over the same time frame in comparison.\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for NVDA.\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVIDIA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 41.2% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\nShares have gained 12.47% over the past four weeks and there have been 4 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "Author": "  Eleanor Pringle ",
        "Text": "Five years ago Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was worth a respectable $3.73 billion. At the time of writing, his net worth has ballooned to a little over $92 billion\u2014and even then it\u2019s down from its high of $119 billion earlier this summer.\nWhile Huang has worked on Nvidia for more than three decades, it has only been over the past 12 months or so that the chipmaker\u2019s stock price has really begun to take off, and with that comes scrutiny.\nInvestors are largely thrilled with their bet on the Santa Clara, Calif., business, and the man Mark Zuckerberg dubbed the \u201cTaylor Swift of tech.\u201d\nBut Nvidia\u2019s meteoric growth has led some experts to question whether the company\u2019s corporate governance has matured as quickly.\nThey point to the fact that CEO Huang has been off-loading approximately $14 million worth of shares on a near-daily basis for months this summer. He still retains more than a 3.5% stake in the business.\nThis, inevitably, raises questions about why Huang is selling instead of holding.\nAnd that, in turn, leads to the issue of why Huang has so many shares in the first place, and whether his compensation package incentivizes the performance shareholders want to see.\nInvestors want more intel on the business at the top. They want to see more transparent corporate governance, open succession planning, and a change in pay structure to motivate the next era of management, according to executive compensation experts who spoke to Fortune.\nHuang is selling his shares under a very specific plan\u2014a Rule 10b5-1 agreement\u2014which allows executives and employees to buy or sell stock in their own company without violating insider trading laws by using a predetermined schedule.\nRule 10b5-1 has a number of specific requirements, chief among them that a formula for the sales (not an individual) be used to determine the number, price, and date of the trade. A third party must also be employed to conduct the sales, who cannot be influenced by the client.\nSo while Huang is comfortably removed from any concerns about insider selling, the fact still remains that he is choosing to sell after a period of high share performance and then a dip.\nThis, according to Nell Minow, vice chair of corporate governance specialists ValueEdge Advisors, is not a good look.\nMinow, who also owns shares in Nvidia herself, explained to Fortune: \u201cWhat I want from an executive [is] to be very bullish on the stock. I want the executive to be thinking all the time: \u2018Boy, this is really going to be worth a lot more soon\u2019 and not, \u2018Oof, I better sell some because I\u2019m \u2026 experiencing the vertigo of having all my eggs in one basket.\u2019\n\u201cI want all of their eggs in one basket.\u201d\nThis year isn\u2019t the first time Huang has employed a Rule 10b5-1\u2014though it is a more tenacious selloff than previous trades.\nIn September last year, for example, Huang off-loaded 237,500 shares valued at just over $117 million under a 10b5-1 trading agreement. This year, by comparison, Huang sold $323 million in Nvidia stock in July alone.\nHuang wasn\u2019t the only Nvidia exec to confirm a Rule 10b5-1 trading agreement in the April filing.\nDebora Shoquist, executive vice president of operations; Colette M. Kress, executive vice president and CFO; and Ajay K. Puri, executive vice president of worldwide field operations, disclosed similar plans.\n\u201cIt signals that the stock has jumped tremendously and they\u2019re getting a little nervous about it,\u201d Minow believes. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly concerning for investors; we ask ourselves: \u2018Well, maybe I should be selling mine, too. What are they telling me? If they don\u2019t have the confidence in the stock, then why should I?\u2019\u201d\nFortune approached Nvidia for comment on how many shares in total Huang plans to off-load, and when his selloff will end. The company did not respond to the question.\nNvidia told Fortune: \u201cMr. Huang\u2019s sales are based on a 10b5-1 plan, in which the price, amount, and dates of the sales are established in advance.\u201d\nJames Reda is a managing director at Chicago-based consultancy Gallagher\u2019s HR and compensation practice. He has worked on a number of high-profile compensation cases, from Howard Schultz at Starbucks in the early 2000s to advising on Satya Nadella\u2019s Microsoft package.\nWhy is Huang drip-feeding the sale of his stock, day after day, as opposed to off-loading larger sums all at once, we asked him.\n\u201cIf you just dump that in the market the stock\u2019s going to go down,\u201d Reda told Fortune. \u201cSo you have to be very sensitive about it \u2026 If you have a large position that some of these founders and CEOs have, it could be a better strategy.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of cases where things are executed improperly and the stock tanks. Not because people think something\u2019s going on, and all that stuff, but the excess supply. The market\u2019s confused about what they do with it.\u201d\nThe fact that Huang is selling on a near-daily basis as opposed to wider intervals is also not a surprise to Reda. The 10b5-1 plan is public, so markets will be aware of the stock influx and won't be caught off guard.\nAnd while some analysts like Minow want founders to be singularly focused on their own stock, Reda disagrees: \u201cUltimately, if you don\u2019t sell the stock you\u2019re gonna have to be like Elon Musk and some others that are putting stock up for collateral and getting these humongous loans.\n\u201cThat just makes everybody more leveraged, why do that? Peel off a little stock on a regular basis and sell it.\u201d\nA look through the SEC filings of every Big Tech company presents a range of often complex compensation provisions. Meta\u2019s Zuckerberg is famously paid a single dollar for his salary but takes $24.4 million in security costs. Apple\u2019s Tim Cook has performance-based restricted stock units in a compensation package worth $49 million. Alphabet\u2019s Sundar Pichai is given a triennial stock grant, which led to a $226 million payday in 2022.\nThe range of options also reveals a common practice in Silicon Valley: CEOs\u2014particularly founders\u2014are often continually awarded stock not only so they maintain a sense of power over a rapidly expanding empire, but also because it is a tried-and-tested method to motivate those at the top.\nNvidia\u2019s 2024 proxy filing for fiscal year 2024 discloses that Huang was paid a salary of $996,514, with stock awards worth $26 million and additional incentivized cash compensation of $4 million. His total compensation package was worth approximately $34.17 million.\nThe filing also revealed Huang\u2019s holdings in Nvidia prior to the stock sales beginning this spring, with the figure sitting at more than 93 million shares\u20143.79% of the business.\nThis is a sign that Huang has been given too much stock, Minow believes.\nIn her estimation, Huang\u2019s shares should be locked in \u201cgolden handcuffs\u201d\u2014meaning he can\u2019t sell until years after he leaves the business.\n\u201cStop giving him stock. He\u2019s clearly got too much, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s getting rid of it,\u201d Minow said. \u201cThe marginal value of additional stock grants is negligible.\u201d\nNvidia has a \u201cpay for performance\u201d strategy, per its SEC filing, based on revenue, operating income, and shareholder returns relative to the S&P 500.\nBut Minow wants more detail. She said: \u201cI would create very specific goals\u2014and this is the job of the board\u2014around market share, innovation, expansion, improving operations. Whatever the board decides the priorities should be.\n\u201cAnd let the market know what those goals are. That helps us as investors know if it\u2019s something that we want to participate in.\u201d\nThe board itself presents further potential for improvement, in Minow\u2019s opinion. Of the 12 individuals on the $2.93 trillion company\u2019s board, only one cites experience in \u201ccorporate governance\u201d in their official biography (although some of the others have served on other boards).\nMinow also wants to see Nvidia ticking off the corporate to-do list by updating the market on a successor to the CEO. After all, CEOs can\u2019t lead forever.\n\u201cHis board of directors [is] very strong on technology, not as much on corporate governance,\u201d Minow explains. \u201cI would really like to see them say: \u2018We have a process in place to make sure we\u2019re cultivating our top people, making sure we have a deep bench; here\u2019s how we\u2019re going about it.\u2019\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a name, but they need to be very forthright about the value that Huang presents and that they\u2019re taking very seriously the idea that he could just decide to go spend his money \u2026 They\u2019ve got to be prepared for that.\u201d\nHuang, famed for his never-off work schedule and endless pushes for perfectionism, is the beating heart of Nvidia\u2014and he has a price tag attached.\n\u201cHuang is the heart and soul of the company; his reputation is almost as important as the quality of the product,\u201d Minow adds. \u201cParticularly when you\u2019re talking about the [15th] richest man in the world\u2014how do you keep him motivated? It\u2019s certainly not by allowing him to diversify his holdings.\n\u201cI would give him more of his compensation in cash tied to very specific, quantifiable goals.\u201d\nFortune asked Nvidia what its succession plan was and whether it would be more transparent with shareholders about compensation practices. Nvidia declined to comment.\nA push for transparency is needed across the market, says Aalap Shah, managing director at compensation and leadership consultancy Pearl Meyer.\nSome of the pillars of American commerce have already learned this lesson: Just ask JPMorgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon, who has been open about the banking behemoth\u2019s succession planning process\u2014even naming his \u201chit-by-a-bus CEO.\u201d\nElsewhere, Morgan Stanley was subject to immense speculation prior to its selection last year of Ted Pick to replace James Gorman.\n\u201cWe should be significantly more transparent than we are currently about succession planning,\u201d Shah tells Fortune. \u201cFrom my perspective for an incoming CEO \u2026 one of the top five things they should be doing is succession planning. That to me is a company that is truly looking at the future and is appropriately considering corporate governance.\n\u201cWhen succession planning is not transparent and thoughtfully considered you have to make rash decisions, and that, from a shareholder and investor perspective, is what causes volatility.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug 28.\nFor the fiscal second quarter, the company expects revenues of $28 billion (+/-2%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $28.24 billion, which indicates a whopping 109% increase from the year-ago reported figure.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has remained unchanged at 0.63 cents per share over the past 60 days. This suggests year-over-year growth of 133.3% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s earnings of 27 cents per share.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings of the pioneer of the graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated computing surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 18.4%.\nNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up before the announcement.\nThe continued strength of its Datacenter business on the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is expected to have boosted NVDA\u2019s second-quarter revenues. An increase in Hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have been tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.\nAdditionally, the Datacenter end-market business is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. The strong demand for its chips from large cloud service and consumer internet companies is anticipated to have aided the segment\u2019s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Our second-quarter revenue estimate for the Datacenter end market is pegged at $24.51 billion, which indicates robust year-over-year growth of 137%.\nMoreover, NVIDIA\u2019s second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market\u2019s last four quarters\u2019 results had shown signs of recovery as inventory with channel partners reached normal levels. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products.\nRevenues from the Gaming end market increased 18% year over year to $2.65 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Our second-quarter revenue estimate for the Gaming end market stands at $2.77 billion, which implies an 11.5% increase from the year-ago quarter.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing 45% year over year in the first quarter. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the second quarter for the end market. Our second-quarter revenue estimate for the Professional Visualization end market is pegged at $475.7 million, which suggests a 25.5% increase from the year-ago quarter.\nFurther, the company\u2019s Automotive segment showed an improvement in trends in seven of the last eight quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal second quarter, mainly due to increasing investments in self-driving and AI cockpit solutions. Our second-quarter revenue estimate for the Automotive end market is pegged at $294.6 million, which indicates year-over-year growth of 16%.\nYear to date, NVDA stock has skyrocketed 159.4%, outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s growth of 112.5%. Moreover, NVIDIA shares have outpaced the gains of major chip makers, including Micron MU, Marvell Technology MRVL and Advanced Micro Devices AMD, which have registered an increase of 26.8%, 18.6%, and 6.9%, respectively, YTD.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNow, let\u2019s look at the value NVIDIA offers investors at the current levels. NVIDIA is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 23.02X compared with the industry\u2019s 18.97X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOver the past year, NVIDIA\u2019s revenue growth has been fueled by robust demand for chips needed for generative AI model development. NVIDIA dominates the market for generative AI chips, which have already proven their usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.\nThe growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.\nHowever, the complexity of generative AI, which demands vast knowledge and immense computational power, means that enterprises will need to upgrade their network infrastructures significantly. NVIDIA\u2019s AI chips, including the A100, H100 and B100, are the top choices for building and running these powerful AI applications, positioning the company as a leader in this space. As the generative AI revolution unfolds, we expect NVIDIA's advanced chips to drive substantial growth in both its revenues and market presence.\nAs a leading player in the semiconductor industry, NVIDIA has benefited from its dominance in GPUs and strategic expansion into AI, data centers and autonomous vehicles. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company's strong product portfolio, leadership in AI and relentless innovation present a compelling investment opportunity. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWhile NVDA stock\u2019s premium valuation might be perceived as a risk, the premium is justified due to its consistent financial performance and substantial growth prospects in emerging sectors such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing. The company enjoys high market esteem, and savvy investors should consider leveraging NVDA\u2019s potential for sustained long-term growth.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Is the Stock Market Sell-Off a Reason to Buy Nvidia Stock?",
        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Investors waiting for a pullback in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock may believe the opportunity has arrived. The stock has pulled back since peaking at just above $140 per share in June. Investors should also remember it has lost more than half of its value twice since 2018.\nHowever, the artificial intelligence (AI) stock is up nearly 2,400% over the last five years. Indeed, Nvidia has earned much of this growth thanks to its leadership in the AI chip space. But amid a sell-off in tech stocks, should investors start buying now or hold out for a lower stock price?\nNvidia began as a gaming company and is involved in fields such as automotive and professional visualization. More recently, the stock has shot into the stratosphere thanks to its work in becoming the dominant company in the AI chip space.\nAlthough Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and others have offered competing products, Nvidia is the technical leader, dominating at least 80% of the market. Also, the $30,000 or more price tag for its AI chips is far above what its peers can command in this market.\nStill, as mentioned, the stock sold off in recent weeks. Besides a general sell-off in the tech sector, the Department of Justice has hit Nvidia with multiple investigations regarding its dominance in the AI chip sector, according to The Information.\nThe same publication also reported that design flaws will delay the launch of its next-generation Blackwell AI chip.\u00a0This may have a broader impact across the tech market as cloud providers such as Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft may count on this technology to deliver some of their productivity gains to investors.\nAdmittedly, its financials may experience little direct impact. The AI chip market is expected to grow at a 38% compound annual growth rate through 2032, and Nvidia and its peers have struggled to keep up with demand.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Nvidia's revenue grew 262% to $26 billion. Also, while we will not know how it performs in fiscal Q2 until its August 28 earnings release, it expects $28 billion in quarterly revenue at the midpoint, which would amount to 107% yearly growth.\nNvidia's problem is that its stock is arguably still priced for perfection, and the lawsuits and developmental delays indicate it falls short of that standard. Given its rapid growth, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 59 may seem justified.\nHowever, other valuation metrics point to an expensive stock. Its 31 price-to-sales (P/S) ratio exceeds AMD's sales multiple of just over 9. Also, its 50 price-to-book value ratio is far above AMD's book value multiple of 4. Although Nvidia's technical lead calls for a premium, such levels seem excessive, considering Nvidia's challenges.\nWhen it comes to buying Nvidia, the answer may be both to buy now and hold out for a lower price. Here's why.\nDue to Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market, revenue and profits will likely continue to rise rapidly, even with the delayed launch of the Blackwell chips. Thus, it will probably remain a long-term winner at just about any price.\nStill, investors should employ dollar-cost average (DCA) investing instead of purchasing all at once. Considering Nvidia's recent challenges and elevated multiples, the chances of a further near-term pullback are high.\nAlso, as mentioned, Nvidia stock has lost more than 50% of its value twice since 2018. Hence, investors cannot rule out such a decline from happening again. DCA investing can serve as a compromise between owning Nvidia stock without denying oneself an opportunity to buy at a lower price.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Though Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in 2024 with terrific gains of 118% as of this writing, the recent share price action suggests that investor confidence in the stock has become a bit shaky.\nAfter all, shares of Nvidia retreated more than 20% since hitting a 52-week high on June 20. The stock's retreat can be attributed to multiple factors such as the growing fears of a recession in the U.S. following a weaker-than-expected jobs report, doubts about Nvidia's ability to sustain its outstanding growth, and concerns if artificial intelligence (AI) could indeed turn out to be a major catalyst for tech giants that are pouring huge amounts of money into this technology.\nHowever, a closer look at the monthly sales figures of one of Nvidia's key manufacturing partners tells us that the graphics card specialist could soon regain investor confidence and start soaring once again.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, is a semiconductor foundry that manufactures chips for fabless chipmakers such as Nvidia. A fabless chipmaker designs and sells semiconductors, while the actual manufacturing is done by foundries such as TSMC.\nNvidia is one of TSMC's key clients, accounting for 11% of its revenue in 2023. TSMC has been working with Nvidia to help it produce more AI chips and reduce the long waiting times. More specifically, TSMC plans to increase its advanced chip packaging capacity at an annual rate of 60% through 2026 to meet the robust demand for high-performance chips needed in AI data centers.\nTSMC's revenue in July increased 45% from a year ago to almost 257 billion New Taiwan dollars (or $7.9 billion in U.S. dollar terms). TSMC's monthly revenue increased at a much faster pace than consensus expectations of 37% growth in Q3 revenue, suggesting that it could well be on track to deliver better-than-expected results next time.\nBut at the same time, TSMC's surging revenue growth over the past three months is also an indicator of a potentially strong showing from Nvidia when it releases its fiscal 2025 second-quarter results (for the three months ended July 28) on Aug. 28. TSMC's revenue increased 30% in May, followed by a 33% increase in June, and an even better showing last month.\nAnalysts are anticipating Nvidia to deliver $28.5 billion in revenue for fiscal Q2. That would be a 111% increase from the same period last year. For comparison, Nvidia's revenue in fiscal Q1, which ended in April, was up a whopping 262% year over year to $26 billion. TSMC's revenue in the first quarter of calendar 2023 was up 13% year over year, followed by 33% year-over-year growth in Q2.\nAnd, as TSMC's revenue growth has continued to accelerate, there is a good chance that Nvidia has been able to procure more chips from the foundry giant. This suggests that Nvidia may have been able to fulfill more orders from clients. The company pointed out on its May earnings conference call that the demand for its current generation Hopper chips has been increasing, with the H200 AI chip witnessing stronger demand than supply.\nAdditionally, Nvidia says that its next-generation Blackwell AI chips are likely to remain supply constrained well into 2025. So, if TSMC is indeed increasing the output of its chips and is able to ramp up production for clients such as Nvidia, the possibility of Nvidia delivering better-than-expected numbers later this month cannot be ruled out.\nSavvy investors would do well to buy Nvidia stock before it steps on the gas.\nNvidia's recent pullback has made the stock more attractive than before. It is now trading at 61 times trailing earnings. Though that's higher than the U.S. technology sector's average earnings multiple of 41, Nvidia is cheaper than its five-year average trailing earnings multiple of 71.\nWhat's more, Nvidia's forward earnings multiple of 40 points toward a big improvement in its bottom line and is in line with the U.S. technology sector's average. Analysts are expecting Nvidia's earnings to more than double in the current fiscal year to $2.72 per share from $1.30 per share in the previous fiscal year, followed by another solid jump of almost 40% in the next fiscal year to $3.75 per share.\nThe chipmaker, however, could clock faster earnings growth if it can indeed help fulfill more orders with the help of foundry partners such as TSMC. That's why savvy investors looking to add an AI stock to their portfolios should consider Nvidia. It's never too late to buy a high-quality investment, but now could be a prime time to look at Nvidia as it prepares its earnings report.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Should You Get on the Nvidia Stock Bandwagon? 3 Motley Fool Contributors Weigh In",
        "Author": "  Justin Pope, Will Healy, and Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Do you remember where you were during the great Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) dip of 2024?\nNvidia, arguably the flagship stock of the artificial intelligence (AI) market rally, was trading at all-time highs in mid-July. Then it quickly stumbled by 20% when markets briefly turned fearful in early August. Fast-forward a couple of weeks, and Nvidia is already trading back near its former highs.\nWas the sudden sell-off a fluke, or is the Nvidia bandwagon at risk of going off the rails?\nThree Motley Fool contributors weighed in on Nvidia stock's recent momentum and whether shares are worth buying today. Here is what you need to know.\nWill Healy: Admittedly, one cannot discuss the bull run in generative AI stocks without discussing Nvidia. As the dominant producer of AI chips, it drove massive stock gains since the fall of 2022, and investors should not expect Nvidia to be unseated as the industry leader anytime soon.\nIndeed, competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm have moved aggressively into this market. But despite some setbacks, Nvidia continues to innovate with the upcoming Blackwell chip, and such updates should help it maintain its market leadership.\nHowever, it is also safe to say the market has priced this dominance into the stock. Since its low point of the 2022 bear market, the stock has risen by as much as 1,000%.\nThat rapid growth may make its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio a poor reflection of its valuation. But make no mistake; it is expensive by most measures. Its surge in the most recent bull market has taken the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio to almost 40, far above the S&P 500 average of 3.\nHowever, forecasts of triple-digit revenue growth bode well for Nvidia despite the nosebleed P/S ratio. Amid the predictions, the forward P/S ratio is 26, and the forward one-year P/S ratio falls to 19. While those ratios still make the stock pricey and vulnerable to sell-offs in the near term, they also make it less likely any pullback in Nvidia stock will be long-lasting.\nHence, investors who are not highly risk averse should not only keep their Nvidia shares but also consider gradually adding shares through dollar-cost averaging (DCA). DCA investing allows investors to have a position while leaving them open to buy shares at a lower price amid any near-term pullback.\nUltimately, Nvidia's leadership in AI chips has made it a pricey stock. Still, by employing a DCA approach, investors should be able to safely add to positions while leaving some cash available to buy more shares amid the likely price fluctuations.\nJake Lerch: Is Nvidia a great company? Yes. Does it have a wonderful future ahead of it? More than likely. Do I want to buy Nvidia shares right now? Not really.\nIn a nutshell, that's the paradox I find myself confronting with Nvidia as of this writing. I know the company has a great lineup of blockbuster products. I know its sales are through the roof, and they'll likely keep expanding for years to come.\nYet, Nvidia's stock is just so expensive. So expensive in fact that my inner-value investor keeps begging me to stop saying yes to Nvidia.\nHere's what's going on by the numbers:\nNot that long ago, Nvidia's stock sported a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio below 3. Granted, that was low, as the average tech P/S ratio is typically around the high-single digits. But today, the stock's P/S ratio is an incredible 40. Not only is that far above the average for all stocks -- including tech stocks -- it's more than twice the 10-year average for Nvidia stock itself.\nAs recently as 2022, investors could scoop up shares of Nvidia by paying 10 times sales. Those days are long gone, and that's giving me pause. Again, even on a one-year forward P/S basis, Nvidia's stock is trading at historically high levels.\nSure, the company could release guidance that blows away the current estimates and sends the stock even higher, but it could also temper expectations and leave the market disappointed. Given its current valuation, that might mean a big drop for the stock. So, I think investors who don't already have a Nvidia position should wait and see rather than jump on the Nvidia bandwagon right now.\nJustin Pope: Nvidia shareholders enjoyed market-crushing returns with relatively little stress until the stock's recent stumble. I don't know if Nvidia will be higher next month than today; nobody knows. However, the recent dip teaches investors an essential lesson about volatility: It cuts in both directions.\nInvestors can use a stock's beta value to gauge its volatility. A stock that behaves exactly like the S&P 500 will have a beta value of 1. A beta of less than 1 means the stock is less reactive to the market; it rises slower when the broader market goes up and falls slower when it goes down. A beta of more than 1 signals a more reactive stock; it will outperform the market on good days and fall faster on the market's bad days. Nvidia's beta is almost 1.7; it has crushed the market because the S&P 500 has continually chugged higher on Wall Street's excitement for AI technology. The market had a rough few days in early August, and Nvidia's stock plunged to 20% off its high.\nAt this point, Nvidia is widely known for its leadership in AI chips, so I'm not denying the potential long-term growth opportunities. However, as my fellow Fool.com contributors have pointed out, the stock is expensive today. The reality is that Nvidia remains susceptible to aggressive selling pressure if volatility returns to the broader market. I'm no fortune teller, but it's not hard to imagine the market getting shaky over the coming months. Economic data shows a weakening economy, including a massive downward revision to America's job growth over the past year. It remains to be seen whether the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates and to what extent. And if that wasn't enough, there is a presidential election just months away. The market has been remarkably resilient since early last year, but taking that for granted would be unwise.\nSo, how should investors play this?

        "Text": "Nvidia's $3 trillion market cap has prompted questions about its room for growth. But its semiconductor supplier, Applied Materials, with a market cap of $170 billion, probably has more potential.\nApplied Materials\u00a0 (AMAT) \u00a0mainly produces the complex machinery used to make chips. The company has three segments: Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets.\nThe semiconductor segment is the company's core business, generating $19.7 billion in net sales for fiscal 2023, which accounts for 74% of the total. The global services segment and the display segment contributed 22% and 3% of net sales, respectively, according to the company\u2019s 2023 annual report.\nApplied Materials\u2019 largest customers include Taiwan Semiconductor\u00a0 (TSM) , Samsung\u00a0 (SSNLF) , and Intel\u00a0 (INTC) . In fiscal 2023, Taiwan Semiconductor represented 19% of the company\u2019s net sales, and Samsung contributed 15%. Intel accounted for less than 10%.\nRelated: Big names exit Nvidia stock as AI giant stumbles before earnings\nSemiconductors play a crucial role in the AI wave. OpenAI needs tens of thousands of Nvidia\u00a0 (NVDA) \u00a0chips to develop its ChatGPT chatbot - likely a huge demand ahead. Taiwan Semiconductor, the world\u2019s largest independent semiconductor foundry, supplies at least 43% of Nvidia\u2019s chips, according to fintech firm Moomoo.\nApplied Materials shares have risen nearly 35% year to date as of August 16, while Nvidia has surged 151.6%, Taiwan Semiconductor added 72%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 19.4% during the same period.\nShutterstock\nOn August 15, Applied Materials posted its fiscal Q3 results that beat analysts\u2019 estimates.\nThe company reported earnings of $2.12 per share, ahead of the $2.03 a share estimate. Revenue hit $6.78 billion. The estimate had been $6.68 billion.\nRelated: Analyst updates Tesla stock forecast before October's key event\nFor the current quarter, the company sees a \u201cstrong pull related to AI and data center computing\u201d and anticipates its revenue will hit $6.93 billion, up 3% year-over-year at the midpoint.\n\u201cThe race for AI leadership will be determined by which companies in the semiconductor industry are first to deliver substantial improvements in energy-efficient compute performance,\u201d said CEO Gary Dickerson in the earnings call. \u201cThe value of bringing next-generation semiconductor technology to market faster has never been greater.\u201d\nIn the fiscal third quarter, the company saw a sales decline in China, its largest geographical revenue segment.

        "Author": "  Sumit Roy ",
        "Text": "The most highly anticipated event of the week in financial markets is, without a doubt, the release of Nvidia\u2019s earnings report after the bell on Wednesday, Aug. 28.\nThe AI powerhouse is expected to announce another blowout quarter thanks to insatiable demand for the company\u2019s AI chips.\nBut expectations are sky high, which means that Nvidia has a high bar to climb in order to satisfy demanding investors, who have pushed the company\u2019s stock up by almost 160% this year.\nThe most important number to watch is Nvidia\u2019s revenue for Q2\u2014as well as its forward guidance.\nThree months ago, Nvidia forecast revenues of $28 billion for the second quarter. But the company has beaten its guidance by $2 billion or more in each of the past four quarters\u2014something that many investors expect to happen again.\u00a0That means that anything less than $30 billion of revenue for Q2 could be seen as a disappointment by investors. While anything higher than that could satisfy the bulls.\nIn addition to the Q2 numbers, investors will look to see where Nvidia sets its guidance for Q3, as well as commentary on the ramp up in production of the company\u2019s next generation Blackwell chips.\nEarlier this month, media reports suggested that Blackwell chips could be delayed by up to three months. Investors will be keen to hear whether those reports were accurate and if so, what it means for Nvidia\u2019s growth in 2025.\nMovements in Nvidia\u2019s stock price could have a significant impact on all sorts of exchange-traded funds this week. The stock has a nearly 7% weighting in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which puts it neck-and-neck with Apple and Microsoft as the biggest holding of the world\u2019s largest ETF.\nIt also has an 8% weighting in the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), equal to Microsoft, and just behind Apple\u2019s 9% weighting.\nSemiconductor ETFs, like the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) and the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) also have large allocations to the stock: 9% and 22%, respectively.\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "Author": "  Bob Karr ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Automation Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other automation stocks.\n2023 was the year of\u00a0generative AI, mainly because of the widespread adoption of ChatGPT and the resulting response that followed. Now,\u00a02024 is the year in which companies have truly started using this ever-evolving technology. McKinsey revealed that AI supported the companies in both aspects: cost decreases and revenue jumps.\nIn 2024, the integration of automation technologies continues to revolutionize every aspect of supply chain management. This led to unprecedented levels of efficiency and agility. The global integrated automated supply chain is expected to reach US$25.6 billion by 2033, from US$13.4 billion in 2023, according to industry data by Market.us.\nFrom removing warehousing bottlenecks to inventory management and demand forecasting, supply chain automation reshaped traditional practices and redefined the dynamics of the logistics industry. \u00a0In inventory tracking, advanced warehouse management systems, which are powered by AI and ML algorithms, focus on optimizing inventory placement, route planning, resource allocation, etc.\nInventory tracking and management are being revolutionized through the usage of automation solutions, such as RFID tagging, barcode scanning, and computer vision. Real-time tracking technologies are offering granular visibility in inventory movements. This allows businesses to monitor stock levels, spot discrepancies, and manage understocking/overstocking. Manufacturers are now getting inclined towards smart factories.\nSmart factories reflect and demonstrate Industry 4.0 principles. They tend to leverage 5G, IoT, AI, and other advanced technologies. Experts believe that smart factories allow predictive maintenance and decision-making.\nA new theme is emerging in the field of automation, which is automated decision-making. Its adoption rapidly expanded beyond traditional sectors such as manufacturing and logistics. Demand for decision intelligence stems from data-driven and well-informed decision-making requirements which enhances corporate competitiveness and efficiency.\nAutomated decision-making is now being accepted by critical domains including healthcare and finance. In\u00a0healthcare, automation supplements the clinical decision-making processes, improves patient-care delivery, and manages resource allocation. It involves leveraging AI and ML algorithms to assess patient data, medical images, and genomic sequences, and customize patient care.\nLikewise, in\u00a0finance, automated systems continue to reshape top-notch operations like risk assessment, fraud detection, and investment management. AI algorithms assess large datasets of financial transactions and market trends to optimize investment strategies. In 2024, the software development industry is all set to embark on a remarkable transformation with cutting-edge innovations.\nThe latest technologies in software that are expected to reshape the landscape include quantum computing, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR),\u00a0big data, data analytics, 5G technology, robotics, etc.\nQuantum computing\u00a0continues to rapidly advance, evolve, and reshape scientific and industrial landscapes. Unlike classical computers\u2014which use bits as the smallest information unit\u2014quantum computers make use of qubits. These exploit quantum mechanics principles to perform complex and difficult calculations. For example, at the time of drug discovery, quantum algorithms simulate molecular interactions in a more accurate and refined way as compared to traditional methods. The integration of\u00a0quantum computing\u00a0with AI is another critical emerging trend.\nThe unprecedented advancements in robotics and AI are expected to bring revolutionary positive transformations. More and more sectors continue to understand the benefits of adopting robotics and AI. Globally, the robotics market should achieve healthy revenue growth, with a projected value of US$38.24 billion this year. The strongest segment in the robotics market is\u00a0expected to be service robotics, which should lead in market volume. Service robotics find its application in sectors, like Healthcare, Medical, Military and Defense, Logistics, etc. while industrial robots are used in Automotive, Electronics, Food & Beverage, etc.\nThe trends driving the robotics market are supported by developments in emerging technologies. These include 5G, AI, Edge Computing, IIoT, cloud, open-source, etc. Since AI in robotics continues to evolve, more and more industries are exploiting the latest technologies. Therefore, manufacturers are making data-driven decisions. Some industries use self-learning robots to execute work processes.\nSmart factories\u00a0are using AI-enabled robotics to execute smarter, reliable, and efficient processes. They help in production optimization. AI-powered robotic technologies, which include computer vision and tactile sensing, are utilized to help automate certain tasks. For example, reinforcement learning is used for better industrial assembly. The adoption of robotics, smart automation, and high-tech manufacturing will help workers with manual labor and reduce repetitive tasks.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nAverage Upside Potential: 33.65%\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the top designer of discrete graphics processing units that enhance the experience on computing platforms.\nRecently, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stated that leaders in robot development continue to adopt the NVIDIA Isaac\u2122 robotics platform. This platform finds its application in research, development, and production of the next generation of Al-enabled autonomous machines and robots. BYD Electronics, Siemens, Teradyne Robotics, and Intrinsic, which is an Alphabet Company, are using the NVIDIA Isaac Robotics Platform for autonomous robot arms, humanoids, and mobile robots.\nIn another development, Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) plans to use NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s artificial intelligence software in autonomous mobile robots. Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) will integrate NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s Al robot development platform, dubbed Isaac, in its Otto autonomous mobile robots. This is meant for manufacturing facilities.\nShares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw a decline of over ~18% over the past 1 month. Much of this decline came after reports emerged claiming that the Biden administration might put further restrictions on the exports of semiconductor equipment to Chinese markets. Apart from this, uncertain macroeconomic news (Bank of Japan increasing interest rates, disappointing employment numbers for July, etc.) weighed over broader market sentiments, pressuring NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s stock. There was also news that the company\u2019s launch of chips, which are based on new Blackwell architecture, might get delayed by ~3 months due to design flaws.\nWall Street analysts believe that this short-term news should not shake the long-term view of the company\u2019s performance. The Biden administration has not put any sort of restrictions up until now.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) recently announced that it plans to ramp up the production of Blackwell chips in 2H 2024. Experts believe that the company\u2019s current-generation Hopper chips should still sell strongly by 2024 end. By that time, Blackwell chips can become a strong contributor to its sales.\nAnalysts at Argus upped their target price on the company\u2019s shares from $110.00 to $150.00. They gave a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on 11th June. As per Insider Monkey\u2019s 1Q 2024 data, 186 hedge funds had stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nPatient Capital Management\u00a0released its second quarter 2024 investor letter and mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA).\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the firm said:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).\u201d\nOverall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of best automation stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other self driving car stocks.\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence, data analysis, and machine learning are shaping how industries perform today. These three technological advancements have enhanced the potential of autonomous vehicles and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).\nHowever, are the consumers ready to put their hands off the driving wheel and trust self-driving vehicles? Let\u2019s explore how the autonomous driving industry is progressing with almost all major automotive manufacturers investing significantly to put their Full Self Driving (FSD) cars on the road.\nAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global autonomous vehicle market is valued at $41.10 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22.75% to reach $114.54 billion by 2029. The COVID-19 pandemic hindered the overall output of the automotive industry thereby delaying the production and roll-out of self-driving cars. In addition, increased government regulations to ensure road safety have also proved to be a barrier for automakers. However, with significant improvement in software and hardware technology backed by artificial intelligence, we see automakers rolling out their Level 2 and Level 3 autonomous cars on public roads.\nFor instance, on June 25 CNBC reported that Waymo a leading autonomous vehicle company, opened its self-driving robot taxis for users in San Francisco. The company claims that more than 300,000 people signed up for the service. To cater for the growing number of users Waymo One has rolled out a fleet of 300 cars in the city.\nAccording to a survey by McKinsey & Company, automotive market leaders believe the autonomous segment to be less fragmented due to the complexity and investment involved in its operations. As per the survey, 15% of the respondents believe North America will have most companies working and deploying autonomous technology in the future. In contrast, 38% of respondents believe the European market to be led by at most two or three companies.\nRegionally speaking, China and North America are leading the race to become the first countries to roll out Level 4 highway pilot technology. Respondents of the survey are equally divided with 58% believing either country could be the first in Level 4 technology.\nAs mentioned above, developing and rolling out autonomous vehicles requires a huge investment in software technology. However, the investment is also expected to return high margins. The survey found that experts believe autonomous vehicle software is expected to have an average margin of 15% and hardware technology will add another 10% to the margin, thereby making the autonomous vehicle segment a lucrative venture for automotive companies.\nEmerging trends in the autonomous vehicle industry are paving the way towards achieving level 5 autonomy. Some of the latest developments in the industry include, the use of Internet of Things (IoT) to allow vehicles to connect with other vehicles, its environment, and the internet. This not only improves the vehicle safety by providing quick data acquisition and analysis to make timely decisions based on the traffic changes on the road. New sensor technologies such as the LiDAR scans the surrounding of the car using laser technology. When these LiDAR sensors move continuously using multiple laser sensors they create a 3D representation of the surrounding ensuring the vehicle drives safely without collision. Almost all level 3 autonomous vehicles use LiDAR scanners to enhance vehicle visibility to around 300 meters during daytime.\nMoreover, advancements in artificial intelligence such as object detection algorithms along with the LiDAR help the vehicle detect pedestrians, traffic signs, and other vehicles on the road. Other deep learning algorithms are helping improve the user experience by enhanced voice recognition, gesture recognition, and sentiment analysis to help interact with the vehicle efficiently. Last but not the least, Big Data analysis techniques are being utilized by autonomous automakers to improve vehicle autonomy through analyzing data collected through radars, scanners, and cameras.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the 10 best self-driving car stocks to buy, we looked at autonomous driving stock holdings of the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF. We selected the top 20 stocks from the ETF holdings and ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q1 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 186\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading technology company that specializes in graphic processing units and computing solutions for an array of industries including gaming, data canters, autonomous automotive, professional visualization, and much more. NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA), NVIDIA Drive Platform provides end-to-end solutions to support the development of autonomous driving technology.\nThe company posted a successful first quarter of 2025, with revenue growing 262% year-over-year to $26 billion backed by exceptional performance in its Data Center and Gaming segments. The Data Center revenue was up 427% year-over-year to reach $22.6 billion during the quarter, driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU used for training LLMs, recommendation engines, and generative AI. Management believes the automotive sector to be one of the key vertices within its Data Center segment and expects Auto to be the largest vertical driving multi-billion revenue opportunity during the year.\nThe automotive revenue of the company grew 11% year-over-year to reach $329 million and was primarily driven by the self-driving platforms. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has experienced a ramp-up in its AI cockpit solutions and global OEM customers translating to its subsequent growth in revenue.\nThe competitive edge of the company lies in its huge market capitalization and its ability to collaborate with leading automakers to deliver autonomous driving solutions. Some of the notable achievements for the company during the quarter include the successful launch of\u00a0 Xiaomi\u2019s first electric vehicle built on NVIDIA Orin.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares plunged more than 6% yesterday as global markets dropped from several negative catalysts. The selling started in Japan after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates, helping to trigger the unwinding of \"carry trades\" made by investors taking advantage of that country's lower rates. Nvidia also had some company-specific news over the weekend (see below).\nBut some investors are looking at Nvidia's drop as a buying opportunity. That's led to a rebound of as much as about 6% in the stock today. Still, the advanced semiconductor maker's stock has dropped by more than 15% over the last month. It remains a buying opportunity, even with today's bounce.\nReports over the weekend about a newly discovered design flaw in Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) platform helped fuel yesterday's sell-off. While the company didn't acknowledge a problem, it would mean only a few months' delay in the start of Blackwell sales, even if the reports are true.\nAs Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer noted in a new research note, there's still plenty of demand for Nvidia's existing Hopper series H100 chips to fill any delay in Blackwell sales. Schafer may have eased some investor concerns, writing, \"Nvidia's competitive position remains sound, and we don't expect any share loss from a minor delay.\"\nJust how robust the demand for H100 chips remains will be a focus for investors when Nvidia releases its next quarterly report on Aug. 28. Any positive comments could help the stock regain what it has given up since its record peak in mid-June. Once sales of Blackwell start being reported, there could be even more fuel to drive shares higher.\nThat is what investors are considering as they add Nvidia shares on the recent drop.

Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\nNvidia stock has fairly weathered concerns surrounding potential delays in Blackwell shipments, said Moore in a note released late Sunday. Near-term business is strong and Blackwell ramp-up will likely happen this year as per initial guidance, he said.\nMoore expects some volume in October and a more material ramp-up in the January quarter. The management is likely to stick to its script and say \"they are on track to volume\" and potentially not even acknowledge tactical setbacks, he said.\nThe shift in the timing of Blackwell shipment doesn't matter very much, as supply and customer demand have rapidly pivoted to H200, the analyst said. \"Customer enthusiasm for Blackwell is at very high levels, but the utility of a small volume of Blackwell in the initial ramp phase is somewhat lower,\" he said.\nMoore said it will take time for Blackwell's demand from cloud businesses to pick up, adding that Hopper is seeing exceptionally strong demand from this end market. At least some hyper scalers may prefer to get more Hoppers as they will need high-volume clusters of Blackwell to get relevant outcomes, he said.\nThe H20 ramp-up, Moore said, is also a meaningful contributor. H20 is the China-specific AI accelerator of Nvidia that helps the company to sidestep the U.S. ban on China chip exports. Citing checks in Asia, the analyst said H20 builds have increased to about 1.2 million units for the year, at an average selling price of $13-15k.\nAccordingly, the H20 could fetch more than $10 billion in revenue over the next three quarters, Moore said. The analyst also said fears of margin compression due to the low-cost H20s are getting blown out of proportion. \"If H200 has 80% gross margins at $22k, that would imply cost of sales of about $4400; if H20 has 20% lower costs, or about $3600, then the average selling price of $14k would still drive about 74% gross margin, much higher than some of the bear cases,\" he added.\nRead More:\nDiscover the compelling reasons behind the staggering $110.5 million price tag of this painting and explore the world of high-value art investments.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. hit engineering snags in the development of two new advanced chips, slowing the release of some products designed to extend its lead in the market for artificial intelligence computing.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHow a Tiny Midwestern Town Became a Mecca for Modern Architecture\nAfrica\u2019s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure\nNYC Subway Riders See \u2018Exceptionally High\u2019 Air Pollution\nNew York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants\nNew York City\u2019s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing\nThe delays affected the company\u2019s highly anticipated Blackwell lineup, which Nvidia announced in March, according to people familiar with the situation. A version of the chip \u2014 known as an AI accelerator \u2014 is being reworked to better work with data center infrastructure designed for an earlier chip, the Hopper H100.\nThat\u2019s a relatively small segment of the market, though, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Separately, a product that combines a processor with a graphics chip won\u2019t be available in large numbers as quickly as hoped because of problems with supporting technology, they said.\nThe snags \u2014 first reported by the Information website \u2014 reflect the challenges of speeding up the pace of innovation at Nvidia. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang is introducing new chip designs and technology more rapidly, aiming to maintain an edge in AI computing. The company dominates the market for AI accelerators \u2014 an advantage that has sent its sales and market valuation soaring over the past two years.\nNvidia declined to comment on \u201crumors\u201d about the recent engineering problems. The company has said it has begun sending out samples of Blackwell to customers broadly, and demand for its Hopper generation remains strong.\nBlackwell \u201cproduction is on track to ramp in the second half,\u201d the Santa Clara, California-based company said in a statement.\nReports about the delays contributed to a 6.4% stock decline for Nvidia on Monday, though a broader tech rout also weighed on the shares. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc., meanwhile, gained 1.8% \u2014 a sign investors hope it may be able to capitalize on the problems.\nNvidia supplies its chips to companies like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google that are spending billions on building data centers, anticipating a surge in demand for AI services.\nWhile the delays may affect the flow of the components, which are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., analysts have mostly taken the concerns in stride. Given the acceleration of innovation, \u201cbumps will continue to happen,\u201d TD Cowen analyst Matt Ramsay said in a research note.\nWeekslong delays, if they materialize, probably won\u2019t have an impact on Nvidia\u2019s rapid revenue gains or long-term growth, he said. Much will depend, however, on how quickly Nvidia fixes the issues and gets chips to major clients.\nIn May, Nvidia\u2019s Huang said that Blackwell had reached full production and would be available to cloud-computing providers later this year. He predicted that demand would continue to exceed supply for both the new lineup and its predecessor.\n\u201cWe will see a lot of Blackwell revenue this year,\u201d Huang said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a key player in the AI boom of the past two years, is set to report its second-quarter earnings for fiscal 2025 next week. Among other things, investors will largely be on the lookout for any updates from management regarding possible delays in the launch of the next-generation Blackwell (BW) chip.\nSupply chain checks suggest performance challenges, leading to a chip respin with the Blackwell tile and causing a one-quarter delay, however, this \"is not expected to have any impact to near-term results and guidance,\u201d according to KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts.\n\u201cWe believe modest expectations for Blackwell shipments in FQ3 have been backfilled with higher Hopper bookings,\u201d they added.\nKeyBanc\u2019s team expects Nvidia to report strong beat-and-raise results, driven by robust demand for Hopper GPUs.\nDue to the Blackwell delay, the chipmaker is expected to focus on ramping up the B200 for hyperscalers, effectively canceling the B100, which will be replaced by a lower-cost, performance-optimized B200A GPU aimed at enterprise customers.\nWhile the GB200 ramp has been affected, modest shipments of NVL36/72 are still expected in the fourth fiscal quarter. Despite the delay, the analysts maintain their FY26 revenue and EPS estimates of $222 billion and $5.16, respectively, versus consensus of $168 billion and $3.79.\nThey believe the risk-reward profile for Nvidia stock is favorable at current valuations.\nAnalysts at Raymond James shared similar remarks ahead of Nvidia\u2019s earnings. They anticipate another strong print from the AI darling despite the noise surrounding Blackwell delays.\n\u201cRecent commentary from hyperscale customers and results from supply chain partners point to continued strength in AI infrastructure builds,\u201d they commented.\n\u201cWe have modeled a modest contribution from Blackwell in FQ3 and expect any delays to drive upside to Hopper GPUs in the short term, which could actually benefit gross margins.\u201d\nFurthermore, Raymond James highlights the Spectrum-X Ethernet switch as a crucial near-term revenue driver for Nvidia, largely independent of the Blackwell ramp. While a prolonged delay could heighten the risk of customers pausing their spending, the analysts remain confident in Nvidia\u2019s execution capabilities.\nThey stay optimistic that B100/B200 boards will ship this year, followed by GB200 NVL rack systems in the first half of 2025.\nLastly, Citi analysts forecast a fresh 52-week high for Nvidia stock after the report, driven by expectations of higher consensus estimates for the June and October quarters, and reassuring Blackwell comments from Nvidia\u2019s management.\nRelated Articles\nNvidia earnings preview: Blackwell delay should not impact near-term results\nCanada's CN Rail, CPKC lockout workers after talks fail, sparks economic damage fears\nUS auto safety regulator closes probe into GM's Cruise robotaxis\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, NVIDIA fair value estimate is US$89.53\nNVIDIA's US$107 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate\n The US$140 analyst price target for NVDA is 56% more than our estimate of fair value\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$59.9b\nUS$80.1b\nUS$93.8b\nUS$118.7b\nUS$128.7b\nUS$136.4b\nUS$143.1b\nUS$149.1b\nUS$154.6b\nUS$159.7b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x15\nAnalyst x14\nAnalyst x8\nAnalyst x1\nAnalyst x1\nEst @ 5.95%\nEst @ 4.92%\nEst @ 4.19%\nEst @ 3.68%\nEst @ 3.33%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% \nUS$55.5k\nUS$68.9k\nUS$74.7k\nUS$87.6k\nUS$88.0k\nUS$86.5k\nUS$84.1k\nUS$81.2k\nUS$78.0k\nUS$74.7k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$779b\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$160b\u00d7 (1 + 2.5%) \u00f7 (7.9%\u2013 2.5%) = US$3.0t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.0t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$1.4t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.2t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$107, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NVIDIA as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.308. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.\nExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nThreat\nNo apparent threats visible for NVDA.\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "Author": "  Tirthankar Chakraborty ",
        "Text": "After finishing 2023 on a high note, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA squashed bubble fears, and its shares soared 155.4% year to date, outperforming the Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s gain of 113.8%. However, NVIDIA\u2019s stock price faced hiccups in early August on fears that its tech customers may curtail artificial intelligence (AI) spending budgets.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBut NVIDIA\u2019s shares did recover ahead of the much-awaited second-quarter fiscal earnings report that can have rippling effects on the broader tech sector. Therefore, investors are rightly contemplating whether to book profits and move on or hold on to NVIDIA\u2019s shares for better returns in the future. Let us, thus, look at how to play NVIDIA\u2019s shares as of now.\nNVIDIA\u2019s high-profit margin may lead to its vulnerability soon. For first-quarter fiscal 2025, NVIDIA\u2019s gross profit margin increased to 78.9% from 66.8% a year ago. However, sustaining such higher profit margins is difficult as demand-supply disparity will lessen in the semiconductor industry where peers are also manufacturing commendable competing products.\nIn a competitive environment, NVIDIA would be compelled to lower the price of its products, and profit margins could take a beating. Huawei is planning to introduce its Ascend 910C chips as early as October, which can compete with NVIDIA\u2019s H100 AI chips. Moreover, any possible trade ban on NVIDIA from selling its H20 AI chips to China may hit its profit margins.\nNVIDIA benefits from tech behemoths\u2019 spending on AI-related infrastructure. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to trim interest rates in the September policy meeting, mega-tech capital expenditure (CAPEX) spending is expected to rise, a blessing for NVIDIA.\nAI, anyhow, is a growing trend and not a temporary phenomenon. NVIDIA\u2019s strong positioning in the AI field should help its shares rise. MarketsandMarkets estimated the AI industry to grow from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion by 2030.\nNVIDIA is also well-poised to make the most of the growing gaming market through its primary gaming graphic processing units (GPU) product line, GeForce. According to research firm Newzoo, the global gaming market will generate $187.7 billion in revenues this year. At the same time, NVIDIA is collaborating with Siemens to build an industrial metaverse, a market that is expected to reach $228.6 billion in 2029 from $28.7 billion in 2024, per MarketsandMarkets.\nMeanwhile, rumors regarding the production delay of NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell AI chips may have caused a lot of concerns. But NVIDIA recently confirmed that Blackwell sampling has begun, and the next-generation chips will be launched later this year. NVIDIA is the worldwide leader in AI chip design and software, giving the company a competitive edge over its rivals.\nWhat\u2019s more, NVIDIA is yet again expected to post encouraging earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which may help its share prices to climb. NVIDIA is projected to report earnings per share of $0.63 for the fiscal second quarter, more than $0.27 a year ago, indicating a jump of 133.3%.\nNVIDIA has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 18.4%, a tell-tale indication that the stock has a reasonable chance to display earnings growth in the forthcoming earnings release on Wednesday, after the bell.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nDespite the positives, buying the NVIDIA stock may burn a hole in your pocket. This is because the unquenchable demand for AI models and dominance in GPUs has made the NVIDIA stock expensive.\nBy looking at the price/earnings ratio, NVIDIA stock currently trades at 46.9X forward earnings. However, NVIDIA\u2019s rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Texas Instruments Incorporated\u2019s TXN forward earnings multiples are 44.6X, 16.9X, 33.8X and 40.7X, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHence, astute investors should wait to buy on the dips. And those who have already bought NVIDIA\u2019s shares should hang on to it. After all, NVIDIA stock is for the long run, as AI is here to stay. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Upgrade today!\nEvercore ISI analysts recommend buying Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock ahead of the chipmaker\u2019s upcoming earnings report for the July quarter, saying that recent worries about potential delays in the release of the Blackwell system are \u201coverdone.\u201d\nThe investment bank emphasizes that demand for Nvidia's systems remains strong, as highlighted by a 20% quarter-on-quarter increase in hyperscale capital expenditure (CapEx) during Q2 2024. Looking forward, CapEx is anticipated to grow by an additional 8% in Q3 and 10% in Q4.\nEarlier reports indicated that Nvidia\u2019s much-anticipated Blackwell system, which features its next-generation AI chips, might face delays of up to three months. This news sparked investor concerns over the sustainability of Nvidia's stock rally.\nEvercore analysts reviewed past Nvidia product disruptions in 2008, 2022, and 2023, concluding that while a negative announcement could result in a short-term stock drop of 5%-10%, Nvidia has consistently shown resilience in quickly developing alternative solutions.\n\u201cFurthermore, should a delay manifest, we believe demand is so strong, particularly at Tier 2 and 3 CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) and enterprises, that current generation Hopper solutions would be purchased even if Blackwell was pushed,\u201d the analysts remarked.\nEvercore continues to view Nvidia as its \u201cTop Tectonic Shift in Computing pick,\u201d asserting that the company is well-positioned to capture up to 80% of the value in the parallel processing era. Analysts also project that Nvidia could achieve more than $10 in earnings per share (EPS) by 2030 \u201cand that it could ultimately grow to be 10-15% weighting of the S&P 500 Index.\u201d\nThey have raised their estimates for Nvidia\u2019s third-quarter and 2024 performance, along with increasing its target price for the stock from $145 to $150.\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is positioned to be a significant player in the AI space, but this potential is already factored into its stock price, MoffettNathanson said in a note to clients.\nThe firm, which initiated coverage of Apple with a Neutral rating and set a price target of $211 per share, acknowledged Apple's strong AI strategy but noted that the market has already anticipated and priced in these developments.\n\"Apple is poised to win in AI,\" MoffettNathanson analysts said, but cautioned that \"that's exactly what's already priced in.\"\nThey observed that despite earlier concerns about Apple lagging in AI, the market has consistently shown confidence in the company's strategy. This was particularly evident after the World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC), where Apple confirmed much of its AI plans.\n\"By the time of their June WWDC, the broad strokes of Apple's 'contextual awareness' AI strategy were already well-anticipated by the tech intelligentsia, and hence by the market as well,\" the note states.\nMoffettNathanson emphasized that Apple's AI approach leverages the trust of its over one billion users, especially in handling personal data like contacts and emails, which remain exclusively under Apple's control.\nThe firm also said that Apple's strategy is likely to drive an iPhone upgrade cycle, but the potential impact of this cycle is already reflected in the current stock valuation.\n\"Apple\u2019s new AI functionality would be presented in service of driving an iPhone upgrade cycle \u2013 Apple is, after all, still primarily a hardware provider \u2013 as capitalizing on resident inference capabilities would require at least 8 GB of RAM and a neural processor that phones older than the iPhone 15 Pro don\u2019t have,\" they explained.\nEarlier in the week, analysts at Edward Jones initiated research coverage of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) with a Buy rating and added the semiconductor giant to its Stock Focus List.\nThe firm sees multiple catalysts that could drive significant growth for AMD in the coming years.\nA key factor behind Edward Jones' optimistic outlook is the rising demand for data center infrastructure, which is expected to propel sales of AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs).\nThe analysts highlighted that \"growing demand for data center infrastructure should help drive accelerating sales\" of these critical products.\nAnother driver of Edward Jones' bullish stance is AMD's acquisition of Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX).\n\"While the acquisition of Xilinx adds new programmable chip products and end-markets to AMD's business, we believe the company remains in the early innings of cross-selling and integrating Xilinx and AMD products,\" the firm stated.\nThe integration of Xilinx\u2019s programmable chip products with AMD\u2019s existing offerings is still in its early stages, but Edward Jones sees significant potential for cross-selling opportunities, which management estimates could be worth as much as $10 billion.\nIn addition, the firm points to the potential for a prolonged upgrade cycle in the PC market driven by AI-enabled PCs, which could further support AMD's growth.\nAnalysts believe that the positive outlook for AMD is \"not fully reflected in the share price,\" presenting an attractive investment opportunity at current levels.\nShares of Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) fell Friday after Bank of America analysts issued a double downgrade on the NAND flash controller supplier.\nThey cut their rating on SIMO stock from Buy to Underperform, citing expectations of limited growth following the upturn in the first half of 2024.\nAnalysts pointed out that the company\u2019s guidance for the second half already indicates minimal top-line growth compared to Q2 2024. Their updated analysis also suggests low growth in 2025 for sales, operating profit (OP), and earnings per share (EPS).\n\"A key reason is likely the low exposure to AI and enterprise SSD, areas more dominated by Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and SK Hynix, respectively,\u201d analysts wrote.\nBofA has also reduced its EPS estimates for the second half of 2024 and 2025 by approximately 20%, driven by lower revenue and operating margin assumptions compared to their earlier forecasts.\nThe investment bank highlighted that SIMO\u2019s revenue primarily comes from \u201ccontroller IC chips\u201d for NAND products, setting it apart from its competitor, Phison Electronics.\nGiven the expectation of limited growth beyond the first half of 2024, the analysts have lowered their price objective for SIMO to $60 from $90.\nMore broadly, BofA also noted that while demand for AI server chips remains strong, demand for commodity memory has significantly weakened.\nBernstein analysts on Friday downgraded Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) from Outperform to Market Perform following the company's latest earnings report and cut their price target from $130 to $97.\nThe analysts foresee the stock trading sideways due to increasing disruption and reduced clarity on future prospects.\n\"We expect more disruption to the near-term Search results and any limited signs of success in next few quarters (that would have allowed investors to look through to the longer term),\" they noted.\nThe firm also lowered its Search growth expectations by 5 percentage points for the second half of 2024 and by 3 percentage points for 2025, currently valuing the stock on a bearish outlook without factoring in any potential gains from AI Search initiatives.\n\"AI Cloud and Robotaxi are positive, but without Search showing a revival, we expect that shares will remain under pressure,\" Bernstein analysts added.\nRelated Articles\n5 big analyst AI moves: Buy Nvidia stock ahead of earnings; BIDU downgraded\nBreaking down Morgan Stanley's list of top European stocks to own\n2025 a likely headache for OPEC\n"

        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is slated to report its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended July 28, 2024) on Wednesday, Aug. 28, after the market close.\nNvidia's upcoming earnings release is widely considered the most anticipated of this quarterly earnings season. That's because the company is viewed as a bellwether, or indicator, for the AI space and the overall market.\nNvidia dominates the rapidly growing AI chip market. If it delivers stronger-than-expected results \u2014 particularly in its AI-driven data center business \u2014 that suggests the broad AI market is probably more robust than widely believed.\nNvidia stock's performance has also become an indicator of the likely strength of the overall market. Nvidia is the second-largest stock on the S&P 500 index (behind Apple) and has been skyrocketing since early 2023, so it's been a huge driver of the index's overall performance.\nMy two-part prediction is that (1) Nvidia will beat Wall Street's earnings estimate, and (2) it will do so by at least 10%. We will get to where the 10% came from.\nMetric\nQ2 Fiscal 2024 Result\nNvidia's Q2 Fiscal 2025 Guidance\nNvidia's Projected Growth\nWall Street's Q2 Fiscal 2025 Consensus Estimate\nWall Street's Projected Growth\nRevenue\n$13.51 billion\n$28 billion\n107%\n$28.68 billion\n112%\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS)\n$0.27*\n$0.622**\n130%\n$0.64\n137%\nData sources: Nvidia and Yahoo!

This data goes back to the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which ended in late July 2020. Below is the summary.\nPeriod\nPeriod Description\nEarnings* Results Relative to Wall Street's Consensus Estimate\nMagnitude of Earnings Beat (Average)\nMagnitude of Earnings Beat (Range)\nMost recently reported 16 quarters\nFull data set\n14/16 beats = 88%\n12%\n5% to 32%\n11 quarters, starting six quarters ago and going back\nData set period prior to generative AI being called out as a major growth driver\n9/11 beats = 82%\n8%\n5% to 14%\nMost recently reported five quarters\nPeriod in which generative AI has been a major growth driver\n5/5 beats = 100%\n18%\n10% to 32%\nData source: Nvidia.

In the last five quarters \u2014 the generative AI era \u2014 the company's earnings beat has generally decreased in size: 10% (most recent), 12%, 19%, 32%, and 18%. So, I'm using the smallest earnings beat as my prediction. I'm using the smallest and not, say, the average because of the trend in the data.\nSince generative AI entered the scene, Nvidia's earnings beats have become notably bigger (averaging 18%). I think this trend will continue.\nThe data in this article weakens the argument that goes something like: \"Nvidia stock is overvalued because its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is X.\" (The forward P/E is 46.2, as of Aug. 26.) A forward P/E uses an estimate for the earnings value, generally Wall Street's. And those estimates are likely notably too low, which inflates the forward P/E.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were heading lower Thursday after the AI chip leader posted better-than-expected results in its fiscal 2025 second-quarter report after the close Wednesday, but the company's beat was not as wide as investors had become used to and management's guidance was on the lighter side. Nvidia also reported a sequential decline in gross margin, indicating that it may have reached the limits of its margin expansion.\nThe stock was down by 6.4% as of 3:14 p.m. ET, though many of its AI peers such as Arm Holdings rose, suggesting that some investors were interpreting the report as good news for AI demand broadly, and taking the opportunity to rotate into other AI stocks with more upside.\nNvidia delivered another strong quarter: For the period that ended July 28, revenue was up by 122% year over year to $30 billion and adjusted earnings per share soared by 152% to $0.68, both of which beat analysts' consensus estimates.\nHowever, its gross margin slipped from 78.4% to 75.1%, which the company blamed on new data center products and inventory write-downs related to the Blackwell platform. It was the first time that Nvidia's gross margin had shrunk in the generative AI era, and it seems to be a sign that its margin expansion has probably peaked.\nNvidia's fiscal third-quarter guidance also seemed a bit underwhelming. Management forecast revenue of $32.5 billion, and while that was ahead of the consensus figure of $31.8 billion, it would amount to just 8% sequential revenue growth.\nThe company expects to launch its Blackwell platform in fiscal Q4, and that could be causing a modest headwind to Q3 demand.\nIt makes sense for Nvidia stock to take a breather. After all, it's up by nearly 1,000% since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.\nIt now has a market cap of $3 trillion, just behind Apple and Microsoft in the race for the title of the most valuable company in the world, and the expected soaring growth it will experience from AI, at least over the next few quarters, is largely baked into its stock price. It trades at a forward P/E ratio of 43, which is expensive, but reasonable.\nThursday's pullback seems like a good opportunity for long-term investors to scoop up shares of Nvidia, as the company still dominates the AI hardware landscape. However, investors may also want to take a cue from those who are rotating out of the stock into AI alternatives like Arm Holdings.\nWith its $3 trillion valuation, Nvidia's upside potential is more limited than that of companies like Arm, especially with its gross margin falling and its sequential growth decelerating.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "NVIDIA NVDA reported outstanding results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, with revenues of $30.04 billion topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.72%. The top line increased 122% year over year and 15% quarter over quarter. Adjusted EPS came in at 68 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents per share. \u00a0This compares to earnings of 27 cents per share a year ago.\nThe data center segment, crucial for AI applications, drove much of NVIDIA's growth, with revenues reaching $26.3 billion, up 154% year over year and 16% sequentially. NVIDIA's gross margin was 75.1%, slightly down from the previous quarter due to factors like inventory provisions. Despite this, the company's pricing power remains robust.\nNVDA Stock Down Post Superb Earnings: What\u2019s Wrong?\nThe NVIDIA stock was down 6.9% in aftermarket hours on Aug. 28, 2024, despite superb results. Let\u2019s find out what went wrong. In the last three successive quarters, NVIDIA recorded revenue growth of more than 200%, and its ability to top estimates is at greater risk as success in each quarter leads Wall Street to raise the bar even higher, per Reuters.\nAgreed, CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged the strong demand for Hopper chips. Huang also anticipates significant revenues from the upcoming Blackwell architecture. But media reports hinted at the fact that the new Blackwell chips might be delayed by as much as three months due to design flaws, as quoted on a Motley Fool article.\nNVIDIA expects Blackwell production to ramp up in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. Overall, NVIDIA's stock fell in after-hours trading, reflecting high investor expectations and concerns about sustained growth rates. Concerns also remain about slow returns from generative AI investments.\nAnother Motley Fool article revealed that NVIDIA\u2019s revenue growth will slow down from the triple-digit pace at which it has been growing recently. Prior to the earnings release, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA\u2019s current-year revenues was pegged at $118.70 billion, up 94.8% year over year. The next year\u2019s revenue estimate was pegged at $156.9 billion, up 32.2% from the current year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPrior to the earnings release, NVIDIA\u2019s earnings estimate for the current year was pegged at $2.71, up 108.5% year over year. The next year\u2019s earnings estimate was pegged at $3.44, up 27% from the current year. Hence, we can expect a growth slowdown in NVIDIA next year, although it appears strong in the current year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhat Lies Ahead for NVDA Stock?\nNVIDIA stock\u2019s Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio (trailing 12 months) stands at 71.28X versus the underlying Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s P/E of 8.23X. The last five years\u2019 growth rate for NVIDIA was 54.20% versus the underlying industry\u2019s growth rate of 9.10%. This exponential growth rate of NVIDIA explains its ripe valuation.\nFor the next five years, NVIDIA\u2019s growth rate is expected to be 37.60% versus the industry\u2019s growth rate of 16.80%. With slower growth expected for the coming fiscal years, NVIDIA's forward P/E ratio would decline.\nPer Motley Fool, \u201cif it were to grow revenue 30% in fiscal year 2028, a multiple of 30 to 40 times on the stock in 2027 would seem reasonable. That would value the stock between $200 and $270 per share in three years. As such, there is a good possibility that Nvidia's stock could once again double from where it is now in three years.\u201d\nShareholder\u2019s Value Maximization by NVDA\nNvidia is increasing its returns to shareholders. The board of directors approved an additional $50 billion in share buybacks, adding to the $7.5 billion remaining on its existing authorization.\nNVDA ETFs in Focus \nIf you are worried about NVIDIA\u2019s prospective slowing growth trajectory and still take advantage of the AI boom, you can stay invested in the NVDA-heavy semiconductor exchange-traded funds (ETF). The ETF approach minimizes the company-specific concentration risks.\nSome NVIDIA-heavy ETFs include Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), Grizzle Growth ETF DARP and TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF LRNZ.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock: Time to Sell?",
        "Author": "  Daniel Sparks, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen its stock recover nicely from a pullback in late July and early August. Shares have gone from trading at levels below $100 earlier this month to around $124, as of this writing. That's approximately a 25% gain in a very short period. With so much change so fast, investors who bought the dip or who have been holding from much lower levels earlier this year may be debating whether it might make sense to take their profits and move on.\nThe decision about whether the stock should be sold at this level is not an easy one. The company, which creates graphic processing units (GPUs) powering the deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) craze, trades at 74 times earnings -- a high premium. But Nvidia's underlying business fundamentals are incredible; revenue in the company's most recent quarter soared 262% year over year, and earnings per share skyrocketed 629% over the same period.\nHere's a closer look at both the bull and bear cases for the stock to help investors decide for themselves what they should do.\nInvestors bullish on the stock quickly point out that the company's impressive top-line growth is likely to persist for some time. This, bulls say, is evidenced by the fact that demand for the company's flagship H200 and Blackwell chips remains ahead of supply. Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress even noted in the company's most recent earnings call that the company expects demand for these products to \"exceed supply well into next year.\"\nFurther, Nvidia bulls might point to the company's revenue guidance for its fiscal second quarter of 2025 to show how growth is continuing. Management forecast fiscal second-quarter revenue of $28 billion, a figure translating to more than a doubling of revenue and likely even faster earnings-per-share growth. Momentum like this will likely help quickly bring down Nvidia's high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\nFundamental to the bear case for Nvidia stock is the fact that the market is forward looking -- particularly when dealing with stocks trading at high premium valuations. This means that Wall Street may severely punish Nvidia shares if it starts seeing evidence of potential future deterioration of revenue growth rates or earnings. A simple comment from management during an earnings call about demand and supply for Nvidia's key products getting closer to equilibrium, therefore, could spook investors and cause them to no longer believe the stock deserves a valuation multiple as high as it currently commands.\nFurther, what appears to be Nvidia's strength today -- its high profit margin -- is the same factor that makes it vulnerable. For instance, the company's gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 impressively expanded from 66.8% in the year-ago quarter to 78.9%. However, a higher-than-usual gross margin means normalization could occur in the future as demand catches up to supply and as competitors do a better job making competing products.\nIn an environment like this, Nvidia may have to lower the price of its products, and its margins could take a hit. This could lead to not only a slowdown in earnings but possibly even a decline.\nHeadwinds to Nvidia's margins and earnings growth (if they ever materialize) could be more than a year away. But a forward-looking market could start pricing in these risks any moment.\nOverall, Nvidia seems like a great company, but a risky stock at this price. Selling shares and buying something more attractive may make sense.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Investing.com-- Asian chipmaking stocks fell on Thursday, tracking overnight losses in market darling Nvidia after the chipmaker\u2019s guidance on revenue and margins underwhelmed, raising concerns over the AI trade.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell as much as 8.5% in after-hours trade as an underwhelming outlook on current quarter revenue and gross margin largely eclipsed an earnings beat and a $50 billion buyback from the chipmaker.\nCEO Jensen Huang also confirmed earlier reports that the firm was facing difficulties in producing its most advanced line of artificial intelligence chips, called Blackwell.\nThe news sparked steep losses in Nvidia\u2019s stock, with losses spilling over into Asia, where several chipmakers have direct exposure to the AI giant.\nSouth Korea\u2019s SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) was the worst performers of the lot, dropping 5.6% even as it unveiled a new generation of memory chips aimed at reducing power requirements. SK Hynix is a key supplier of advanced memory chips to Nvidia.\nPeer Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930), which is also vying to supply Nvidia with memory chips, fell 2.8%.\nTaiwan\u2019s TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM)- the world\u2019s biggest chipmaking by foundry capabilities and a major Nvidia supplier- fell 2.4% in Taipei trade, after its U.S. shares sank over 3%. Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn (TW:2317), another major Nvidia supplier, fell more than 2%.\nJapanese semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest Corp. (TYO:6857) lost 0.9%, while Tokyo Electron Ltd. (TYO:8035), the country\u2019s biggest chipmaker, fell 1.5%.\nIn China, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK:0981)- the country\u2019s biggest chipmaker and a local competitor for Nvidia, fell 1.3%.\nLosses spilled over from chipmaking stocks and into the broader technology sector, as Nvidia\u2019s underwhelming outlook raised questions about just how profitable the so-called \u201cAI trade\u201d was bound to be in the long run.\nBefore Nvidia, middling earnings from several of its tech peers on Wall Street had pointed to rising costs and relatively muted returns from investment in AI.\nThis notion weighed on broader Asian tech stocks on Thursday. China\u2019s BAT (LON:BATS) trio of Baidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU), Alibaba (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700)- all three of which have ongoing AI programs- fell between 1% and 3% in Hong Kong trade.\nJapan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO:9984)- which is exposed heavily to AI through its tech investments- fell about 2%. Softbank\u2019s unit- the British chip designing firm Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM)- had fallen sharply on Wednesday and extended its losses after Nvidia\u2019s earnings.\nRelated Articles\nAsian chipmaking stocks sink tracking Nvidia losses\nAsian shares track Wall Street futures lower as Nvidia disappoints\nAustralia's CBA chief blasts MP for 'misinformation' on card payment charges\n"

        "Author": "  Johnny Rice ",
        "Text": "By now you probably know that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the hottest stock in tech. The company's rapid ascent from gaming chipmaker to poster child of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and one of the largest public companies in the world has been nothing short of remarkable.\nAfter its stock nearly tripled since the beginning of the year, it retreated about 8% from its peak in June. Fear not. I think it's still got a lot of room to run. If anything, this is a buying opportunity.\nNvidia's incredible revenue growth is being driven largely by a handful of companies like Amazon and Microsoft that operate \"hyperscale\" data centers (or \"hyperscalers\") \u2014 really, really, really big server farms. The companies are upgrading and expanding them in order to keep up with the massive and specialized computing resources demanded by AI. Nvidia's superchips power them. Yes, there are other players, but Nvidia dominates the market.\nThe good news for Nvidia? This firehose of cash doesn't seem likely to be shut off any time soon. During recent earnings calls, CEOs from the companies that run these hyperscalers reiterated the need to continue \u2014 and even expand \u2014 AI-focused capital expenditures (capex). Alphabet spent roughly $31 billion on capex in 2023. This year, that figure could reach $50 billion \u2014 a colossal increase. And Alphabet isn't alone.\nAlphabet's CEO, Sundar Pichai, summed up big tech's attitude toward these investments like this: \"The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here.\" This messaging was echoed by almost every CEO leading a hyperscaler. Nvidia is likely to enjoy substantial cash inflows for the foreseeable future. Of course, it will need to fend off competitors, but it is well positioned to do so.\nNow, that's business as usual. What's Nvidia's next big move?\nData centers are incredibly complex, especially those built for AI. At the heart of these systems are the chips that perform the computations. This is the market Nvidia dominates. However, all this high-powered computing creates massive amounts of data, and that data needs to be transported. This is where networking infrastructure comes in.\nThe standard for networking in most data centers has been ethernet, but the demands of AI computing are too great for the technology. Companies needed to retrofit their data centers with a different networking technology like InfiniBand to keep up. This is extremely costly, but Nvidia has an answer. It recently released its Spectrum-X platform, which allows data centers to remain ethernet-based and run advanced AI. This represents a large new revenue stream for the company.\nLast quarter, Nvidia made close to $20 billion from its chips and $3 billion for its networking products. Mordor Intelligence estimates that the total market for data center networking infrastructure is about $26 billion in 2024 and it forecasts the space to grow at an 18% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2029. There is significant room to grow in this arena.\nThere is competition, however. Broadcom is already a major player. Nvidia is unlikely to dominate this space as it has with the chip market. However, this new ethernet-based approach could be a game changer. A bigger share of the market is very possible.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "As I expected, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) rocket-ship rally is beginning to stall, with shares down by roughly 21% over the last 30 days. And while Nvidia is still a great company, the combination of a high valuation and low diversification leaves room for continued downside. Let's explore how recession fears and artificial intelligence (AI) fatigue could play out over the next three years. \nIt is impossible to predict a recession for sure, but data is pointing toward a possible slowdown in economic activity. In July, the U.S. only added 114,000 jobs compared to expectations of 175,000, while the unemployment rate hit 4.3% -- its highest level since 2021. And while the Federal Reserve is expected to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, it might be too little too late to avoid a so-called hard landing. Rate cuts can be a helpful tool, but they can't magically fix every problem in a shaky economy.\nFor Nvidia, a recession could be a disaster. While the company has dominated the AI industry by producing cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to run and train these complex conversational algorithms, it can't prevent its business model from being undermined by macroeconomic factors outside its control. \nNvidia's business has historically been cyclical. When money is tight, consumers are less likely to spring for expensive computer upgrades, instead opting for cheaper used options -- or foregoing them altogether. While a shift to enterprise-level hardware shields Nvidia from the whims of PC gamers, similar dynamics could also arise in the market for AI chips.\nAnalysts are beginning to sound the alarm about the billions being spent on AI hardware with limited results on the bottom line. Goldman Sachs analyst Jim Covello puts the situation in stark terms, stating: \"Despite its expensive price tag, the technology is nowhere near where it needs to be in order to be useful. Overbuilding things the world doesn't have use for, or is not ready for, typically ends badly.\"\nWhile tech companies are content to speculate on unprofitable AI investments when the economy is good, the current level of spending may not hold up when conditions weaken. During recessions, businesses usually downsize their non-essential and non-profitable segments first, and right now, AI seems to fit solidly into that troubled category. \nNvidia's first-quarter revenue jumped 262% to $26 billion, driven by data-center chip sales, which rose by an eyewatering 427% to $22.6 billion. But while this growth is impressive, it puts most of Nvidia's financial eggs in one basket. Data-center sales now represent 87% of total revenue driven by a few flagship products, such as the A100 and H200, which power typical large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT.\nOther segments, like gaming (10% of revenue) or professional visualization (2% of revenue), have faded into irrelevance in the current market, making Nvidia vulnerable to any potential slowdown in demand for AI accelerator chips.\nAfter rising by over 450% over the last three years, Nvidia stock has historically been a spectacular investment. And there is still a lot to love about the company because of its industry leadership in the global-chip industry. That said, shares seem to have peaked for now. \nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 42, Nvidia's valuation prices in future growth that may not materialize, especially if the U.S. economy begins to slow and enterprise clients start to rethink their massive AI chip purchases. Nvidia looks overexposed to this fragile industry and may experience a major correction in the coming years.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sheraz Mian ",
        "Text": "The Q2 earnings season has effectively come to an end, with results from more than 95% of S&P 500 members already out, with even most of the major Retail sector results known by now. That said, this week\u2019s line-up of quarterly results from more than 140 companies, including 15 from S&P 500 members, includes quarterly results from the only Magnificent 7 member yet to report results, Nvidia NVDA.\nOther notable companies reporting results this week include Salesforce CRM, Lululemon LULU, Best Buy BBY and others.\nNvidia has established itself as a true leader of the coming artificial intelligence (AI) economy, with the company\u2019s chips as the only game in town when it comes to running the highly complex and demanding computations. This leadership has allowed Nvidia to consistently come out with beat-and-raise quarterly reports in recent quarters.\nWe will see if the company can maintain this operating momentum when it reports results after the market\u2019s close on Wednesday, August 28th. Estimates for the period have essentially remained unchanged in recent weeks, which is unusual relative to what we have been seeing in other recent quarters.\nNvidia is expected to bring in $0.63 in EPS on $28.2 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year gains of +133.3% and +109%, respectively. You can see the long-term Nvidia revisions trend in the below Price, Consensus & Surprise chart.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia shares were hit hard in the market\u2019s recent down draft, but have effectively recouped most of those losses. The stock has more than doubled this year and handily outperformed the Zacks Tech sector, the broader market, and the Mag 7 stocks, as the chart below shows.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe biggest driver of the stock\u2019s performance from here onwards will be management guidance for the current and upcoming quarters, as well as the market\u2019s assessment of the company\u2019s ability to ramp up production of the Blackwell chips. There have been speculations in the market that Nvidia is faced with production snags that can delay the product\u2019s delivery schedule.\nWith the stock up more than +150% this year alone, most investors will assume that valuation must be really stretched already. The actual ground reality is not that simple.\nNvidia shares are currently trading at 40.2X forward 12-month EPS estimates. This is almost double the comparable multiple for the S&P 500 index of 21.5X. Over the last five years, Nvidia shares have traded as high as 106.3X forward 12-month estimates, as low as 26.8X, and have a 5-year median of 50.7X.\nAnother way to look at Nvidia's valuation is to look at the magnitude of the premium the stock is currently enjoying relative to where that premium or discount has historically been.\nNvidia\u2019s current forward 12-month P/E multiple is 187% of the S&P 500 multiple. Over the last five years, the stock\u2019s multiple has been as high as 569% and as low as 134%, with a median over this period of 248%.\nIn other words, the stock isn\u2019t cheap, but it has traded at higher multiples over its history. Prediction is very difficult, particularly if it\u2019s about the future, as someone wise once opined. Predictions for Nvidia shares require how sustainable the company\u2019s competitive advantages are in the coming AI revolution, not to mention whether the ongoing all-around AI optimism has a solid foundation.\nNvidia aside, the earnings focus lately has been on the Retail sector. To that end, we will be getting results this week from Lululemon, Best Buy, Dollar General, and a few other retailers.\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q2 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 30 of the 36 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Please note that these 30 retailers account for 97.3% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index.\nRegular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification.\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players.\nTotal Q2 earnings for these 30 retailers that have reported are up +17.3% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues, with 63.3% beating EPS estimates and only 46.7% beating revenue estimates.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, the Retail sector companies have struggled with beating EPS and revenue estimates in Q2. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentages for these players is the low over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years), and the EPS beats percentage isn\u2019t that far from the low-point either.\nWith respect to the elevated earnings rate at this stage, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 26 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q2 earnings were up +99.8% on +10.1% higher revenues, as it beat on EPS but missed top-line expectations.\nAs we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor.\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q2 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon\u2019s results (left side chart) and without Amazon\u2019s numbers (right side chart).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower-end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week\u2019s Earnings Reports\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, August 23rd, we have seen Q2 results from 478 S&P 500 members, or 95.6% of the index\u2019s membership. Total earnings for these index members are up +8% from the same period last year on +5.1% higher revenues, with 79.9% beating EPS estimates and only 60.3% able to beat revenue estimates.\nAs noted earlier, we have over 140 companies on deck to report Q2 results this week, including 15 S&P 500 members. The notable companies on deck to report results this week, besides the aforementioned Nvidia, include Salesforce, Lululemon, Best Buy, Dollar General, and others.\nThe comparisons charts below put the earnings and revenue beats percentages for these companies in a historical context.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 60.3% is a new low for this group of index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\nRevenue beats have been low from the start of the reporting cycle, a trend that will carry through to the end of the earnings season.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies in a historical context.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Earnings Big Picture \nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the few still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.6% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues.\nThis is the highest earnings growth pace in the last eight quarters since the +10% in 2022 Q1. The Q2 aggregate earnings total is on track to be a new all-time quarterly record, as the chart below shows.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the year-over-year earnings and revenue growth for 2024 Q2 in the context of what we saw in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the following three periods.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +3.9% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues.\nPlease note that estimates for Q3 have been steadily coming down, with the current +3.9% earnings growth rate down from +6.9% in early July, as the chart below shows.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis is a bigger cut to estimates relative to what we saw in the comparable periods for the preceding two quarters. The negative revisions trend is broad-based, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut since the quarter began. The biggest cuts have been to the Transportation, Business Services, Energy, Aerospace, and Basic Materials sectors. On the positive side, estimates for the Tech sector are increasing, while the same for the Finance sector are only marginally higher relative to where we started in early July.\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8% on +1.8% revenue growth. Excluding the Energy sector drag, whose earnings are now expected to be down -11.8% in 2024, total earnings for the rest of the index would be up +9.6%.\nThe expected 2024 revenue growth pace improves to +4.2% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index-level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +7.5% on an ex-Finance basis.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nUnlike the calendar year view that the above chart shows, the chart below the earnings data on a rolling four-quarter basis\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Breaking Down Retail Earnings: Good or Bad? \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's hard to overstate the degree to which artificial intelligence (AI) has altered the technology landscape since early last year, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the ranks of the world's most valuable businesses.\nWhile the No. 1 position has changed hands several times over the past 12 months, it's currently occupied by Apple. The company's recent AI announcements have energized the Apple faithful, driving its market cap to $3.4 trillion.\nWith its full-court press into AI, Microsoft takes up the No. 2 spot at $3.1 trillion. Nvidia, with its industry-leading AI chip, has doubled over the past year to earn the No. 3 spot at $2.9 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- each with solid AI game plans of their own -- are also members of this exclusive fraternity, with market caps of $2.1 trillion, $1.9 trillion, and $1.2 trillion, respectively (as of market close on Wednesday).\nWith a market cap of just $41 billion, it might seem like an exaggeration to suggest that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, might have a shot at joining the $1 trillion club. However, the strong, accelerating demand for servers designed to harness the power of AI -- and the company's years of experience in the field -- suggest Supermicro might have the qualities needed for membership.\nWhile Supermicro has only recently caught the attention of AI-centric investors, the company has been serving up custom-designed servers for more than three decades. This track record of experience served Supermicro well when those wanting to harness the power of generative AI came calling.\nThe company's claim to fame is its track record of developing power-miserly, rack-scale servers that boast a lower cost of ownership. Yet these cost-efficient systems are still able to provide the computational horsepower necessary to harness the power of AI and hyperscale data centers.\nFurthermore, Supermicro's building-block architecture ensures it can create a system to accommodate any budget or technology level. Finally, partnerships with the most important names in AI chips, including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others, ensure a steady supply of the most in-demand processors.\nThis successful strategy has helped generate meteoric growth. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), revenue surged 200% year over year to $3.8 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $6.56 soared 329%. Management is forecasting its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year revenue guidance to $14.9 billion, which would represent growth of 109%.\nManagement said Supermicro grew 5 times faster than the industry average over the preceding 12 months, suggesting the company is gaining market share. Analysts at Northland came to the same conclusion, noting the company has increased its market share from 8% to 11%, with \"plenty of room for future share gains.\"\nFinally, in a nod to Supermicro's importance within the broader market, the stock was added to the Nasdaq-100 Index on July 22.\nSupermicro has the inside track when compared to its rivals. When demand for AI servers ratcheted up last year, the company was nimble enough to adjust on the fly. Its strong relationships with all the top AI chipmakers gave Supermicro a steady supply of the processors needed to outfit its high-end servers. That said, it will be some time before Supermicro achieves the title of trillionaire.\nAccording to Wall Street, Supermicro is on track to deliver revenue of $14.9 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 2.75. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $363 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. Still, those days are a long way off, as Supermicro is scrambling to increase its production capacity to support sales of $25 billion.\nIf the company can keep up its triple-digit year-over-year growth, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap as soon as 2029. However, even the bulls concede that maintaining growth of that magnitude is unlikely to happen. What's more likely is that the growth rate tapers off to a more manageable 50%, in which case Supermicro could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2032.\nSome on Wall Street believe the demand for AI-capable servers will continue for years. Bank of America analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya calculates the market will increase at a compound annual growth rate of 50% over the next three years, maintaining that Supermicro's revenue could \"grow even faster.\"\nThis helps underscore the massive opportunity. If Supermicro captures just a small part of that windfall, the company will be a member of the $1 trillion club in short order.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Keith Noonan ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been 2024's most influential stock. Rising artificial intelligence (AI) demand spurred enormous sales and earnings growth for the company, and the business momentum translated to incredible valuation gains.\nThe processing leader's share price is up 161% across this year's trading alone, and its incredible performance has been a bullish catalyst for the market at large and other individual players in the AI space. Now, Nvidia stock is on the verge of its next big test.\nAfter the market closes on Wednesday, Aug. 28, the company will publish results for the second quarter of its 2025 fiscal year (which ended July 28). Management will also host a conference call to give investors further insight into the business and its outlook.\nThe earnings release will likely be one of this year's most important stock market events, and anticipation on Wall Street is running high. There's plenty of speculation on whether Nvidia will beat earnings expectations, and I'm predicting that the AI giant will comfortably beat most targets. But buckle up, because this one could get wild.\nIn its fiscal 2025 first quarter update, Nvidia management guided for roughly $28 billion in sales in the second quarter. If the company hits that target, it would mean delivering annual sales growth of 107%. Management also expects Nvidia's gross margin to grow to 74.8%. Those numbers are nothing to sneeze at.\nWall Street is even more optimistic, with the average analyst estimate calling for the AI frontrunner to deliver sales of $28.6 billion in the period. Thus far, the company has been building an impressive streak of performance beats. Take a look at the table below, which tracks Nvidia's revenue against Wall Street's expectations over the company's last four reported quarters.\nFiscal Quarter\nWall Street Consensus Revenue Target\nActual Revenue\nPercentage Beat\nQ2 2024\n$11.22 billion\n$13.51 billion\n20.4%\nQ3 2024\n$16.18 billion\n$18.12 billion\n12%\nQ4 2024\n$20.62 billion\n$22.1 billion\n7.2%\nQ1 2025\n$24.65 billion\n$26.04 billion\n5.6%\nData sources: Nvidia and CNBC.\nWith the company posting fantastic margins, sales beats have also meant that the company's earnings have crushed Wall Street's expectations. Across the last year, the company's quarterly non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings beat the midpoint Wall Street target by an average of 17.3%.\nThere's a very good chance that Nvidia will manage to beat its own targets and the average Wall Street estimates with its upcoming quarterly report. Here's why.\nWith its last quarterly report, Microsoft announced capital expenditures (capex) of $19 billion \u2014 with nearly all of the spending going to improving the company's cloud and AI infrastructure. Capex was up 35% from the previous quarter, and management also announced that spending is poised to continue climbing over the next year. Microsoft is widely believed to be Nvidia's largest customer, and increased spending on AI infrastructure is a clear bullish indicator.\nThe software giant wasn't the only one to deliver encouraging capex news recently. Meta Platforms, another big Nvidia customer, also raised its capital-spending guidance range with the second-quarter results it published at the end of last month.\nIn general, the sentiment among many leading tech companies appears to be that it's better to invest heavily in artificial intelligence right now than to risk being left behind or playing catch-up with competitors. Along with promising capex data from technology giants, that bodes well for Nvidia \u2014 and I think the company will beat top- and bottom-line expectations in Q2.\nBut there's a catch.\nWhile the average Wall Street target calls for Nvidia to report revenue of $28.6 billion for the second quarter, some analysts have set the target significantly higher. For example, HSBC expects the business to report $30 billion in revenue for the period.\nBeating the average Wall Street target is often enough to trigger bullish valuation momentum for a company, but that isn't always the case. Hot stocks in particular are often held to higher standards \u2014 with investors looking for the business to deliver results that match or exceed elevated expectations. It's also worth noting that Wall Street analysts have gotten more accurate in modeling the company's performance over the last year of reporting, with Nvidia's quarterly sales beat going from 20.4% in last year's second quarter to 5.6% in this year's first quarter.\nEven if Nvidia manages to far exceed the average Wall Street targets, there are other catalysts that could lead to volatile trading after earnings. Investors will also have the company's guidance for the current quarter and future roadmap under the microscope, and reports have emerged that the AI leader may be delaying the release of its next-generation Blackwell processors. Depending on what Blackwell news Nvidia has to share, the stock could see big moves in either direction.\nSo even with signs that the AI luminary will deliver strong Q2 results, investors should understand the stage could be set for post-earnings valuation volatility. Rather than trying to time short-term buying and selling moves around what the company's share price will do soon after earnings, it makes more sense to approach an investment in Nvidia with the company's long-term outlook in mind. Things generally continue to look quite promising on that front.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best-performing stocks over the past couple of years, literally adding trillions of dollars in value to its shareholder's portfolios. Several big hedge fund managers were among those investors who made a lot of money by investing early in Nvidia. But now they're starting to take their chips off the table and place bets in a couple of other incredible artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\nSome hedge fund managers selling investments in Nvidia include:\nStanley Druckenmiller: sold 71% (441,551) of his family office's shares and 100% (4,895) of his call options on Nvidia.\nIsrael Englander: sold 35% (720,004) of Millennium Management's shares and 31% (6,910) of its call options. He maintains a heavy position in Nvidia put options, which give him the right to sell the stock at a certain price.\nChris Rokos: sold 41% (105,453) of his hedge fund's shares.\nPhilippe Laffont: sold 68% (2,937,060) of Coatue Management's shares.\nThere are many more examples of big sales from institutional investors. After the meteoric rise of Nvidia's share price, it makes sense for them to at least reduce their stake. However, average investors should be more interested in what big hedge fund managers are buying now.\nHere are two superb AI stocks billionaires are buying as they sell Nvidia.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) vaulted to the forefront of the AI space when it added $10 billion to its investment in generative AI leader OpenAI in early 2023. Despite its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world before the AI boom, artificial intelligence is proving to be a substantial growth area for the technology company.\nSeveral billionaire fund managers saw an opportunity to buy more shares of Microsoft in the first quarter, including:\nOle Andreas Halvorsen: bought 1,596,887 shares, reestablishing a position in the stock for his Viking Global Investors fund.\nSteven Cohen: bought 566,749 shares, more than doubling Point72's stake in the stock. He also disposed of options positions, including 1,844 put options.\nChris Rokos: bought 274,232 shares, increasing his hedge fund's stake by 172% from the fourth quarter.\nMicrosoft's core AI product is Azure AI, which provides cloud solutions for AI developers looking to use existing foundation models to deploy new AI-powered software solutions. The company grew its Azure AI customers by 60% year over year last quarter, and the average expenditure per customer is growing, too.\nMicrosoft is investing heavily in building out its data center capacity. But management said it will take some time for all of it to come online. As a result, it expects an acceleration in Azure revenue in the second half of fiscal 2025. That's quite a feat, considering it's already the fastest-growing hyperscale cloud provider today.\nMicrosoft also offers its own AI assistants across its enterprise software portfolio, which is called Copilot. Adoption is growing quickly, with customers increasing 60% quarter over quarter. With over 400 million Office 365 commercial seats, there's a long runway for growth for the product.\nThe stock currently trades around 30 times forward earnings estimates. While that's a significant premium to the S&P 500, the stock seems well worth the price. It's leadership in enterprise software solutions and AI development should provide years of outsized growth.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has long been at the forefront of AI development. Machine learning algorithms form the backbone of the content feeds on Facebook and Instagram, along with the up-and-coming Threads, which recently passed 200 million monthly active users.\nRecently, it's turned its attention to generative AI, developing and open-sourcing the Llama family of foundation models, which are behind its Meta AI feature in Instagram and Facebook as well as many other behind-the-scenes features. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has the ambition to turn Meta into \"the leading AI company in the world.\"\nBillionaires are buying into Zuckerberg's vision and putting their money into the stock. Some high-profile purchases in the first quarter include:\nChris Rokos: bought 377,551 shares, reestablishing a position for his hedge fund for the first time since 2022.\nRay Dalio: added 327,992 shares of the stock, increasing Bridgewater Associates' stake by 49%.\nStanley Druckenmiller: bought 63,930 shares, reestablishing a position.\nWhile Meta already uses AI across its family of apps for content recommendations, it's starting to integrate it into its advertising services. Zuckerberg said he sees a day when \"advertisers will basically just be able to tell us a business's objective and a budget, and we're going to do the rest for them,\" during Meta's second-quarter earnings call. He also sees Meta facilitating the creation of AI service agents for business, which opens the door for more business messaging monetization opportunities.\nPut it all together, and AI will have a considerable impact on Meta's continued revenue growth. Increased engagement combined with lower hurdles to creating and targeting advertisements and improving the algorithms needed to target those advertisements as accurately as possible should all result in strong revenue and profit growth for the social media company. Meanwhile, its hardware business, including its Oculus VR headsets and Ray-Ban sunglasses, is showing strong growth bolstered by its AI features.\nMeta shares currently trade around 23 times forward earnings estimates, which is considerably lower than most AI stocks. That's despite the fact that Meta's bottom line continues to grow at a steady rate in the mid to high double digits, giving it a very attractive PEG ratio. Its continued investments in AI should ultimately produce strong returns for the company and its shareholders.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Specifically, they highlight AMBA, AIP, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), CEVA, PWR, and PDFS as attractive picks heading into Nvidia's earnings report.\nThese companies are seen to be poised to benefit from various trends in the semiconductor and AI markets.\nThe report also underscores the competitive dynamics in the AI sector, particularly between Nvidia and AMD.\n\"AMD and NVDA are on different commercialization paths,\" Northland notes, drawing a parallel to the historical rivalry between Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). They expect Nvidia's market share in AI infrastructure to erode over time as alternatives gain traction.\nWhile Nvidia's earnings could introduce volatility, Northland Capital Markets sees potential in these six semiconductor stocks, making them attractive buys ahead of the report.\nRelated Articles\nBuy these six semis stocks going into Nvidia earnings\nWill Buffett's 'put' on oil firm Occidental halt share drop?\nTJ Maxx parent raises annual profit forecast after strong second quarter\n"

        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Since the start of 2023, shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) have surged 785% higher. The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has lifted this business to new heights, and investors couldn't be more excited about its prospects.\nHowever, one e-commerce stock has skyrocketed more than the AI infrastructure enterprise. Shares of the booming online car retailer Carvana (NYSE: CVNA)\u00a0are up 3,270% since the beginning of 2023, which would've turned $1,000 into almost $34,000 today.\nYou might be thinking that it's time to ride the momentum to huge returns. But is it too late to buy Carvana stock?\nTo say that Carvana was a struggling enterprise might be putting it lightly. In fact, the company was quite literally on the verge of bankruptcy, which was spurred by Carvana's acquisition of the ADESA auction platform. The leadership team restructured its debt a year ago, lowering interest payments\u00a0and extending maturities.\nCleaning up the balance sheet, or management's actions that at least gave the company some breathing room, worked wonders to boost investor sentiment toward the stock. Near-term uncertainty was drastically reduced.\nCarvana also deserves credit for improving its fundamentals. In 2022, the business reported a 3%\u00a0volume decline, and the net loss ballooned\u00a0to $2.9 billion. Revenue and unit volume tanked\u00a0in 2023, but a relentless focus on cost cuts drastically improved the income statement.\nAlthough they're tiny figures, Carvana has posted positive earnings\u00a0in each of the first two quarters of 2024. The company is also growing again. The stock's monster performance shows that when the market has extremely low expectations, even the smallest fundamental improvements can have a beneficial impact. But Carvana isn't out of the woods just yet.\nIf we simply ignore the company's financial picture (Carvana still carries $5.6 billion in long-term debt), it's clear that Carvana is solving a big problem in the industry. Consumers generally aren't happy with the traditional car-buying process. Shoppers must haggle with a salesperson, deal with lots of paperwork, and choose from a limited inventory. Plus, it doesn't help that the entire process can take hours.\nHere's where Carvana truly shines. Consumers can buy a car and obtain financing in a matter of minutes. And there's a huge nationwide pool of cars to choose from. What's more, Carvana offers free delivery on select cars, and there's also a seven-day trial period. It's no wonder the business sold 131% more units in the latest quarter\u00a0than it did five years before in Q2 2019.\nIt's easy to be optimistic about long-term growth prospects, too. Last year, about 36 million used cars were sold in the U.S., which gives Carvana less than 1% market share based on 2023 figures. This is an extremely fragmented industry that an online-only platform could penetrate and command a bigger portion of.\nBut there's competition. There are traditional dealerships, many of which are starting to bolster their digital offerings, and Carvana must also contend with scaled car retailers like AutoNation and CarMax.\nMoreover, Carvana's ultimate success is far from certain. A lot can go wrong, like\u00a0the business running into financial troubles again or the economy entering a severe recession. In the latest quarter, 67% of operating income went toward paying\u00a0interest expenses, which\u00a0doesn't leave much wiggle room.\nAt their low point in December 2022, shares traded at a dirt cheap price-to-sales ratio of 0.025. That multiple has soared to 2.6 today. The valuation is no longer compelling, in my opinion. That argument holds more weight when you realize that Carvana remains a risky business to own.\nInvestors should think twice before buying the stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Carvana, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Carvana wasn\u2019t one of them.

It\u2019s Jensen Huang\u2019s turn to move markets,\u201d said Anthony Saglimbene at Ameriprise, referring to Nvidia\u2019s chief. \u201cIn our view, Nvidia\u2019s earnings report this week may actually have more impact on the overall market than Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole speech last week.\u201d\nIts report this week will wrap up results for the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d which combined are on track to post 34% year-over-year growth in earnings for the second quarter \u2014 compared to 6% for the rest of the S&P 500, according to Jason Pride and Michael Reynolds at Glenmede.\nThis comes after a nearly year-long period in which the cohort of megacaps posted earnings growth of more than 40% \u2014 while the rest of the index saw outright declines.\n\u201cThe back half of this year is likely to be the beginning of a process that gives way to broader fundamental improvement,\u201d they said. \u201cBroader earnings growth participation should favor small caps and investment processes that avoid the pitfalls of market concentration.\u201d\n\u201cAt current valuations, stocks are expensive and any further upside will depend on improving earnings,\u201d said Richard Saperstein at Treasury Partners. \u201cAbundant liquidity coupled with declining inflation and an accommodative central bank will provide the backdrop for higher stock prices.\u201d\nS&P 500 returns following the initial Fed rate cut tend to be positive \u2014 unless the economy falls into recession, according to Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services, who also notes that\u2019s not his base-case scenario.\n\u201cSmall caps are likely to do better in the near term \u2014 but longer term we still prefer large caps,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cSmall caps are a greater beneficiary of lower short-term rates, and valuations are cheap. However, historical trends after first Fed rate cut are mixed, earnings trends are still weak, and a cooling economy is historically a headwind for the asset class.\u201d\n\u201cGrowth stocks are losing bullish momentum right now in both outright price and relative strength to the S&P 500 while the opposite is true for value stocks which hit fresh all-time highs last week and are stabilizing relative to the S&P 500,\u201d said Tom Essaye at The Sevens Report. \u201cMore evidence is needed but a value-over-growth trade is emerging.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s hard to stand in front of a market trending higher that is about to get rate cuts, we continue to think equities will show some consolidation around the area of prior highs, said Jonathan Krinsky at BTIG.\n\u201cNo rush to push all your chips in right here, especially as we enter one of the worst seasonal stretches of the year,\u201d Krinsky noted. \u201cSmall caps remain above their key breakout level, but we are more interested in the potential turn in the relative trend. Rate cuts should help this trade, assuming the eco data holds up.\u201d\nUS inflation figures this week will reinforce that long-awaited interest-rate cuts are coming soon, while a reading on consumer spending is seen indicating that the central bank has been successful at keeping the expansion intact.\nEconomists see the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy \u2014 the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of underlying inflation \u2014 rising 0.2% in July for a second month. That would pull the three-month annualized rate of so-called core inflation down to 2.1%, a smidgen above the central bank\u2019s 2% goal.\nCorporate Highlights:\nElliott Investment Management has increased its equity stake in Southwest Airlines Co. to 9.7%, nearing the amount needed to call a special shareholder meeting at which the activist hopes to replace most of the carrier\u2019s board.\nApple Inc. has sent out invitations for a product launch event at its headquarters on Sept. 9, when it\u2019s set to announce details of the iPhone 16 and other new devices.\nLongtime Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri will step down from the job at the end of the year, handing the role to top deputy Kevan Parekh after more than a decade.\nApplied Materials Inc. said the US Department of Justice has requested information on its applications for federal grants, adding another layer to government investigations into its operations.\nParamount Global is moving ahead with asset disposals to raise cash, people familiar with the matter said, amid the ongoing takeover saga involving the media company.\nMcKesson Corp. agreed to buy a controlling stake in an arm of Florida Cancer Specialists & Research Institute, a privately held operator of clinics.\nPDD Holdings Inc.\u2019s shares tumbled after Temu\u2019s owner warned that revenue growth will inevitably dwindle, highlighting the challenges of sustaining its pace of expansion against aggressive rivals like ByteDance Ltd.\nKey events this week:\nChina industrial profits, Tuesday\nGermany GDP, Tuesday\nUS Conference Board consumer confidence, Tuesday\nNvidia earnings, Wednesday\nFed\u2019s Raphael Bostic and Christopher Waller speak, Wednesday\nEurozone consumer confidence, Thursday\nUS GDP, initial jobless claims, Thursday\nFed\u2019s Raphael Bostic speaks, Thursday\nJapan unemployment, Tokyo CPI, industrial production, retail sales, Friday\nEurozone CPI, unemployment, Friday\nUS personal income, spending, PCE; consumer sentiment, Friday\nSome of the main moves in markets:\nStocks\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.3% as of 4 p.m. New York time\nThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1%\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%\nThe MSCI World Index fell 0.3%\nBloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index fell 1.2%\nThe Russell 2000 Index was little changed\nCurrencies\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.3%\nThe euro fell 0.3% to $1.1160\nThe British pound fell 0.2% to $1.3185\nThe Japanese yen fell 0.1% to 144.58 per dollar\nCryptocurrencies\nBitcoin fell 1.4% to $63,359.76\nEther fell 3.2% to $2,681.56\nBonds\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced two basis points to 3.82%\nGermany\u2019s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 2.25%\nBritain\u2019s 10-year yield declined five basis points to 3.91%\nCommodities\nWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 3% to $77.09 a barrel\nSpot gold rose 0.2% to $2,518.29 an ounce\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n--With assistance from Robert Brand, Catherine Bosley and Jason Scott.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports\nHow Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis\nHong Kong\u2019s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City\u2019s Property Pain\nFar-Right \u2018Terrorgram\u2019 Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks\nUS Tech Is Holding Back Some AI Products From Europe\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Ken Griffin Raised His Position in This Rival AI Stock by More Than 500%",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have soared, resulting in a major boost for investors that got in on the shares early. And many billionaire investors have benefited \u2014 including Ken Griffin, chief executive of Citadel. Griffin initially bought Nvidia back in 2013, and as recently as late last year his fund held more than three million shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant.\nBut Griffin wasn't a buyer of Nvidia in recent months. In fact, in the first quarter of this year, he reduced his position in Nvidia by 68% to about 1.1 million shares. And at the same time, he increased his holding of another AI stock by more than 500%. Does this mean that, like Griffin, you should forget Nvidia and bet on this AI player? Let's find out.\nFirst, it's important to note investors have a pretty good reason for following Griffin's path. Since launching Citadel back in 1990, Griffin has built the fund to $63 billion in investment capital today. And Citadel has scored recognition as the most profitable hedge fund ever. So, when Griffin makes a particular bet on a stock, it's worth taking note \u2014 and in some instances, you may decide to follow.\nNow let's consider the billionaire's latest move. The hedge fund giant increased his position in Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) by more than 500% to about 295,000 shares, a clear sign of confidence in this AI company. Griffin has probably already started to win from this move since the stock has advanced about 35% so far this year.\nAnd the company completed a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this month, offering current holders additional shares to lower the per-share price of its stock. This doesn't change the value of Griffin's holding \u2014 or yours if you're a Broadcom shareholder \u2014 but it does offer shareholders a greater number of shares. A stock split is generally positive for a stock over time as it allows a wider range of investors to more easily buy it.\nWe don't know the exact reason why Griffin decided to increase his holding of Broadcom in the triple digits, but there's a lot of evidence showing Broadcom could be an AI winner down the road. In the most recent quarter, the semiconductor and networking giant said AI revenue surged 280% to more than $3.1 billion. Demand from mega-scale data centers for AI networking and custom accelerators is driving this growth, the company says.\nAs these data centers, or hyperscalers, continue to expand, Broadcom is seeing more and more growth in its networking business. The company doubled the number of switches it sold in the quarter year over year and now is developing next-generation switches and optics that should drive a new wave of growth.\nBroadcom is optimistic about this growth continuing, and considering forecasts for the AI market, there's reason for investors to be confident about the company's future too. Today's $200 billion AI market is set to reach more than $1 trillion later this decade. It's important to remember that right now more than 99% of Internet traffic travels through a Broadcom technology \u2014 so the company, as a leader, is well positioned to benefit from the AI boom.\nOn top of this, Broadcom also is seeing growth from its acquisition of cloud software company VMware. In fact, it predicts VMWare will help drive a 42% increase in annual revenue this year to about $51 billion.\nSo, is it time to forget Nvidia and turn to Broadcom? It's important to note that the companies could be considered rivals or peers because they are both chipmakers. But, while Nvidia is more focused on serving data centers with chips and other related products and services, Broadcom's business covers a lot more territory. The company makes thousands of products used not only in data centers but also in home connectivity, smartphones, and telecommunications in general. So, while Broadcom is growing thanks to AI, it doesn't depend on this market as much as Nvidia does \u2014 this could make Broadcom a safer bet over time.\nStill, it's also key to remember Citadel's Griffin hasn't exited his Nvidia position. He holds a considerable number of shares. So, the billionaire clearly hasn't lost faith in Nvidia and continues to believe the stock could generate solid returns.\nAll of this means there are reasons to be optimistic about both of these AI stocks. That said, one thing right now supports the idea of forgetting Nvidia and following Griffin into Broadcom, and that's valuation. Broadcom trades for 31x forward earnings estimates compared to 41x for Nvidia.\nThis is a very reasonable price considering the company's track record of growth and potential for gains from AI and the VMware acquisition. And that's why, right now you may want to forget Nvidia, and follow billionaire investor Griffin into Broadcom.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

Taiwan-listed shares of chipmaker TSMC slid 2%, Nasdaq futures dropped 0.7%, and Europe is set for a lower open, with EUROSTOXX 50 futures off 0.2%.\nNext up, Germany and Spain will publish their preliminary inflation readings for August later in the day. And a few European Central Bank officials will be taking part in some panel discussions.\nHeadline inflation is expected to slow to 2.3% for Germany and 2.5% for Spain. Any downward surprises there will feed into the eurozone inflation reading due on Friday and add to the case of consecutive policy easings from the ECB for the rest of the year.\nSwaps imply a cut in September is a done deal, but they are less sure about the chance of a move in October and December, pricing in just about 60 basis points of easing by the year end.\nThe often volatile U.S. jobless claims report, due later in the day, has also gained prominence after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell declared policymakers do not wish to see further weakening in the labour market.\nElsewhere, currency markets were mostly steady in the Asia session. The kiwi dollar rose 0.6% to a fresh 2024 high of $0.6281 after a local survey showed a huge turnaround in business activity fuelled by a rate cut from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.\nU.S. Treasury yields were also quiet, although the inverted curve between two- and 10-years came within a whisker of turning positive. That would be the first time since July 2022, barring the brief un-inverting during the Japanese market crash earlier this month.\nTwo-year yields held at 3.8671%, just 3 basis points higher than 10-year yields.\nKey developments that could influence markets on Thursday:\n- Spain, Germany preliminary CPI for August\n- U.S. weekly jobless claims\n- Panel participation from ECB chief economist Philip R.

        "Title": "We Think NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Can Manage Its Debt With Ease",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt in April 2024, down from US$11.0b, one year before. However, it does have US$31.4b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$21.7b.\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$15.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$12.7b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$31.4b and US$12.4b worth of receivables due within a year. So it actually has US$15.9b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nThis state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the US$3.18t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Simply put, the fact that NVIDIA has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.\nEven more impressive was the fact that NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 956% over twelve months. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 82% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case NVIDIA has US$21.7b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$39b, being 82% of its EBIT. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for NVIDIA that you should be aware of before investing here.\nIf you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Nearly half of Nvidia\u2019s revenue comes from just four mystery whales each buying $3 billion\u2013plus",
        "Author": "  Christiaan Hetzner ",
        "Text": "Microchip designer Nvidia more than doubled its second-quarter revenue thanks to just a handful of whales that accounted for nearly one out of every two dollars in sales the company booked.\nFour customers, whose identities were kept anonymous for competitive reasons, directly purchased goods and services collectively worth 46% of Nvidia\u2019s $30 billion in turnover. That amounts to roughly $13.8 billion, according to the company\u2019s\u00a010-Q regulatory filing\u00a0published alongside its\u00a0hotly anticipated\u00a0quarterly investor update.\nEach was responsible for more than a tenth of overall top line, and their purchases were all related to its booming business selling chips to data centers, the likes of which entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk are in a rush to build amid the gold rush in artificial intelligence.\nTo put that into perspective, this quartet of customers contributed more in sales than Nvidia reported for the prior year\u2019s period as a whole.\nAlthough the names of the mystery AI whales are not known, they are likely to include Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, OpenAI, or Tesla.\nNvidia\u2019s hottest products are AI chips like the H200. These are needed to train large language models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. They are also used to power inference, the process that ChatGPT or Sora uses to generate answers to text-based prompts.\nThis dependency on a handful of major customers also highlights a rising concern in the market over just how sustainable this abrupt, exponential growth from just one corner of its business can be. Some investors like\u00a0Elliott Management\u00a0and Citadel have\u00a0voiced skepticism\u00a0over how long this can be maintained.\nHistory does give reason for concern. The semiconductor industry is known for its boom-and-bust cycles.\nShares in Nvidia are expected to open lower on Thursday, underperforming the broader equity market.\nIn fact Nvidia\u2019s business ties with these whales are so significant the company flags them in a section of its quarterly reports titled \u201cconcentration of revenue,\u201d which is dedicated to cluster risks.\n\u201cWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers,\u201d it stated in its 10-Q regulatory filing, \u201cand this trend may continue.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a trend that is staggeringly profitable. Nvidia pocketed $5.60 out of every $10 of revenue it made over the entire first half as net income\u2014margins most companies can only dream of.\nThat explains why profit after tax nearly quadrupled to $31.5 billion during this six-month period over the previous year. Whether revenue, and therefore earnings, can continue to grow at this blistering pace is crucial to its investment story.\nTake \u201cCustomer B\u201d cited in the filing, for example: Its direct purchases represented 11% of Nvidia\u2019s $30 billion in revenue. That means a single company contributed more in business than the group\u2019s second largest division\u2014gaming, with $2.9 billion\u2014did as a whole.\nCustomer B, however, remained below the 10% threshold for the entire first half, which suggests it significantly ramped up spending during the past quarter seemingly out of the blue. The exact same could be said about \u201cCustomer C\u201d; the numbers provided by Nvidia are identical.\nSpeaking to Bloomberg TV on Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang answered a question on where demand is coming from, beyond the handful of hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.\n\u201cWe\u2019re relatively diversified today,\u201d he\u00a0claimed, citing a range of different customer groups.\nYet his own company\u2019s numbers appear to dispute that conclusion. This time last year, for example, there were no direct customers whose business made up 10% or more of total revenue\u2014neither for the first nor the second quarter.\nNvidia didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request from\u00a0Fortune\u00a0for comment.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Anirudha Bhagat ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, a heavyweight in the semiconductor industry, has seen its stock tumble over 21% in the past month. This drop significantly outpaces the 14.1% and 7.3% declines of the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500, respectively.\nFrom reaching all-time highs in June and becoming one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, NVIDIA's stock has taken a sharp turn downward. The recent fall has put investors at a crossroads, raising the question: is it time to buy, hold or sell?\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSeveral factors have contributed to NVIDIA's recent downturn. The broader market has been jittery due to concerns over the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies and fears of a looming U.S. recession. These macroeconomic worries have certainly weighed on tech stocks, including NVIDIA.\nA significant factor specific to NVIDIA is the U.S. government's tightening restrictions on exporting advanced AI chips to China. While these measures aim to curb the military capabilities of China, they also threaten a substantial revenue stream for NVIDIA, given China's demand for cutting-edge AI technology.\nAdditionally, reports of delays in the delivery of NVIDIA's highly anticipated AI chips, codenamed Blackwell, have stirred unease. According to The Information, these delays are due to design flaws and could set back delivery by three months or more, affecting major customers like Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Such delays could push potential customers toward competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, further denting NVIDIA's near-term outlook.\nAdding to investors\u2019 concerns, NVIDIA shares have dipped below their 50-day moving average, a technical indicator often seen as a bearish signal. This movement suggests a potential continuation of the downward trend, at least in the short term.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nDespite NVIDIA's strong fundamentals, its valuation remains a point of contention. The stock's current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is significantly higher than the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry average, indicating that much of its expected growth is already factored into the stock price. This leaves little room for error and makes the stock particularly vulnerable to any negative developments or earnings misses.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nDespite near-term challenges, it's not all doom and gloom for NVIDIA. The company has been a standout performer. In the last reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, it registered a staggering 262% increase in revenues and a more than five-fold rise in non-GAAP EPS. NVIDIA's leadership in graphic processing units (GPUs) for gaming, data centers and professional visualization continues to drive its growth.\nLooking forward, NVIDIA is well-positioned to capitalize on several key trends, including artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and the burgeoning metaverse. These technologies are expected to see substantial growth, providing a strong demand base for NVIDIA\u2019s advanced chips. The company's revenue forecast for the second quarter stands at $28 billion, a significant leap from $13.51 billion in the same quarter last year.\nAnalysts remain optimistic about NVIDIA's future. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects a 93.4% year-over-year increase in revenues and a 106.9% rise in earnings for fiscal 2025. Moreover, the long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at an impressive 37.6% compared to the industry average of 18.9%. This bullish sentiment is reflected in upward revisions for the company's earnings estimates.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGiven the recent volatility and potential challenges ahead, investors might consider waiting for a more favorable entry point. While this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's long-term growth story remains compelling, issues like product delays, lofty valuations and macroeconomic headwinds suggest that now may not be the ideal time to buy aggressively. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nFor current shareholders, holding on to the stock seems prudent, as the company\u2019s fundamental strengths and growth drivers are intact. However, new investors should consider waiting for a more attractive entry point, possibly on further dips, to ensure they are not overpaying for future growth.\nIn summary, NVIDIA remains a dominant force in its key markets, but the current environment suggests a cautious stance. It\u2019s a stock worth holding, but potential buyers might find better opportunities by waiting for a lower entry price.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. IBM",
        "Author": "  Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom has launched a golden age for chip designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and its investors. Software and services veteran IBM (NYSE: IBM) also benefits from the same trend, but in a very different way.\nWhich one of these tech titans is the better AI stock in the summer of 2024? Let's take a look.\nNvidia wasn't a very exciting story before the generative AI surge. Two years ago, the company tried its best to distance itself from cryptocurrency mining and the lockdown-boosted consumer interest in video gaming gear was fading out. Nvidia was already shipping tons of AI accelerator chips behind the scenes, but to limited fanfare because nobody had seen ChatGPT yet. If anything, Nvidia's involvement in self-driving vehicle systems looked like a promising growth catalyst back then.\nOh my, how times have changed.\nIt's common knowledge that ChatGPT's artificial brain was built around Nvidia chips, and the company quickly emerged as the go-to supplier of AI accelerator hardware. One Nvidia A100, H100, or L40S accelerator card costs between $8,000 and $30,000. You need tens of thousands of these products to train a modern large language model (LLM). Those chip sales come in large, lucrative batches.\nSo Nvidia's sales soared 262% year-over-year in May's first-quarter report. Data center sales, including the aforementioned AI accelerators, accounted for 87% of these revenues. That's up from 60% in the year-ago period and 45% the year before that.\nAs a result, Nvidia's earnings and cash flows are skyrocketing. So is the stock price. Nvidia investors have enjoyed a tenfold multiplication of their stakes from the two-year lows in October 2022.\nThe stock is obviously up for good reason, but the AI enthusiasm feels a bit overheated. Whether you look at price to sales, price to earnings, or price to free cash flows, Nvidia is trading well above its long-term valuation ratio averages.\nLong story short, Nvidia looks overvalued despite its soaring financials. I'd be a buyer again if the stock took a dramatic dip, but I cashed in some of my Nvidia profits in the spring and it's no more than a \"hold\" idea right now.\nUnlike Nvidia, Big Blue isn't a hardware provider these days. I mean, its unique mainframe systems still provide some exposure to the hardware side of the tech world, but the company as a whole has refocused on software and services.\nThanks to its exclusive focus on business-class customers, the market was a bit slow to give IBM credit for its AI prospects. Enterprise-scale clients must put new software tools through the wringer of performance, security, and integration tests while also seeking budget approvals from several layers of management. It takes time, but the resulting contracts tend to be robust and long-lived.\nThat's where the company stands today. Many testing processes and approvals have run their course and IBM is starting to generate serious sales from its AI solutions under the Watson banner.\nIn July's second-quarter report, IBM reported $2 billion in generative AI orders, up from zero a year ago as the underlying watsonx service was launched in the summer of 2023. Management raised their full-year software growth guidance from mid-single-digits to high-single-digits -- an impressive boost since more than 80% of IBM's software sales are tied to multi-year contracts. And CEO Arvind Krishna expects that growth rate to climb into double-digit territory in 2025 and beyond.\nBig Blue's AI growth is more mellow than Nvidia's, but I also expect it to have more staying power. Sudden bursts of chip sales are one thing. A rising tide of long-term software contracts is another animal. I'd much rather invest in the slower burn with longer-lasting consequences.\nAnd then there's the valuation angle. Next to Nvidia's lofty multiples, IBM's valuation ratios look like a fire sale:\nI'm still holding some of my old Nvidia shares but I'm not looking to buy more any time soon. New money is much more likely to go into my IBM position instead, as that tech titan still looks undervalued.\nWall Street is slow to forgive IBM for a decade-long strategy shift, though I'd argue that it was exactly the right move at the right time. The next few years should show investors how well the new focus on software, services, cloud computing, and AI will work out in the long run. This is a great AI stock to buy now and hold for decades.\nAnd at the same time, Nvidia seems headed for a sharp price correction. Call me back when that stock has dropped at least 30% lower and preferably even more.\nWhile Nvidia's rapid growth is impressive, its valuation is too high. Meanwhile, IBM offers a more stable growth story as its radical strategy shift starts to pay dividends, making it an attractive option for new investments.\nYou heard it here first.\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Navellier & Associates.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks approved by Navellier & Associates.\nFounded in 1987 by growth analyst Louis Navellier, Navellier & Associates is an independent firm based in Reno, Nevada. Navellier & Associates specializes in identifying market inefficiencies to find top-growth stocks through a disciplined quantitative and fundamental analysis system. With over 30 years of experience, they offer customized portfolio strategies for individual investors to maximize returns while managing risk. Unlike competitors who mimic indexes, Navellier aims to outperform them, resulting in low correlation with benchmarks and increased diversification.\nLouis Navellier is the Founder, Chairman of the Board, Chief Investment Officer, and Chief Compliance Officer of Navellier & Associates, Inc. With decades of experience applying academic techniques to real market scenarios, he advocates for disciplined quantitative analysis to identify stocks that can outperform the market. His approach involves a rigorous three-step process: quantitative analysis, fundamental analysis, and optimization of selected securities for portfolio inclusion. This approach has been used by the firm where they employ a highly disciplined, bottom-up stock-selection process for most portfolios. First, they screen market and stock statistics to measure reward (alpha) and risk (standard deviation), selecting stocks in the top percentiles. Next, they further screen the top-ranked stocks for high-profit margins, strong earnings growth, and reasonable price/earnings ratios based on future earnings. Finally, a proprietary optimization model maximizes portfolio alpha while minimizing standard deviation, creating well-diversified portfolios across various sectors and industries.\nSince 1980, he has shared his insights through the MPT Review, a stock advisory newsletter. Since 1987, he has actively managed individual portfolios, mutual funds, and institutional portfolios.

        "Text": "Despite a recent dip, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been on a tear with a gain of more than 600% since the start of 2023. Its market capitalization soared from $360 billion to $2.5 trillion over that period, the fastest pace of value creation in stock market history.\nBut is it justified? Some analysts on Wall Street think Nvidia stock is overvalued, and they might be right in the short term based on its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its earnings per share (EPS), and it's one of the most widely-used valuation metrics among investors.\nThe Nasdaq-100 index, which includes Nvidia and all of its big-tech peers, trades at a P/E ratio of 30.7. Nvidia stock trades at a P/E ratio of around 58 based on its trailing-12-month EPS of $1.80, making it nearly twice as expensive as the index.\nBased on those numbers alone, Nvidia stock is unquestionably expensive. However, the company is growing so quickly the situation completely changes if you look just one year into the future. Wall Street estimates Nvidia will generate $3.74 in EPS in its fiscal 2026 (which will begin Jan. 30, 2025), which means its stock is even cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 on a forward-looking basis:\nNvidia's data center chips are critical to the development of artificial intelligence (AI), and while competition is gradually emerging, the company has built a significant technological lead.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to be one of the most demanded stocks in the tech sector, with Itau BBA analysts offering a detailed assessment of its prospects and a fair price range for the semiconductor company's shares.\nThe analysts recently reviewed several factors impacting Nvidia, including delays in the Blackwell chip and potential concerns around capital expenditure (capex) overbuild by major tech companies.\nDespite these challenges, Itau BBA expresses increasing confidence in Nvidia's earnings performance for the next two to three quarters.\nThey believe that the Blackwell delay, contrary to popular opinion, may actually serve as a tailwind for short-term numbers, particularly with the H200 chip proving more accretive than the B100 or B200 models.\nHowever, the analysts also highlight potential risks to Nvidia's implied growth in calendar year 2026 (CY26). \"To command a 30x P/E CY25, we believe that NVDA should have a CY26 EPS growth of at least 20%,\" writes Itau BBA.\nA capex exercise based on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s spending suggests that if Nvidia continues to grow at these levels, Microsoft\u2019s capex could reach 100% of its cash flow from operations or EBIT by FY26, raising concerns about sustainability.\nTo alleviate these concerns, the analysts point to the importance of faster AI adoption. They cite Microsoft's bullish tone in a recent earnings call, where a mass rollout of M365 Copilot was highlighted as a potential driver for increased AI infrastructure investment, which could benefit Nvidia.\n\"All-in, we continue to see NVDA delivering a USD5-6 EPS in CY25. However, we believe that we could see a semi infrastructure digestion at some point in CY26, adds the firm.\nItau BBA currently maintains its Outperform rating on the stock, explaining that its EPS projection could result in a fair price range of $150 to $180 a share for NVDA (based on a 30x P/E ratio).\nRelated Articles\nThis is a fair price range for Nvidia stock according to these analysts\nNestle replaces CEO Schneider with company veteran Freixe\nWhat's behind Microsoft's annual segment changes?\n"

        "Title": "Move Over, Nvidia and Broadcom: Wall Street's Next Stock-Split Stock -- a 120,000% Gainer Since Its IPO -- Is Ready to Take Center Stage",
        "Author": "  Sean Williams ",
        "Text": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been the talk of Wall Street since 2023 began, the return of stock-split euphoria has given AI a run for its money in 2024.\nA stock split is a mechanism publicly traded companies can lean on to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count. Its superficial in the sense that adjusting share price and share count by the same magnitude has no impact on market cap or a company's underlying operating performance.\nSplits come in two forms, with one being substantially more popular than the other. Reverse-stock splits are geared toward increasing a company's share price. This is usually done to ensure it meets the continued minimum listing standards of a major stock exchange.\nOn the other hand, forward-stock splits reduce a company's share price. The purpose of a forward split is to make shares more nominally affordable for investors who lack access to fractional-share purchases through their broker. Since forward splits are almost always announced from a position of operating strength, this is the type of split investors gravitate to.\nSince 2024 began, 13 time-tested businesses have announced or completed a stock split \u2014 all but one of which is of the forward-split variety. While no splits have garnered more attention than AI darlings Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), there's another scorching-hot stock-split stock readying for its moment in the spotlight.\nAccording to the analysts at PwC, artificial intelligence is forecast to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 through various consumption-side benefits and productivity improvements. With an addressable market this large, it's not surprising to see Wall Street fall head over heels for AI stocks.\nNvidia has been the runaway face of the AI revolution. Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's market cap has increased by $2.8 trillion, which is the fastest ascent we've ever witnessed from a market-leading business. This was the catalyst that compelled Nvidia's board to approve a 10-for-1 forward split.\nNvidia's astronomical gains are a function of its H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) being the undisputed top choice in AI-accelerated data centers. The analysts at semiconductor firm TechInsights note that Nvidia's GPUs accounted for all but 90,000 of the 3.85 million GPUs shipped in 2023 to data centers.\nWith overwhelming demand comes the exceptional pricing power that's sent the company's adjusted gross margin considerably higher. Nvidia's H100 sports a price tag ranging from $30,000 to $40,000, which is well above what its competitors are charging for their AI-GPUs.\nDon't overlook Nvidia's CUDA platform, either. This software kit that helps developers build large language models is working hand-in-hand with the company's hardware to keep customers within its ecosystem of products and services.\nMeanwhile, Broadcom has been a key supplier of networking solutions. Last year, it introduced its Jericho3-AI fabric, which can connect up to 32,000 GPUs in high-compute data centers. The goal of Broadcom's solutions is to reduce tail latency and maximize the computing potential of GPUs in use.\nAlthough Broadcom's stock has moved up in a big way because of its AI networking solutions \u2014 this sizable move led to its first-ever stock split, 10-for-1, following the close of trading on July 12 \u2014 there's a lot more to this company than just solutions tied to artificial intelligence.\nFor example, Broadcom is a leader in developing wireless chips and solutions for next-generation smartphones. Telecom companies upgrading their wireless networks to support 5G download speeds have increased demand for the chips and accessories used in next-gen wireless devices.\nWhile Nvidia and Broadcom have had their moment in the sun, another perennial outperformer, which has nothing to do with AI and has gained more than 120,000%, including dividends paid, since its initial public offering (IPO), is ready to step forward and become Wall Street's newest stock-split stock.\nFollowing the close of trading on September 11, corporate uniform and business services provider Cintas (NASDAQ: CTAS) will complete a 4-for-1 forward split and join the ranks of an elite group of outperforming stock-split stocks in 2024.\nThis marks the sixth time Cintas will have conducted a forward split since its IPO in August 1983:\nApril 1987: 2-for-1\nApril 1991: 3-for-2\nApril 1992: 2-for-1\nNovember 1997: 2-for-1\nMarch 2000: 3-for-2\nSeptember 2024: 4-for-1\nHow does a company that supplies corporate uniforms, floor mats, towels, and safety kits outperform Wall Street's benchmark indexes so decisively over a four-decade stretch? History and revenue diversity are the first important puzzle pieces.\nBased on the company's own admission in June, it has \"more than 1 million businesses of all types and sizes\" that it services. With no single customer accounting for an outsized percentage of sales, Cintas doesn't have to worry about its proverbial ship sinking because of the struggles of one or more of its customers.\nAdditionally, Cintas has history on its side. Although recessions are a perfectly normal aspect of the economic cycle, they're almost always short-lived. Periods of economic growth stick around significantly longer, thusly allowing Cintas's customers to expand. In turn, this increases demand for corporate uniforms and business services over time.\nAnother key to the company's long-term success has been its willingness to grow via acquisition. Since this century began, it's scooped up Omni Services (2002), Zee Medical (2015), and G&K Services (2017), to name a few. These earnings-accretive deals expand the company's product portfolio and work to keep existing clients within its network of products and services.\nDon't overlook innovation, either. Cintas has introduced new products to lure in new clients, and leaned on a variety of cross-selling solutions to encourage existing clients to spend more.\nThe cherry on top is the company's incredible capital-return program. It's raised its dividend every year since going public in 1983 and recently added to its share repurchase program, which stood at $1.5 billion, as of July 23, 2024. A company that can raise its payout for four decades without interruption is a business that's demonstrated it can navigate anything the U.S. economy throws its way.\nThe one downside with Cintas is its valuation. Though being an industry leader has its perks and comes with some degree of a valuation premium, a forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 43 for a company expected to grow its earnings per share by an annual average of 13% through 2028 is difficult to justify.\nBefore you buy stock in Cintas, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cintas wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Hottest 10 Stock Picks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Jim Cramer's other stock picks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer talked about what he sees as Wall Street's biggest oversights this earnings season, especially on a day when the Dow dropped 141 points, and the NASDAQ advanced 0.2%. Cramer highlighted the misleading narratives surrounding the impact of GLP-1 drugs on food and beverage companies, the reluctance to lower prices post-pandemic, the skepticism around AI investments, and the persistent belief that\nIntel remains dominant in the tech sector.\nCramer argues that if companies were more honest about their changing situations, they would gain credibility and potentially boost their stock prices. Instead, by withholding important details, they leave investors confused and more likely to make poor decisions.\n\"If companies just own up to their own changing circumstances, things would be so much easier for everybody. But who wants to admit mistakes? They earn a lot of credibility for themselves leading the higher stock prices down the line, instead their stocks languish as investors try to assess what's really going on and they presume the worst not the best.\" said Cramer.\nIn a time filled with so much misinformation, Cramer emphasized how easy it is to be misled and underscored the need to recognize these gaps. According to Cramer, despite approximately 20 million Americans reportedly using GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs, food and beverage companies refuse to acknowledge any negative impact of these medications. They won\u2019t even suggest it. Cramer argues that their denial of the effects of GLP-1 drugs is simply untrue.\n\"We know that people eat much less when they take these GLP-1s and consume less snack food because it tamps down on cravings. ...These drugs are incredibly powerful. The idea they aren't doing damage to the snack food companies is insane.\"\nCramer commented on the rising prices, stating that most companies see no need to lower them, despite significant hikes during the pandemic. He pointed out that airlines, which have consistently underperformed, refuse to reduce fares, behaving as if the price hikes never happened.\n\"In the airlines, there are endless underperformers, they simply wouldn't roll back prices, they act as if they didn't even take them up in the first place.\"\nThe same goes for hotels and entertainment venues, which sharply increased prices during the pandemic and now resist lowering them, even as demand forecasts decline. Cramer also noted that many restaurants either claim their price hikes haven't hurt sales or refuse to acknowledge the need to roll back prices.\n\"They raised prices drastically during the pandemic. They won't cap the raising prices too much even as the forecast is coming down hard.\"\nDiscussing AI, Cramer strongly disagrees with Wall Street's claim that AI investments are a waste of money. He points out that many believe big companies spending heavily on AI-related video chips aren't seeing any significant returns, and are only investing to keep up with competitors (see 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\n\"We're constantly being told that none of the big companies spending a fortune in video chips for AI has seen any meaningful return on that investment. They're only doing it to prevent their competitors from getting an edge. That's what we keep on hearing. That's absurd!\"\nCramer also challenged the common belief that INTC remains a leader in its sector. He dismissed claims that the company is poised for a major comeback, particularly in data centers, and that it has a chip capable of rivaling its competitors' dominance. He pointed out that the company's financial health tells a different story, citing the company's decision to cut its dividend last year and suspend the remainder this year. According to Cramer, these actions don't signal dominance, and he warned that this is not the same semiconductor company it once was, despite what the company might claim.\n\"I keep hearing that Intel's gonna make a huge comeback that is catching up the others in the data center. That the data center has an Nvidia killer in GE-3. That it's using the chips to sack money from you and further it's dominance. Dream on! Have you seen Intel's balance sheet? Can you read one? Do you think a company that cut its dividend last year and then suspends what was left of it this year in order to assert its dominance?! Look, this is not the Intel of old even though we want it to be. Despite Intel's protestations, I wouldn't want to be Intel's partner.\"\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors:186\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands to gain substantially from the surging demand for AI, particularly as more companies and researchers invest in AI development. The continuous growth in AI training within data centers is the main force driving NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s revenue.\nAlthough AI technology is expected to advance significantly over the next decade, the current demand already signals a strong outlook for NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s business. UBS analysts anticipate a 27% increase in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) from its current $118 price, which would raise its forward price-to-earnings ratio to 54, indicating strong confidence in Nvidia's future growth.\nJim Cramer emphasizes that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s CEO, Jensen Huang, has been confidently stating that purchasing Nvidia chips could potentially quadruple returns. He stresses that this isn't a mere speculation but a reality, and questions how much anyone has actually gained by betting against Huang's predictions over the years.\n\"Nvidia's Jensen Huang has been telling you can get 4x your money if you buy his chips. That's 4x return. I think Meta could end up getting that. The others, they actually have to spend to play catchup. It's not mythical, it's reality. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?\"\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock may still be down from its June highs by about 20%, but it's gained meaningful ground in the last week. Monday's jump of as much as 6% brings its one-week return to about 10%.\nThe stock's decline and the latest jump both come from investors watching the same thing. When word came out that production of Nvidia's newest artificial intelligence (AI) chips could be delayed, some investors feared that the high-flying advanced chip company's shares would tank. But investors are now paying attention to several Wall Street analysts who have soothed those concerns.\nToday, Bank of America's Vivek Arya released a report saying he thinks Nvidia's new Blackwell platform is \"best suited for AI\" and isn't sweating any short-term delivery delays.\nNvidia's Blackwell platform is supposed to begin shipping later this year, but a manufacturing delay could push that back several months, according to reports. But Arya noted in his report that the ongoing semiconductor \"upcycle\" is only one year into what has historically lasted more than twice that long.\nHe also believes that the adoption of AI chips is still in its early stages. That gives Nvidia a long runway to sell the Blackwell chip once deliveries begin. In the meantime, Nvidia will continue to sell its existing Hopper series chips fast through the end of this year, according to analysts at Jefferies.\nThe bottom line for Nvidia investors is that its products are in very high demand. That includes its current lineup as well as next-generation AI chips and related software. Analysts including Bank of America's Arya believe that both businesses and governments have big plans for AI adoption. That helps explain Nvidia's recent rebound and today's bounce. The next catalyst could come when the company reports its quarterly financial update on Aug. 28.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Chibuike Oguh\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Global shares edged higher on Thursday, shrugging off investor disappointment at artificial intelligence powerhouse Nvidia's results, while oil prices rebounded from two sessions of losses helped by Libyan supply disruptions.\nThe Dow reached a fresh record high close, while the S&P 500 finished just below its July record close and the Nasdaq dropped. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.59% to 41,335.05, the S&P 500 was flat at 5,591.96 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.23% to 17,516.43.\nEuropean stocks rose 0.76% after hitting a record high powered by technology shares. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.04% to 827.62.\nNvidia beat analyst estimates on Wednesday with second quarter revenue of $30 billion and third quarter revenue forecast at $32.5 billion. But the results failed to meet lofty investor expectations that have underpinned a massive rally in Nvidia shares and catapulted the company into one of the main drivers of the benchmark S&P 500. The stock closed down 6.4%.\nU.S. Commerce Department data showed that the economy grew at a 3.0% annualized rate last quarter, indicating that the Federal Reserve would have room to begin cutting rates in September.\n\"Nvidia is just a representation of what happens when the market gets ahead of itself in expectation,\" said Matthew Orton, chief markets strategist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\"When I actually look at the numbers themselves, it was a clean beat and raise pretty much across the board. I think there's a clear signal that demand for artificial intelligence remains strong.\"\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 2.4 basis points to 3.865%. Markets are fully pricing in a rate cut of at least 25 basis points (bps) during the Fed's September meeting, although expectations for a cut of 50 bps fell to 34.5% after the data, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.\nInvestors are also eyeing the personal consumption expenditure price index - which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and is due on Friday.\n\"The economy is doing a little bit better than expected. If you break down the number you see once again, it's the intrepid consumer that is continuing to consume, which is very positive for the economy,\" said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at SiebertNXT in New York.\nThe U.S. dollar rose after GDP data. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, gained 0.36% at 101.37, with the euro down 0.39% at $1.1077.\nGold climbed again and was just shy of notching another record high. Spot gold added 0.79% to $2,522.08 an ounce. U.S. gold futures settled 0.9% higher at $2,560.3.\nOil prices gained as concerns over Libyan supplies helped offset a smaller than expected draw in U.S. crude inventories, which tempered demand expectations.\nBrent crude futures settled up 1.64% at $79.94 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 1.87% at $75.91.\n(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh, Editing by Nick Zieminski and Marguerita Choy)\n"

        "Author": "  Keith Speights ",
        "Text": "Which company is the center of attention this week? It's Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), hands down. The chipmaker will announce its second-quarter earnings results following the market close on Wednesday.\nI fully expect Nvidia's numbers to delight investors again, enabling it to extend its already impressive gains this year. But there's another stock-split stock that could also soar if Nvidia delivers a blowout Q2 update.\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, is arguably joined at the hip with Nvidia. The company provides server and storage solutions that are especially popular in data centers.\nThe same artificial intelligence (AI) tailwind fueling Nvidia's growth also helps Supermicro. Charles Liang, Supermicro's president and CEO, said earlier this month that his company \"continues to experience record demand of new AI infrastructures.\" As a result, Supermicro's revenue in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2024 soared 110% year over year.\nIf Nvidia handily beats expectations with its Q2 results on Wednesday (and, more importantly, if the company's guidance is strong), it will bode well for Supermicro's fortunes over the near term. I look for Nvidia to also provide some clarity on the timing of when chips based on its new Blackwell architecture will begin shipping. This should also help Supermicro, which has liquid-cooled AI superclusters ready to support Blackwell.\nSure, Liang maintains that a delay for Blackwell won't impact Supermicro much because it does business with other chipmakers. Make no mistake about it, though: Good news from Nvidia will translate to good news for Supermicro.\nI don't think there's much doubt that a blow-out Nvidia Q2 update would provide a catalyst for Supermicro. But what about the company's 10-for-1 stock split scheduled for Oct. 1? It's iffy, in my view.\nFor one thing, Supermicro's stock split won't change anything at all about the company's underlying business or its growth prospects. On the other hand, spectacular guidance from Nvidia would likely mean stronger growth ahead for Supermicro.\nAny investor who really wanted to buy shares of Supermicro could do so even with its share price trading in the ballpark of $600. Many online brokerages support buying fractional shares.\nHowever, this will be Supermicro's first stock split. I'll admit that it's possible some investors who have remained on the sidelines could view the split as a great opportunity to buy the stock. I suspect the allure to invest in Supermicro could be even greater if the stock indeed soars as I expect it will following Nvidia's quarterly update this week.\nNow for an even more important question: Is Supermicro a better stock to buy than Nvidia? Wall Street seems to think so.\nThe consensus 12-month price target for Supermicro of analysts surveyed by LSEG in August reflects an upside potential of over 50%. By comparison, the average price target for Nvidia is slightly lower than its current price.\nI agree that Supermicro is a better pick than Nvidia. My primary reasoning is valuation. Supermicro's shares trade at a much lower forward earnings multiple than Nvidia's. But if Nvidia gives great news to investors on Wednesday, both of these stocks should be big winners.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Markets started the week with investors all around the globe running for cover. In any sell-off, some of the hardest-hit stocks are growth stocks that had run up the most. That includes advanced chip maker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nEven with the market bouncing back some this week, the high-flying stock is now down about 25% from its record closing price in mid-June. But one Wall Street analyst thinks the plunge in Nvidia shares creates a great opportunity for investors.\nOppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer just released his latest research note saying investors could gain about 50% from Nvidia stock if he's right about the stock reaching $150 per share.\nThe selling of Nvidia stock was exacerbated after rumors circulated over the weekend that a defect discovered in its next-generation Blackwell chip will cause a delay in its rollout later this year. That chip and its architecture are expected to be very popular among customers looking to get the highest computing power available for artificial intelligence (AI) plans.\nBut Oppenheimer's Schafer thinks there's no need for investor concern even if those rumors are true. That's because any delay rolling out Blackwell will be used to help supply the excessive demand for Nvidia's existing H100 AI chips.\nIn his research note, Schafer wrote, \"Nvidia's competitive position remains sound, and we don't expect any share loss from a minor delay. ... We see Nvidia as best positioned in AI, benefiting from full stack AI hardware/software solutions.\"\nSchafer's comments make complete sense. All signs point to a big gap between Nvidia's current chip capacity and surging demand. While competitors will help fill some of that gap, Nvidia should be happy to continue to sell its existing chips. Blackwell will just boost those sales even further. That makes the correction in Nvidia stock an opportunity to buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other humanoid robot stocks.\nIf there's one thing that can be said for sure, it's that 2024 is the year of technology. Artificial intelligence, despite its biggest detractors claims, has managed to persist, and in its wake, it has spurred new life into a variety of industries.\nOne such industry is robotics. Like artificial intelligence, robots have typically been thought to lie in the domain of science fiction. And like AI, they're also becoming a reality faster than we can comprehend. One of the biggest advancements in robotics has been made by the private company Boston Dynamics, whose robot dogs are used by a lot of industrial customers, including SpaceX.\nHowever, while Boston Dynamics' robot dogs are impressive, humanoid robots, or those that look like humans and perform mechanical functions like humans are further in the domain of science fiction. These robots are popularized through movies such as. the Terminator series and iRobot, are in fact, a multi trillion dollar opportunity if we're to believe research from Wall Street analysts.\nA research report by Morgan Stanley that takes one of the most optimistic takes on humanoid robots speculates that by 2030, the humanoid population will sit at a comfortable 40,000. If this was impressive, the estimates for 2040 and 2050 are not only stunning but also orders of magnitude higher. By 2040 and 2050, the humanoid population could sit at an unbelievable 8 million and 63 million, respectively - or higher than 27 out of the 50 most populous countries in the world in 2024. In terms of monetary figures, the wage impact of the 8 million population is estimated to sit at a cool $357 billion, while the impact of the 63 million robots is $3 trillion.\nThis research builds on the total addressable markets for industries that are an indispensable part of the world but suffer from low labor due to low funding and wages and dangerous, repetitive, and boring tasks. A total of 21 such industries are identified, and they are divided into three tiers. The first tier, or Tier 1, is expected to see humanoid adoption as soon as 2028. In terms of the total adoption percentage, i.e. the number of roles in these industries that could be filled by humanoid robots, the top four industries are construction and extraction, production, farming, fishing, and forestry, and building and grounds clearing maintenance.\nThe risky industries highlighted above have an adoption potential of 70%, 68%, 67%, and 67%, respectively. The highest potential of the monetary impact is also from the Tier 1 industries, and it's quite low if we're to look at the 'near term.' For the years 2030, 2032, 2034, 2036, and 2038, the wage impacts sit at $1 billion, $6 billion, $19 billion, $60 billion, and $158 billion, respectively for the Tier 1 industries. The impact for Tier 2 industries starts in 2040, with Tier 4 beginning its contribution in 2044. Yet, while their adoption might be in the future, the riskiest of use cases, i.e. space exploration, has already seen a humanoid robot in the form of NASA's Robonaut occupy the International Space Station (ISS) from 2011 to 2018. NASA's Robonaut first made its way to space in 2011, and it was upgraded to Robonaut 2 in 2014 which was brought back to Earth in 2018.\nOne industry that MS is quite optimistic about when it comes to humanoids is social care. It believes that social care \"is arguably the world\u2019s largest TAM by the end of the century, but one that suffers from restrictive funding creating a lack of incentivisation to recruit or re-skill workers. Humanoids will face many challenges. And while they may not be the best solution, they are an increasingly necessary solution for a world facing immense longevity challenges.\" Yet, the demand for these challenges could take its time to materialize. \"Understanding the humanoid theme requires a multi-sector approach and a long term time horizon\" cautions MS, but it wants investors to be ready to pounce on \" an extraordinary number of developments and milestones over the next 6 to 12 months\" even though the \"he path to commercialization at scale may take decades to fully play out.\"\nTalking numbers, there are a plethora of estimates floating around that wager a guess at the potential value of the humanoid robot industry. One estimate comes from no one else than the electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. Musk's love of everything technology has made him who he is today, and it also means that he is often at the leading edge of leading technologies,\u00a0 whether they are artificial intelligence, brain implants, or humanoid robots.\nHis most recent comments about humanoid robots came during his car company's annual shareholder meeting. At the event, the executive shared that by selling these robots, his company could become worth a whopping $25 trillion at an unspecified time in the future. Musk's robot is called Optimus, and his firm also believes that while the robot's initial bill of materials (BOM) can range between $50,000 to $60,000, these costs can be brought down to enable his company to sell $1 trillion worth of robots a year.\nMusk isn't the only one who is convinced of the potential offered by humanoid robots. Research from more Wall Street analysts estimates that the market could be worth $38 billion by 2035. Mind you, this is the Goldman analysts' base case model which estimates unit shipments of 1.4 million. The bear case, which sees shipments cut in half to 703 million suggests a value of $19 billion by 2035, while the bull case and the blue sky scenario estimate shipments of 6.5 million and 11.6 million units, respectively. Extrapolating from a $38 billion valuation that stems from 1.4 million units, this could mean that the very best scenario for the humanoid robot market leads to a value of $315 billion. At the heart of this optimism are AI and dropping BOM costs.\nAccording to the analysts, the BOM for making humanoid robots has dropped by a strong 40% between 2023 and 2024 to range between $30,000 to $150,000 depending on the specifications. This reduction is primarily \"driven by the availability of cheaper components with a broader scope of supply chain options from the mere existence in labs previously, optimization in design and manufacturing technique (e.g. cost for T-screw dropped significantly by shifting from electric discharge machining to mechanical machining.\"\nOur Methodology \nTo make our list of the best humanoid robot stocks to buy, we started with Morgan Stanley's Humanoid 66 stock list. This list is divided into three categories, humanoid enablers and beneficiaries, enablers, and beneficiaries. Since the enablers are the ones that will directly benefit in terms of tangible revenues from potential growth in the humanoid industry, we selected the top 15 stocks in the first two categories.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 186\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes and sells GPUs that are used to compute artificial intelligence workloads. These include machine learning, a key arm of AI that is used in vision processing. Vision processing is the bedrock of humanoid robots since it allows them to perceive their environment and act accordingly. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) enjoys a considerable competitive moat since its products are the industry leaders in terms of performance. It also benefits from tight software integration through its CUDA software which allows users to control GPU functions - which can be customized for humanoids. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also offers microservices and orchestration services for humanoid robots, with CEO Jensen Huang already having claimed that the \"next wave of AI is robotics.\"\nAristotle Atlantic Partners mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\"Nvidia contributed to portfolio performance in the second quarter as investors continued to view positively the new product roadmap for the rest of the year. The company sees accelerating demand for its GPU semiconductors from hyperscalers and enterprises. Nvidia\u2019s GPU semiconductors continue to be the industry-leading building blocks of the accelerated computing data center architecture to drive AI compute and applications.\"\nOverall NVDA ranks 7th on our list of the best humanoid robot stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Manali Pradhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) transformation from a gaming industry specialist to an artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouse\u00a0has been nothing short of phenomenal. Accounting for roughly 70% to 95% of the chips used in training and inferencing large language models (according to Mizuho Securities), Nvidia has emerged as the biggest beneficiary and enabler of the ongoing AI revolution.\nWhile Nvidia's stock has gained almost 140% in the past year and a dazzling 471% over the past three years, I don't think\u00a0the positive impact of this multiyear tailwind on Nvidia's share price will be exhausted in a few quarters.\u00a0There is still room for the stock to grow -- especially after it became more accessible to shareholders following its stock split.\nNvidia has surpassed consensus revenue estimates in 11 of the past 12 quarters and earnings estimates in 10 of the past 12. While that's no guarantee the company will keep surprising the market, investors awaiting the company's upcoming earnings announcement (scheduled for Aug. 28) can be confident it's taking advantage of a huge opportunity. I think Nvidia stock is still a strong buy for the following reasons.\nNvidia's data center offerings, including graphics processing units (GPUs), AI software stack, supporting frameworks, and other systems, have been in high demand in AI and high-performance computing applications. Cloud service providers, consumer internet companies, and businesses in industries as varied as finance, healthcare, and automotive are relying extensively on the company's solutions to build their AI infrastructure.\nSubsequently, the company's data center business saw explosive growth in the first quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ending April 28), with revenue soaring 427% year over year to $22.6 billion. Furthermore, with demand far outstripping supply for the company's next-generation H200 chips and Blackwell architecture chips, Nvidia expects momentum for its data center business to continue in the coming quarters.\nNvidia's rapid pace of technological innovation has made it difficult for competitors to capture market share. The company has already launched a new GPU architecture called Blackwell, which is 4 times faster in training and 30 times faster in inferencing large language models than the company's flagship H100 GPU. Blackwell architecture has been designed to be backward-compatible with software stack,\u00a0enabling customers to easily transition to advanced chips. The company has also announced plans to release successors to its H100 GPU annually, a major shift from its previous strategy of launching major chips every two years.\nNvidia has also built a robust software stack to support its AI GPU infrastructure and has partnered extensively with multiple cloud service providers. The recently launched Nvidia Inference Microservices (NIM) software also helps developers quickly build and deploy AI applications. In the face of such developments, any client who wishes to transition to competing hardware has to face high switching costs. Nvidia's commitment to innovation has further resulted in its clients opting to upgrade and expand their AI infrastructure.\nNvidia has positioned itself as a full-stack AI platform provider to capture a bigger part of the global AI infrastructure spending. Besides advanced AI GPUs, the company also offers all other essential infrastructure required by clients for AI production -- including central processing units, data processing units,\u00a0advanced networking solutions (InfiniBand, Ethernet, Spectrum-X), software ecosystem (CUDA platform, Nvidia Inference Microservices), and servers.\nNvidia is also gearing up for new data center revenue streams from the sovereign AI market. Governments across the world are striving to develop domestic AI capabilities, and Nvidia is partnering with these national and local players as a major AI infrastructure provider. On the last earnings call, the company said it expects\u00a0sovereign AI revenue to be in the \"high single-digit billions\"\u00a0 in fiscal 2025, which will end Jan. 31.\nNvidia expects automotive to be the largest enterprise vertical for its data center business and to generate multibillion-dollar revenue this fiscal year. The company has already supported Tesla in training an AI cluster comprising 35,000 H100 GPUs for autonomous driving. The company has also secured multiple design wins with several leading electric vehicle players for its Nvidia Drive Thor AI car platform.\nDespite ongoing investments in technological innovation, Nvidia has expanded its profit margins. In the first quarter, the company's non-GAAP (adjusted) gross margin jumped by 12.1 percentage points year over year to 78.9%. Net income also soared by 462% year over year to $15.24 billion. This highlights the company's robust pricing power and ability to grow revenue faster than expenses.\nNvidia returned $7.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends in the first quarter. The company split its stock on a 10-for-1 basis effective June 10, and announced a 150% increase in the quarterly dividend on a post-split basis. These moves highlight Nvidia's confidence in its future growth prospects and commitment to returning value to shareholders.\nAt recent prices, Nvidia is trading at just under 35 times trailing-12-month sales, a significant premium to its historical five-year average around 26. However, although the stock is expensive, the valuation seems justified considering the solid growth projections for the company. Analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to grow by a solid 97.5% year over year to $120.3 billion, and earnings per share (EPS) to soar by 111.4% year over year to $2.74 in fiscal 2025.\nAgainst this backdrop, investors should consider picking up at least a small stake in this stock ahead of its second-quarter earnings results.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Deborah Mary Sophia, Noel Randewich and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed ",
        "Text": "By Deborah Mary Sophia, Noel Randewich and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\n(Reuters) -Nvidia shares dropped more than 6% on Thursday after its forecast fell short of lofty expectations, though some believe the modest sell-off showed investors still remain confident in the generative AI boom that has powered the chip giant's stock higher all year.\nThe company on Wednesday forecast third-quarter gross margins that could miss market estimates and revenue that was largely in line. But some investor concerns were allayed after the company said it expects production of its next-generation Blackwell chips to ramp up in the fourth quarter.\nShares of other chip companies were mixed after some reversed gains from earlier in the session. Broadcom shares ended 0.8% lower while those of Advanced Micro Devices fell 0.6%. Shares of Arm rose 5.3%.\nNvidia\u2019s shares remain up 137% this year, making the company a pillar of the rally in U.S. stocks. Those gains have been driven in part by a series of blowout quarterly revenue forecasts, leading investors to build up ever greater expectations for its growth.\n\"They beat but this was just one of those situations where expectations were so high. I don't know that they could have had a good enough number for people to be happy,\" said JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America and president of online broker Tastytrade.\nThe forecast followed strong second-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street expectations, and the AI bellwether announced a new $50 billion share buyback as well.\n\"Investors want more, more and more when it comes to Nvidia,\" said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell.\n\"It looks like investors might not have taken the average of analyst forecasts to be the benchmark for Nvidia's performance, instead they've taken the highest end of the estimate range to be the hurdle to clear.\"\nNvidia forecast revenue of $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for its fiscal third quarter, compared with analysts' estimates of $31.8 billion, according to LSEG data. That revenue forecast implies 80% growth from the year-ago quarter, but was below the top-end of market estimates at $37.90 billion.\nBUYING OPPORTUNITY?\nSome analysts saw the dip as a buying opportunity.\n\"Nvidia has had much bigger drawdowns on (earnings) reports ... we think the sell-off is an opportunity to accumulate the stock,\" said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments.\nSome Big Tech stocks shrugged off the weakness, suggesting that investors may not see the report as a bad sign for the AI boom. Shares of Amazon.com and Apple closed higher on Thursday while Alphabet dipped 0.7%.\n\"The long-term AI story is still sort of intact. It's just a bit of a relief that the numbers weren't disastrous,\" said Ben Barringer, analyst at Quilter Cheviot.\nWorries about slow payoffs from hefty AI investments have dogged large technology companies in recent weeks, with shares of Microsoft and Alphabet trading lower since their quarterly reports last month.\nA delay in the production ramp-up of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chips until the fourth quarter was not a big concern, analysts said, with the company seeing strong demand for its current-generation Hopper chips.\nHowever, some analysts were worried about rising regulatory scrutiny after Nvidia disclosed requests for information from U.S. and South Korean regulators, adding to inquiries from the EU, UK and China previously.\n\"After the DOJ win over Google, large-cap tech has got to be more cognizant of regulatory intervention ... historically, the threat was a little bit toothless,\" Barringer said. \"But now that they've got this win over Google, investors have to pay a bit more attention.\"\nThe lackluster response to Nvidia's earnings report could help set the tone for market sentiment heading in to what is historically a volatile time of the year. The S&P 500 has fallen in September by an average of 0.8% since World War Two, the worst performance of any month, according to CFRA data.\nNvidia was valued at 36 times earnings ahead of its quarterly report, inexpensive compared with its average of 41 over the past five years. The S&P 500 is trading at 21 times expected earnings, compared with a five-year average of 18.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco, Saqib Ahmed in New York and Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Aditya Soni, Kanchana Chakravarty and Medha Singh; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Lisa Shumaker and Matthew Lewis)\n"

Morgan Stanley in its August key themes report said that while small-cap stocks rebounded on rate-cut hopes, the window for their outperformance is \u201ctoo narrow.\u201d\n\u201cHistorically small cap outperformance depended primarily on economic growth acceleration. Greater risk exposure to a \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d rate environment has added inverse rate correlation to the mix. While periods of growth acceleration with lower rates are plausible (e.g. end-2023), we see this combination as relatively unlikely in the current inflation environment. The recent decline in interest rates was a tailwind to small cap stocks, but softer economic data likely limits the durability of this trade,\u201d the firm said.\nThe latest earnings season showed that ROI on the huge AI spending by major companies is small in the short term, but long-term gains seem promising. Many companies have already started seeing monetization on their AI investments.\u00a0 Goldman Sachs analysts Joseph Briggs, Kash Rangan, and Eric Sheridan said in a June report titled\u00a0GEN AI: TOO MUCH SPEND, TOO LITTLE BENEFIT?\u00a0that they remain more optimistic about AI\u2019s economic potential even if we don\u2019t see immediate benefits for now.\nHedge funds are one step ahead of average individual investors due to the sheer scale of resources and capital they have. That\u2019s why it\u2019s always interesting to see which stocks they are buying and selling. In this article we take a look at the 10 most important AI stocks which were on the radar of elite money managers based on their second-quarter filings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nTotal Number of Hedge Fund Investors as of the End of Q2: 179\nTotal Number of Hedge Fund Investors as of the End of Q1: 186\nBillionaire Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners cut its stake in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 44% during the second quarter, while billionaire DE Shaw\u2019s fund reduced its position by 52%.

Jefferies said in a latest note that the company will smash analyst expectations for the quarter.\n\u201cWe expect another strong beat in July and strong guidance into October, with beats of about $1B for the results and guide,\u201d analysts said.\nAnalysts at Jefferies also believe the demand for Nvidia\u2019s Hopper chips is strong.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\u201cVisibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,\u201d the firm said.\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company\u2019s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won\u2019t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has \u201ctriggered a mechanical sell signal\u201d based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIf Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company.

        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were recouping losses from yesterday's rout today as investors enjoyed a \"risk-on\" movement after several volatile sessions in Nvidia and the broad market.\nToday's jump was sparked by an employment report that showed a decline in initial unemployment claims, cooling off fears that the economy was possibly headed toward a recession after the July unemployment rate jumped from 4.1% to 4.3%.\nAs a result, Nvidia stock was trading up 6.3% as of 2:17 p.m. ET, while the Nasdaq had jumped 3% at the same time.\nChip stocks, including Nvidia, rallied broadly today after initial unemployment claims fell to 233,000 last week from 250,000 the week before.\nOrdinarily, that kind of data point wouldn't move markets, but investors are closely watching employment data for signs that the economy could be weakening faster than expected.\nLast week, A spike in initial unemployment claims to the highest level in nearly a year and the disappointing July employment numbers helped trigger a sell-off that sent the Nasdaq down 8% over a three-day span. Nvidia was hit even harder, falling 14% during the collapse.\nNvidia and its semiconductor peers operate in a highly cyclical sector. In the best of times, like the last year-and-a-half, demand and prices soar, leading to billions in profit. In tougher times, the industry is plagued by inventory gluts, falling prices, and sometimes massive losses.\nThe chip sector seems to be at a tipping point right now. Investors would like some convincing that the AI boom can continue and that the U.S. economy is strong enough to support it. Big tech stocks like Microsoft and Alphabet, who are some of the biggest customers for chipmakers like Nvidia, sold off following their recent earnings reports in part due to doubts that the billions that they were spending on AI infrastructure would pay off.\nIn order for the AI boom to continue, the economy will need to avoid a recession, so it's understandable why a seemingly minor economic data point would send Nvidia and its peers soaring. Investors want reassurance on the macro environment and they just got some.\nOver the longer term, Nvidia will need strong demand for its AI components to continue, which could rely on the development of a \"killer AI app\" or more convincing that generative AI is truly transformative.\nFor now, the next big event for investors to watch is the company's second-quarter earnings results, due out on Aug. 28. The stock will almost certainly swing big on the update, and the recent sell-off in the stock could help fuel a recovery.\nUntil then, keep your eye out for more economic data, and expect more outsize reactions from the AI chip superstar.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech stocks have taken a deep dive, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector down 10% in just five days. Fears of a recession triggered a major sell-off, with seven of the most valuable tech companies losing a combined $1 trillion in market value on Aug. 5.\nAs a result, now is an excellent time to bulk up your portfolio with companies active in lucrative fields like artificial intelligence (AI). Despite the market downturn, AI remains a sector with massive growth potential. Data from Grand View Research shows the market hit $197 billion last year. Yet, that figure is expected to reach nearly $2 trillion by the end of the decade, expanding at a compound annual rate of 37%.\nIn terms of the companies powering much of the industry, it's hard to go wrong with chip stocks. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are compelling options, especially after a sell-off. Nvidia designs the chips used by the majority of AI developers. Intel is building the world's largest AI chip plant in Ohio as it seeks to retake a position as a top manufacturer.\nSo, let's take a deep dive into these chipmakers' businesses and determine whether Nvidia or Intel is the better AI stock to invest in.\nNvidia's stock has dipped 10% since July 30 as Wall Street has cooled on tech stocks. However, past trends suggest the company won't be down for long, and it could be worth buying the dip.\nThe company's stock plunged 50% amid an economic downturn in 2022, fueled by significant spikes in inflation and reduced spending across multiple markets. Yet, macroeconomic improvements and a boom in AI have seen the share price skyrocket 586% since then, alongside soaring earnings.\nNvidia's revenue, operating income, and free cash flow have hit new heights over the last year, making the recent sell-off look like an overreaction. The current economy is night-and-day different from what it was in 2022, or even 2008, for that matter. Many tech companies are growing and have posted multiple quarters of encouraging results.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia is at the top of its AI game, responsible for 80% of the AI graphics processing units (GPUs). The company got a head start in the industry over rivals like AMD and Intel, which allowed it to expand its brand power. Millions of developers have grown so accustomed to Nvidia's CUDA development software accompanying its AI GPUs that many are hesitant to switch to a rival product.\nAs a result, the company has retained its AI dominance even while its competitors have debuted similar offerings at lower prices. With solid earnings and significant market share, Nvidia is an attractive investment after a sell-off.\nIntel's stock price has plummeted 34% in the last five days, its worst drop in decades. Declines were spurred by economic fears and exaggerated by poor quarterly results.\nThe company posted its second-quarter earnings on Aug. 1. Revenue fell 1% year over year, missing forecasts by $150 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $0.02 fell short of expectations by $0.08.\nPoor earnings reflect Intel's hefty investment in restructuring, shifting to a foundry model, and placing a larger emphasis on AI. The company is focusing on the big picture and long-term rewards, suggesting investors should do the same.\nSince last year, Intel has made some major changes, unveiling multiple new AI-enabled chips and beginning construction on the first of at least four chip factories in the U.S. Neither of these ventures come cheap, as reflected in its second-quarter losses. However, they could pay off over the next five to ten years.\nCEO Pat Gelsinger said in a recent earnings call that increased production on its AI-capable Core Ultra PC chips contributed to poor earnings. But he added that \"the AI PC will grow from less than 10% of the market today to greater than 50% in 2026,\" suggesting it is likely to make up for those losses.\nThe company is taking a similar approach to manufacturing. Intel has invested billions into opening chip fabs throughout the U.S. as it seeks to become the country's leading AI chip manufacturer. It'll take time, but it could be worth buying the stock cheaply now to hold over the long term.\nNvidia and Intel are at vastly different stages of their AI journeys, with one dominating the industry and the other yet to see a return on its investments.\nConsidering their valuations, neither is a huge bargain. But Nvidia's stock is a better value, with a lower price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Meanwhile, its P/E is close to its 10-year average for the metric, while Intel's is far higher than its average.\nIntel could be a smart long-term play, but its dismal earnings and a high valuation make Nvidia a more attractive buy right now. Nvidia has an established position in AI and consistent earnings, making it too good to pass up.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is gearing up to announce second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on Aug 28, and all indications point to impressive results, thanks to huge demand for its chip from the datacenter end market. The company\u2019s dominance in the realm of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models has positioned it as a critical player, and this is likely to be reflected in its upcoming quarterly report.\nClick here to know how NVDA\u2019s overall fiscal second-quarter results are likely to be.\nNVIDIA\u2019s datacenter segment has been a powerhouse, and the trend is expected to have continued in the second quarter. The driving force behind this growth is the increasing demand for generative AI and large language models, which heavily rely on NVIDIA\u2019s cutting-edge Hopper and Ampere architecture GPUs.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, NVIDIA\u2019s datacenter revenues hit unprecedented levels, soaring 427% year over year and 23% sequentially to $22.6 billion. This surge was largely fueled by significant investments in generative AI as companies across various industries scrambled to improve their computational capabilities.\nAnalysts anticipate this momentum to have persisted in the second quarter. Per our model estimate, datacenter revenues could climb to $24.5 billion, marking an impressive 137% year-over-year growth and a 33% sequential increase. Such figures underscore the critical role NVIDIA plays in the evolving landscape of AI and datacenter technologies.\nNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\nThe rise of generative AI, particularly following the advent of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, has been nothing short of a transformation. Generative AI, supported by large language models, is revolutionizing industries by automating and enhancing content creation, from text and images to audio and synthetic data. This technological leap is modernizing workflows in sectors as diverse as marketing, customer service and healthcare.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is expected to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.6% during 2024-2032. The widespread adoption of generative AI by enterprises has underscored its value and the need for significant computational power. This is where NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation chips come into play.\nNVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are the backbone of AI models used across a variety of industries, including automotive, healthcare and manufacturing. As the demand for high-performance computing continues to rise, NVIDIA is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The company\u2019s advanced chips, known for their unparalleled computing power, are indispensable for enterprises looking to upgrade their infrastructure to meet the demands of AI.\nGiven the surging demand for AI-driven technologies, NVIDIA is expected to report strong revenue growth in its upcoming earnings release. The company expects second-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $28 billion, largely driven by the increasing investments in AI within the datacenter market.\nThis anticipated growth reflects not only the strength of NVIDIA\u2019s product offerings but also the broader shift toward AI and advanced computational models across industries. As businesses continue to integrate AI into their operations, NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are becoming increasingly essential, driving demand and, consequently, revenue growth.\nCurrently, NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are PayPal PYPL, AudioEye AEYE and Aspen Technology AZPN, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PayPal\u2019s 2024 earnings has been revised 19 cents upward to $4.42 per share in the past 30 days, which suggests a year-over-year decline of 13.3%. The company has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 15.9%.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AudioEye\u2019s 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 10 cents to 47 cents per share in the past 30 days, which calls for an increase of 327.3% on a year-over-year basis. The company has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 25%.\nThe consensus mark for Aspen Technology\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 10.4% to $7.43 per share over the past 30 days, which indicates a 13.8% decrease from that reported in 2023.

        "Text": "AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will report its second-quarter results of fiscal 2025 on Aug. 28, with significant attention expected on management's comments regarding potential delays in the release of its next-generation Blackwell (BW) chip, and the company's ability to meet demand.\nStifel analysts said Monday their discussions with industry participants revealed that any delays are likely to be measured in months rather than quarters. In the interim, feedback on the demand for H-Series chips remains positive.\nAs a result, the investment bank again expects a beat-and-raise scenario for Nvidia\u2019s upcoming results and guidance.\n\u201cWe are not expecting any meaningful change in tone or messaging relative to what NVDA has focused on since the company reported its F1Q results, i.e. the company\u2019s longer-term road map and continued investment in organic and collaborative software offerings,\u201d Stifel analysts said in a note.\nMoreover, they believe that recent commentary from optical transceiver module supply chain companies indicates rapidly increasing cluster sizes, which could benefit the chipmaker ahead of the calendar year 2025.\nSeparately, UBS analysts said they see upside to Nvidi\u2019a July print, anticipating continued strength from the data center segment, which could reach as high as $26 billion, above the Street\u2019s estimate of $25 billion.\nKey bullish indicators include strong results from SMCI driven by Hopper demand, significant quarter-over-quarter growth in high-performance computing for TSMC, robust results in KYEC's data processing segment, and strong AI server sales from Quanta Computer.\nHowever, Taiwan's data processing export data suggests a lower figure, though analysts note this data's historical variability and its exclusion of critical Nvidia revenue streams like H20 ramping in China and networking.\nFor guidance, UBS expects strong demand for Hopper and H200 to drive Nvidia to guide toward $31-32 billion, with an implied data center revenue close to $28 billion.\n\u201cWe believe investor bogeys are already in this range (Street revenue is ~$31.5B) which optically doesn't create a great setup, but we believe Blackwell commentary will overshadow wherever guidance comes out as investors are already looking to the BW ramp in 2025, and we believe NVDA will generally communicate that BW is \"on track\",\u201d said UBS analysts.\nThe main concern is how Nvidia will address its previous statement about expecting \"significant\" Blackwell revenue this year, which analysts believe was unrealistic given that customer volume shipments were initially set for mid-December and have now been delayed by 4-6 weeks.\nRelated Articles\nNvidia earnings preview: Blackwell commentary to overshadow guidance numbers\nFactbox-Airlines suspend flights as Middle East tensions rise\nAlaska Air, Hawaiian deal advances as DOJ ends antitrust review\n"

        "Title": "Morning Bid: As Nvidia awaited, Treasuries absorb new deluge",
        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\nNvidia's post-bell earnings update on Wednesday is keeping stock markets everywhere in a holding pattern, while U.S. Treasury markets appear to be absorbing the latest torrent of debt sales quite comfortably.\nThe wait for the world's most dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker's earnings has sucked all the oxygen out of the early part of the week, so large now is the influence of the $3.1 trillion-valued firm on wider stock indexes.\nEquity options traders are expecting Nvidia's report to spark a more than $300 billion swing in its shares over the day ahead. Pricing anticipates a stock move of almost 10% on Thursday - larger than the expected move ahead of any Nvidia report over the last three years.\nThe stock gained more than 1% on Tuesday and was marginally higher in out of hours trading early on Wednesday. S&P500 and Nasdaq futures held steady.\nThe stakes are higher than ever, given the recent creeping doubts about AI overspend and the lack of end product so far for the new tech. Apple's planned announcement on Sept. 9 of a new iPhone with new AI functionality, however, may ease some of those concerns.\nAnd it's a big earnings day more broadly for Big Tech - with Salesforce also reporting and CrowdStrike updating following a July flub that sparked a worldwide computer outage.\nBut while the S&P500 has stopped short of new record highs awaiting the Nvidia results, the market remains buoyant with the Federal Reserve now finally set to cut interest rates in three weeks' time.\nNowhere has that been clearer than in the ease with which Treasury sold another $69 billion of two-year notes on Tuesday. Demand was stronger than forecast and, at 3.86% early on Wednesday, 2-year yields are eyeing 15-month lows.\nAnother $70 billion of 5-year paper hits the street later today, with the total of bills and coupons up for grabs this week alone surpassing half a trillion dollars.\nTreasury is frontloading the new debt in short maturities and almost three quarters of that huge total this week is in bills with tenors of less than 12 months - a move that will see some benefit to debt servicing costs as Fed rates tumble.\nBut the good reception for the new two-year notes and with one eye on how all those bills eventually get refinanced over the years ahead, the inverted yield curve between two and 10 years narrowed to just 3 basis points - its smallest in three weeks.\nThe latest U.S. economic releases provide little bar to those souped-up easing expectations - now running at as much as 104 basis points over the remainder of the year.\nAlthough consumer confidence rose to a six-month high in August, Americans are becoming more anxious about the labor market - the cooling of which is now front and center of the Fed's focus.\nAnd despite multiple supply anxieties from the Middle East to Libya, oil prices were on the wane again on Wednesday - and still clocking year-on-year losses of more than 5%.\nThe dollar was pretty mixed on all that. Its DXY index was a touch higher as the euro retreated following some soft euro zone lending data and expectations that the European Central Bank will now cut for the second time next month before the Fed even gets going.\nDollar/yen was a touch firmer despite relatively hawkish Bank of Japan comments. BOJ Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino restated the central bank's intention to continue lifting interest rates if inflation stayed on course, while closely monitoring financial market conditions.\nIn politics, the latest national opinion polls continue to show Vice President Kamala Harris marginally ahead of challenger Donald Trump and she remains favorite to win at bookmakers - with the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showing her also ahead on her economic policy stance.\nHarris and running mate Tim Walz are expected to interview with CNN TV on Thursday.\nTrump, meantime, faced a revised federal indictment on Tuesday accusing him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election loss, with prosecutors narrowing their approach after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution.\nIn Europe, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned on Tuesday of a 'painful' budget ahead and travelled to Berlin on Wednesday to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nSterling has been buoyed since before Labour's recent election win in part on expectations the new government will ease relations with former European Union partners and seek to soften some of the economically-damaging post-Brexit agreement.\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:\n* Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller in India and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks\n* US corporate earnings: Nvidia, Salesforce, CrowdStrike, HP, NetApp, JM Smucker, Cooper Companies, Bath & Body Works\n* US Treasury sells $70 billion of 5-year notes, sells two-year FRNs\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by Gareth Jones; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n"

        "Title": "Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): \u2018It\u2019s The King\u2019",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Wants You to Check These 10 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the Jim Cramer-approved stocks.\nJim Cramer noticed a strange pattern during the recent winning streak last week. According to Cramer, when a company reported earnings that were better than expected, its stock price would rise significantly. Even if the results were just a bit better than feared, the stock still went up. Conversely, if a company posted disappointing earnings, the market largely ignored it, believing it was just a temporary setback because the Fed might soon cut interest rates. This led to continued buying. However, this trend changed today as reality began to take hold.\n\"You see, we had a very odd pattern during the winning streak. It was a bit of Pangloss and a nip of Camelot. When a company reported a better-than-expected quarter, it was great. When a company reported a quarter that was just better than feared, the stock still rose. And when a company reported a bad quarter, we decided that it was the last bad quarter because the Fed was about to cut rates, so it was no big deal\u2014buy anyway. In other words, companies could do no wrong, but not today. Today, we had a bit of a reckoning, a dose of reality.\"\nJim Cramer pointed out that Tuesday\u2019s market drop was anticipated because the S&P had been rising for eight straight days, and a ninth day would have been unusual, something not seen since 2004. The day was challenging, with the Dow falling 62 points and the S&P dropping 2%, which felt like a bigger loss. This raises concerns about whether the market can continue to rise, especially since negative news finally led to a decline after a strong eight-day rally.\n\"We were due for today's modest pullback\u2014the S&P had been up for eight straight days, and nine straight would have put us in rarefied territory. We haven't seen that kind of winning streak since 2004. Today\u2019s session was rough, with the Dow off by 62 points and the S&P dipping 2%, like losing 33%. We have to wonder if the market still has the momentum to go higher because today we got bad news, and guess what\u2014stocks actually went down. That didn\u2019t happen much during the 8-day gain.\"\nJim Cramer observed that the market had been in a phase where strong performance drove stock prices up, and even poor results were overlooked because of the belief that the Fed would intervene. However, after seven days of gains, he suggested that this optimistic trend might be ending. The market has now reached a point where stocks no longer automatically benefit from positive bias.\n\"People had been reporting a perfect market scenario where good performance led to stock gains, and poor performance was cushioned by expectations that the Fed would step in to save the day. But after seven relentlessly positive days, we have to accept that stocks may no longer get the benefit of the doubt. We've reached a point where the market is sufficiently elevated, and we're back to business as usual\u2014where the good stocks rise, and the bad ones fall. At these high levels, we can't just dismiss the bears with \"heads I win, tails you lose.\" There's a return to rationality, and rationality is the enemy of a market where everything rallies indiscriminately.\"\nCramer also mentioned that many investors are hoping for the Fed to step in during their meeting at Jackson Hole on Friday. If those expectations aren't met, there could be significant selling pressure, particularly on a summer Friday. He noted that Lowe's recently suffered because the market might be entering a phase where multiple rate cuts are necessary, but there's no clear indication that such cuts are on the way. Without them, the company may struggle to turn its business around quickly.\n\"It doesn\u2019t help that many expect the Fed cavalry to show up on Friday when they head to Jackson Hole. If things don\u2019t go as expected, there could be a lot of selling, especially since it's a summer Friday.\"\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we analyzed a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money and selected ten stocks he talked about. We also included information on how hedge funds feel about each stock and ranked them based on the number of hedge funds that own them, from the fewest to the most.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hegde Fund Investors: 179\nJim Cramer discussed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s dominant position in the market, comparing it to a king with the rest of the market's stocks as its pawns. He expressed concerns about the pressure on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), questioning whether it can maintain its leading role without experiencing significant setbacks. Cramer noted that, based on Larry Williams' analysis, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) might face a peak and subsequent decline in the near term.\nCramer highlighted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s current chart suggests a peak might occur next week, potentially leading to a sell-off that could extend through mid to late October. He acknowledged that while he hopes Larry's prediction is wrong, the analysis provides a valid basis for considering a possible downturn, especially if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s future outlook does not meet expectations.\n\"I almost feel like you can guess it\u2014it's Nvidia. It's the king, and the rest of the market is made up of its pawns, marching to Nvidia's drum. Remember this morning when I was on the call and said, \"Look, Nvidia is almost too important. There's too much pressure on Nvidia\u2014can it sustain it? I don't want Nvidia to be Samson.\"\nIn the second quarter of 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) achieved revenue of $13.5 billion, a 20% increase from the previous year, and earnings per share (EPS) of $3.08, surpassing analysts' expectations by 10%. This solid performance highlights the company's effective growth strategy. A key driver of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s positive outlook is its leading role in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s GPUs, including the A100 and H100 series, are critical for AI training and inference, positioning NVIDIA as a major player in the AI industry. Additionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s data center business, which generated $8.5 billion in Q2 2024, has grown significantly due to the rising demand for AI and machine learning technologies.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s market position is further strengthened by strategic partnerships with top tech companies such as\nMicrosoft Corporation\n(NASDAQ:MSFT) and\nAlphabet Inc.\n(NASDAQ:GOOG), boosting its market reach and growth opportunities. The acquisition of Mellanox Technologies also enhances its data center capabilities, setting up the company for continued expansion.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the most impressive growth stocks of all time, but it has pulled back by more than 10% from its recent highs. However, with shares trading for more than 38 times sales even after the decline, many investors may not want to buy Nvidia stock individually.\nThe best way to get exposure to Nvidia in your stock portfolio might be through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has a large allocation to the chipmaking giant but also owns plenty of other stocks. Here are two in particular that you might want to take a closer look at right now.\nNvidia is certainly the most prolific chipmaker in the market right now, and for good reason, but it isn't the only one that is benefiting from the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investment. The Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXQ) could be a great way to invest.\nFor one thing, its 0.19% expense ratio is among the lowest in the semiconductor ETF space and is extremely low for a narrowly focused index fund in general.\nThis is a rather concentrated ETF with just 30 holdings, all of which are semiconductor manufacturers (chipmakers). As you might expect, large companies make up the bulk of the holdings, but more than one-fifth of the portfolio is small and mid-cap stocks. Nvidia is the highest-weighted holding with a 14% allocation, and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u00a0(NYSE: TSM), and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) round out the top five.\nSo, if you want to buy the post-earnings dip in Nvidia, but you're bullish on the chipmaking industry as a whole, this could be an ETF to put on your watch list.\nAlthough Nvidia has been in the headlines recently since it is the most recent of the megacaps to report earnings, it's important to realize that it isn't the only \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that has pulled back recently. In fact, with the S&P 500 close to its all-time high, it might surprise you to learn that five out of the seven stocks are down by more than 10% from their 52-week highs.\nCompany (Symbol)\nPercent Below 52-Week High\nNvidia (NVDA)\n10.4%\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)\n13.7%\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\n1%\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\n2.9%\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\n10.2%\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n23%\nAmazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN)\n13%\nData source: yCharts. Percentages as of 8/29/2024.\nNow, I'm not saying that these stocks have become \"cheap\" by any definition. All of the Magnificent Seven stocks trade for price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples that are well above that of the average S&P 500 company. But they also have tons of growth potential, and if you're a believer that these winners will keep winning, you can invest in all seven with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS).\nThe ETF offers equal-weight exposure to all seven stocks and comes with a reasonable 0.29% expense ratio. If you think the pullbacks in companies like Alphabet and Amazon.com have been overdone in addition to Nvidia, this ETF could be worth a closer look right now.\nBoth of these are solid ETFs with reasonable fees, and the best choice for you depends on what your investment goals are and what groups of stocks you want exposure to. After Nvidia's latest earnings, if you think the recent pullback has gone a bit too far and want to invest but don't necessarily want to open a large position in Nvidia itself, these two ETFs could be smart choices for your portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II - Invesco Phlx Semiconductor ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II - Invesco Phlx Semiconductor ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other tech stocks to monitor amid market volatility.\nIn the past few weeks, a major selloff in the technology sector, mostly over concerns about return on investments amid ballooning capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), has hit the stock market, sending valuations crashing and igniting fears of an AI bubble at the marketplace that might be about to burst. However, Stacy Rasgon, who has covered semiconductor stocks, one of the most prominent sectors in the AI world, for over fifteen years, has advised investors to stay the course, terming fears of a bubble as overblown. Rasgon claims that even though chances of an air pocket, used to refer to stock plunges, are 100%, he is confident the time for them is not now. He pointed to the very real and massive AI data center build as an example, predicting it would go on for a few years, helping push AI stocks higher.\nIn a recent interview with IBD, Rasgon zeroed in on semi stocks, highlighting that they had been massively outperforming, mostly on AI. However, he cautioned investors about potential upside to these firms outside of AI, like in the PCs or smartphones business, noting that even though they might be better than last year, it was evident they would not be growing at a rapid pace anytime soon. He also added that outside of AI, data center, server CPU, and networking demand remained weak. Bernstein, the investment advisory where Rasgon practices his trade, recently revealed a basket of prominent stocks in the tech, media, and communications domain that had upside potential of almost 26% to price targets by the advisory.\nThis list comes amid worries over the state of the job market and consumer spending in the United States, as well as a potential artificial intelligence air pocket. Bernstein analysts have advised investors to put their money to work in this period of heightened market volatility. Several AI-related tech names are trading at huge discounts due to the selloff, with some of these names discussed in detail below. More information about these firms can be found by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 17 Trending AI Stocks According to Latest News And Analyst Ratings.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected companies who operate in the tech domain and have been on the radar of Wall Street analysts. An important investor note by investment bank Bernstein formed the basis for this list. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\u00a0\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon recently appeared on CNBC to highlight his bullish views on the AI revolution, naming NVIDIA as the top pick in the sector with lots of room to run even with recent worries about capex and ROI, simply because demand remained high. He noted that the company had enormous potential in the AI data center space. He added that the depth in enterprise AI adoption was encouraging, even though it was moving at a pace that was slower than expected. He underlined how large customers comprised more than 40% of the overall revenue of NVIDIA, even as it developed a larger customer base.\nInvestment advisory Bernstein has an Outperform rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock with a price target of $130. In a recent investor note, the advisory said it was not panicking yet as media reports suggested a three month delay to the Blackwell roadmap by NVIDIA. Analysts at the advisory suggested that at a minimum, despite recent worries over AI ROI, it remained clear that demand levels were continuing to rise and NVIDIA had other products to sell in the meantime to help backfill.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the tech stocks to monitor amid market volatility. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "All eyes are again turning to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) this week.\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) chip superstar is set to report its results for fiscal 2025's second quarter (which ended July 28) after hours on Wednesday, Aug. 28. As with the last several quarterly reports, the results are highly anticipated.\nNvidia is getting a lot more attention these days because of its leadership role in the generative AI revolution. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT accelerated the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) and other more advanced components that many companies use to run complex AI models.\nThere's a lot of speculation around the upcoming earnings report as Nvidia's results are likely to heavily influence whether the stock market, driven by the AI boom, continues its upward swing or whether it pulls back on concerns about a potential AI bubble.\nIt's impossible to consistently predict a company's quarterly results or the market's reaction to them, but Nvidia stock watchers have one advantage: Most of its big tech peers have already reported second-quarter earnings and the CEOs of these companies provided commentary on the state of play in the emerging AI industry. For investors, there were some key insights that offer hints about Nvidia's performance in the second quarter.\nWhile there were some concerns in the stock market that AI stocks could be entering a bubble, especially when shares of Nvidia and its peers fell sharply in July through early August, it's clear that there's still a shortage of Nvidia components as companies rapidly add and expand new data centers.\nSpeaking on Tesla's\u00a0second-quarter earnings call on July 23, CEO Elon Musk not only paid Nvidia a high compliment but underscored the limited supply of its product, saying:\nI should preface this by saying I'm incredibly impressed by Nvidia's execution and the capability of their hardware. And what we are seeing is that the demand for Nvidia hardware is so high that it's often to difficult to get the GPUs. I guess I'm quite concerned about actually being able to get ... Nvidia GPUs and when we want them.\nThere's little doubt from Musk's statement that the supply/demand imbalance that has made prices for Nvidia hardware soar and its sales spike persisted through the second quarter.\nSimilarly, Meta Platforms\u00a0CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered his thoughts on the evolving AI market on the July 31 earnings call, saying, \"We expect that having sufficient compute capacity will be central to many of these opportunities, so we are investing meaningfully in infrastructure to support or core AI work, in content ranking and ads, as well as our generative AI and advanced research efforts.\"\nPhrases like \"having sufficient compute capacity\" and \"investing meaningfully in (AI) infrastructure\" essentially mean \"buying Nvidia components.\"\nMeta CFO Susan Li also made it clear that this trend would only continue to grow as she said, \"Our expectation, obviously again, is that we are going to significantly increase our investments in AI infrastructure next year,\" which bodes well for Nvidia.\nZuckerberg elaborated on his thinking and that of many of his peers during a podcast interview with a Bloomberg reporter. He acknowledged that there was a risk of overspending on AI infrastructure, but added that the bigger risk was underinvesting, \"because the downside of being behind is that you're out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years.\"\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai echoed that sentiment, saying on the company's recent earnings call, \"When we go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here.\"\nFor Nvidia investors, the statements above should offer some reassurance that business continued to boom in the fiscal second quarter as financial reports and statements from the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies indicated that spending on AI infrastructure continued to soar and tech giants like Meta Platforms expect it to continue to do so into next year.\nWhether Nvidia stock gains on its earnings report will depend on how its results compare to analyst estimates. Currently, the average Wall Street analyst expects revenue of $25.64 billion in the quarter, up 90% from the quarter a year ago, and calls for adjusted earnings per share to jump from $1.19 in fiscal 2024's Q2 to $2.45.\nThe CEO statements above aren't a guarantee that Nvidia will rise on its earnings report, but they do offer strong evidence that the AI chip titan has a bright future ahead of it as the big tech companies all intend to keep buying its product.\nThat's reason enough to buy Nvidia stock before earnings, regardless of how it moves on Thursday.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  SARAH PARVINI ",
        "Text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Nvidia may have exceeded Wall Street estimates as its profit jumped \u2014 buffeted by the chipmaking dominance that has cemented Nvidia\u2019s place as the poster child of the artificial intelligence boom \u2014 but investors seemed less than impressed.\nThe company reported a net income of to $16.6 billion. Adjusted for one-time items, net income was $16.95 billion. Revenue rose to $30 billion, up 122% from a year ago and 15% from the previous quarter.\nBy comparison, S&P 500 companies overall are expected to deliver just 5% growth in revenue for the quarter, according to FactSet. Still, Nvidia shares slipped nearly 4% in after-hours trading.\nRyan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, said that despite growing revenue \u201cit appears the bar was just set a tad too high this earnings season.\u201d\n\u201cDeath, taxes, and NVDA beats on earnings are three things you can bank on,\u201d Detrick said. \u201cHere\u2019s the issue. The size of the beat this time was much smaller than we\u2019ve been seeing. Even future guidance was raised, but again not by the tune from previous quarters.\u201d\nThe company reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents per share, up from 27 cents a year ago. Nvidia said it expects third quarter revenue to grow to $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%.\nNvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company's chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.\n\u201cThe people who are investing in Nvidia infrastructure are getting returns on it right away,\u201d Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said on a call with analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s the best ROI infrastructure, computing infrastructure investment you can make today.\u201d\nDemand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia\u2019s specialized chips over the last year. In June, Nvidia briefly rose to become the most valuable company in the S&P 500. The company is now worth over $3 trillion.\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said during the analyst call that the company is planning to increase production of its Blackwell AI chips beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing through fiscal 2026. Kress said Nvidia expects several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue in the fourth quarter, with shipments of its Hopper graphics processor unit, or GPU, expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Television, Huang said the company will \u201chave a great next year as well.\u201d\nThrough the year\u2019s first six months, Nvidia\u2019s stock price soared nearly 150%. At that point, it was trading at a little more than 100 times the company\u2019s earnings over the prior 12 months. That\u2019s much more expensive than it\u2019s been historically and than the S&P 500 in general. That's why analysts warn of a selloff if Wall Street sees any indication that AI demand is waning.\nDan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, called the earnings part of a \u201chistoric, meteoric rise from Nvidia and the godfather of AI, Jensen (Huang).\u201d Investors, Ives added, are picking apart \u201crobust numbers\u201d and trying to find holes in them. Although Nvidia said it estimates about $32.5 billion in revenue in the third fiscal quarter, some analysts expected a slightly higher figure, he said.\n\u201cI view it as kind of like splitting hairs,\u201d Ives said. The demand for AI technology is only accelerating, he added, echoing Huang's previous statements that the world is in the midst of the next industrial revolution.\n\u201cThis is the most watched earnings \u2014 not just in tech, but in the market, in many years,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors will initially overreact to any sort of short-lived weakness. But I believe this actually put more fuel into the tank of the bull market.\u201d\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) nearly $3 trillion valuation hinges on a critical assumption: The company's utter dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator market is sustainable. Nvidia's market share has been estimated as high as 95%, and while competitors including AMD and Intel offer AI chips of their own, they've made little headway against the Nvidia juggernaut.\nHere's the problem: That assumption is probably not going to hold up in the long run. Nvidia has some important advantages, including a mature software ecosystem and best-in-class hardware, but cracks are starting to form. The biggest crack so far is Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) decision to avoid Nvidia's GPUs entirely while training its highly anticipated Apple Intelligence platform.\nApple is late to the generative AI party, but it's now full steam ahead bringing AI features to its iPhones, Macs, and other devices. Apple Intelligence, which will go into beta later this year, includes AI-powered writing tools, image creation capabilities, a version of Siri that isn't embarrassing, and other useful features. None of this is groundbreaking, but these features will be deeply integrated into Apple's ecosystem and available to the company's massive user base.\nApple has trained multiple AI models, including powerful server-based models that will run in the cloud and more compact models that will run directly on Apple devices. Training an AI model is computationally intensive, and Nvidia's GPUs have been the standard choice since the AI boom began. Apple notably took a different route.\nApple detailed the AI models that power Apple Intelligence in a recent research paper, and the big surprise is that the tech giant shunned Nvidia's GPUs entirely. The server-based models were trained on 8,192 TPUv4 AI chips from Alphabet's Google, while the on-device models were trained on a smaller number of TPUv5 AI chips.\nGoogle has been designing custom AI chips for years. The company's sixth-generation TPU, called Trillium, was announced in May. Google uses its custom chips to train its own AI models, and now Apple has chosen to do the same.\nApple's decision kills the argument that Nvidia's GPUs are the only game in town for AI training.\nThe AI chip market could grow fast enough for Nvidia's revenue to continue to rise at a healthy pace even if it loses market share. However, it's hard to imagine that Nvidia will be able to maintain its sky-high profit margins as competition chips away at its dominance.\nNvidia reported a net income of $14.9 billion on $26 billion in revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, ended April 28. It is highly unlikely that Nvidia will be able to maintain a net income margin above 50% in the long run. Competition will inevitably bring the company's profitability back down to earth.\nAI inference, the act of using trained AI models, doesn't necessarily require powerful GPUs at all. Intel's latest Xeon server CPUs, for example, can run some inference workloads, and PCs with dedicated AI chips are set to become the norm. AI training does require powerful accelerators, but Apple's choice to avoid Nvidia's GPUs is a strong sign that Nvidia's dominance of the AI training market is coming to an end.\nNvidia's AI growth story has been incredible, but Apple just delivered a serious blow to the AI king.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The U.S. Federal Reserve has held interest rates steady since August 2023, when it last raised the federal funds rate to a 23-year high of 5.33%. But with inflation cooling and the unemployment rate ticking up, many Wall Street pundits predict the Fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting on Sept. 17 and 18.\nFalling interest rates are typically good for the stock market -- and I'll explain why in a moment -- but since a September rate cut is now widely expected, it's unlikely to have a substantial impact on the market. Instead, I think investors should be focused on Aug. 28, which is the date Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) will report its earnings for the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 31).\nNvidia stock has soared 187% over the past year alone on the back of the company's blockbuster financial results, so here's why its upcoming report could have a much bigger effect on investor sentiment than the Fed meeting.\nNvidia designs the most powerful data center chips for developing artificial intelligence (AI) models. Demand is outstripping supply and it's coming from a broad customer base, which includes established tech giants like Microsoft, and start-ups like ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\nNvidia's H100 graphics processor (GPU) set the benchmark for the AI industry last year. Some tech companies have built clusters of over 100,000 GPUs, and considering they sell for up to $40,000 each, this has quickly become a multibillion-dollar market annually. In fact, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks data center operators will spend $1 trillion upgrading and expanding their infrastructure over the next five years.\nThose operators include Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, to name a few. They build data centers, fill them with Nvidia's GPUs, and rent the computing capacity to businesses and developers who use it to create and deploy AI. Huang says data center operators can earn $5 in revenue over four years for every $1 they spend on Nvidia's chips, so it's a lucrative business for all parties.\nNvidia had a market share of over 90% in 2023, so it's positioned to capture a significant chunk of that $1 trillion in value -- depending how quickly the competition catches up. Most chip makers are releasing their own GPUs and benchmarking them against the H100, but Nvidia has already launched the H200 which can perform AI inference at twice the speed of its predecessor.\nPlus, next year, Nvidia will begin shipping high volumes of its next-generation GPUs which are built on its new Blackwell architecture. The Blackwell-based GB200, for example, will be capable of performing AI inference five-times faster than the H100, so it's a substantial leap. AI developers often pay for computing capacity by the minute, so faster chips can translate to significant cost savings.\nThat will buoy demand for Nvidia's latest chips, and we should learn more about the rollout in the company's Aug. 28 report.\nAccording to Nvidia's guidance, the company will show $28 billion in total revenue when it reports its results for the fiscal 2025 second quarter. That's much higher than the $26.6 billion forecast Wall Street originally expected, but analysts have since revised their consensus estimate to $28.5 billion. That means Nvidia's own guidance might even be too conservative!\nIt's no surprise, because Nvidia has made a habit of beating expectations. In the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), the company delivered $26 billion in total revenue which was well above its original guidance of $24 billion, and also above Wall Street's estimate of $24.6 billion.\nThe result was headlined by $22.6 billion in data center revenue alone, which represented a whopping 427% increase from the year-ago period.\nThat's the number investors should watch in the upcoming Q2 report. Anything above Wall Street's estimate of $25 billion will be a positive read-through for tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. It's a direct reflection of their AI infrastructure spending, which represents their confidence in the technology going forward.\nNvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet account for 20.4% of the entire value of the S&P 500 index. Meta Platforms and Tesla, who are also big buyers of Nvidia's GPUs, together account for another 3.8% of the index.\nTherefore, this group of tech companies could influence the direction of the overall stock market going forward, which is why I think so much is hinging on Nvidia's Aug. 28 report.\nInterest rate cuts can be good for the stock market because they reduce the yield on risk-free assets like cash and Treasuries, pushing investors into growth assets like stocks and real estate instead. Plus, lower rates will allow companies to borrow more money to fuel growth, and companies with existing debt could see their repayments fall, which is a tailwind for their earnings.\nHowever, history suggests the S&P 500 could suffer a temporary decline once the Fed starts cutting interest rates. In past instances, the Fed was cutting because of dire economic conditions -- like the dotcom tech crash in 2000, the global financial crisis in 2008, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The S&P 500 fell on each occasion.\nWhile there is no sign of an impending crisis in the U.S. economy right now, unemployment has ticked higher to 4.3% (from 3.7% in January), which is a sign there could be weakness on the horizon, especially in areas like consumer spending. If the economy does slow, that will hurt corporate earnings which could send the stock market lower, even while the Fed is slashing rates.\nWith that said, the CME Group's FedWatch tool assigns a 100% probability to a September rate cut, and since the economy is still quite strong, it shouldn't trigger a negative response from investors.\nFor that reason, I attach far more weight to Nvidia's upcoming earnings report on Aug. 28, because it genuinely has the potential to influence the direction of the market.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "AI leader NVIDIA NVDA is set to release its fiscal second-quarter 2025 results after the market\u2019s close on Aug. 28. The chipmaker has risen 18.7% over the past three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 14.9%. The strong trend will continue if NVIDIA beats earnings estimates.\u00a0ETFs having the largest allocation to NVIDIA will be in focus ahead of its earnings report. These include Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Grizzle Growth ETF DARP and TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF LRNZ.\nNVIDIA currently has an Earnings ESP of -2.25% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The world\u2019s largest chipmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. However, NVIDIA is expected to post triple-digit earnings (33.3%) and revenue (109%) growth for the to-be-reported quarter. NVIDIA\u2019s earnings surprise history is good, as it delivered an earnings surprise of 18.43%, on average, in the last four quarters (read: Here's How You Can Play NVIDIA's Earnings).\nMany analysts are bullish on the stock ahead of NVIDIA\u2019s earnings release. Wedbush expects the chipmaker to deliver another \u201cdrop the mic performance,\u201d citing signs of \"massive enterprise AI demand\" and spending by cloud giants such as Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL), all trends that would benefit the chipmaker. Analysts from Raymond James and KeyBanc also stated they expect a strong quarter from the chipmaker despite concerns about a reported delay in NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell AI chip.NVIDIA currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.25 a month ago based on 40 recommendations. Of the 40 recommendations, 35 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy account for 87.5% and 5%, respectively, compared to 85% and 5% a month ago.Based on short-term price targets offered by 40 analysts, the average price target for NVIDIA comes to $141.90. The forecasts range from a low of $90.00 to a high of $200.00.\nNVIDIA has been at the forefront of technology companies' race to build AI into their products and services. Its success is largely attributed to its leadership in developing advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including generative AI, the technology backing OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT that can create text, images and other media.\u00a0Major cloud service providers rely on NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs to train and run AI applications. The company\u2019s clients include around 20,000 start-ups, along with big names like Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. The company holds an 80% market share in AI chips for data centers (read: Are Semiconductor ETFs Better Bets on AI Boom Than Big Techs?).\u00a0Demand for NVIDIA\u2019s H100 accelerators has been on a surge. Its next-generation GPU chip is expected to drive another round of massive growth. For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the graphics chipmaker expects revenues of around $28 billion, plus or minus 2%.Meanwhile, investors will be keen on watching updates on Blackwell chips, which have been rumored to be delayed by up to three months or more.\nNVDA\u2019s expensive valuation has been a cause for concern in recent months. But given the astounding surge the stock has enjoyed since the end of 2022, its valuation does not seem overstretched. NVIDIA is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 49.8 versus 53.58 for the industry.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFurther, the stock is currently trading at a PEG ratio of 1.25, much lower than the industry average of 4.13, suggesting that it is a better value stock in the industry.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors have been on a wild ride this year. The artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker soared as much as 174% in 2024, as excitement about the rapid adoption of generative AI has captivated Wall Street and Main Street alike. With those gains, however, has come extreme volatility, as the value of this emerging opportunity remains uncertain.\nIn recent weeks, the stock reversed course, plunging as much as 25%. Fears about the state of the economy have called into question the staying power of AI and how much further Nvidia can grow from here. The stock has regained much of those losses, but the questions remain.\nOne analyst believes Wall Street is setting its sights too low.\nHSBC analyst Frank Lee recently reiterated his buy rating on Nvidia stock and increased his price target to $145. That represents potential upside for investors of 14% compared to Tuesday's closing price. The analyst believes that Nvidia will report $30 billion in sales for its fiscal second quarter, generating revenue of $33 billion and $36 billion in the quarters that follow.\nThe analyst notes that spending to upgrade data centers is on track to continue into 2025, driven by strong demand for generative AI.\nThe analyst has obviously done his homework. The three biggest cloud infrastructure providers, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, which are Nvidia's biggest customers, have all been crystal clear about plans to increase their capital expenditure spending to meet the accelerating demand for AI. As the gold standard for AI processing, Nvidia is likely to be the beneficiary of much of that spending.\nFurthermore, the company's biggest partners and rivals are reporting strong sales, which suggests Nvidia's results will be equally robust.\nIf the analyst's calculations are correct, Nvidia's revenue will top $125 billion in fiscal 2025, more than double the $61 billion it earned last year -- and marking its second consecutive year of triple-digit growth.\nThat's why Nvidia stock is a buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Huawei Technologies is gearing up to release a new artificial intelligence (AI) chip positioning itself as a competitor to Nvidia in the Chinese market, reports The Wall Street Journal.\nCalled the Ascend 910C, the chip is currently undergoing tests by Chinese internet and telecom companies.\nThis move comes as a direct challenge to Nvidia's dominance in China, especially in light of recent US sanctions that have restricted Nvidia from selling its advanced chips, including the H100, to Chinese customers.\nThe Ascend 910C is touted to be comparable to Nvidia's H100, according to Huawei's discussions with potential clients.\nThe US restrictions have significantly impacted Nvidia, prompting the company to introduce three chips tailored for the Chinese market, including the H20.\nHowever, these chips have deliberately reduced computing power to comply with US sanctions.\nHuawei, which is facing production delays and potential disruption caused by further US restrictions, aims to start shipping the Ascend 910C as early as October 2024.\nInitial talks with potential customers such as ByteDance, Baidu, and China Mobile suggest a strong demand for Huawei's new chip, with orders potentially exceeding 70,000 units and a total value of around $2bn (14.3bn yuan), sources said.\nThis development is indicative of Huawei's resilience in the face of American efforts to limit its access to cutting-edge technology.\nIn fact, a recent analysis of Huawei\u2019s Mate 60 Pro smartphone uncovered a chip produced by China's leading chipmaker SMIC that supports 5G, despite US sanctions.\nHuawei's consumer business, which includes smartphones and laptops, is also showing signs of a comeback, presenting a challenge to Apple in China.\nThe US has targeted Huawei with sanctions since 2018, aiming to protect its networks and supply chains.\nThe sanctions escalated in 2019, with a trade blacklist preventing US companies from selling technology to Huawei, including 5G chips.\nIn 2020, the restrictions tightened further, and in May, the US revoked licenses from companies such as Intel and Qualcomm to sell chips to Huawei, citing national security and foreign policy interests.\nMeanwhile, China is bolstering its domestic chip industry, investing approximately $48bn (343.2bn yuan) into a third chip fund to strengthen its tech sector.\n\"Huawei set to unveil AI chip in China, challenging Nvidia \" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Title": "Should You Buy the Dip in Nvidia Stock?",
        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "With shares down 14% from an all-time high of $136 hit two months ago, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) rocketship rally seems to be unraveling, even as revenue and earnings continue to hit new records. While the chipmaker is still arguably one of the best companies in the world, the market may be losing excitement about the artificial intelligence (AI) industry in general.\nLet's explore the pros and cons of the current situation to decide whether investors should buy the dip or avoid this declining stock. \nThe truth is that no stock can continue rising at a parabolic rate forever. After gaining over 600% since the start of 2023, Nvidia was due for a pullback. That said, some emerging macroeconomic challenges could eventually spell fundamental trouble for the high-flying company.\nAnalysts at J.P. Morgan think the U.S. economy has a 35% chance of entering a recession by the end of the year. A downturn could wreak havoc on Nvidia's business model, because its high-end AI graphics processing units (GPUs) are essentially tech sector luxury items. \nFor starters, these chips are expensive, with Nvidia's H100 costing between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit. Thousands of these units are needed to train and run large language models (LLMs). The industry is also notoriously difficult to monetize because of high competition, weak competitive moats, and technical limitations. Corporations would most likely slash their investments in this speculative sector during a recession. \nIf Nvidia has anything, it's a spectacular growth rate. First-quarter revenue soared 262% year over year to $26 billion, powered by sales of the company's most advanced data center chips like the H100. Most importantly, these products boast high margins, which allowed Nvidia to increase its operating profit by almost 700% to $16.9 billion.\nHowever, a stock's performance is typically based on future expectations, not past performance. It's unclear how Nvidia will manage to top these already breathtaking results, especially without a substantial breakthrough on the consumer-facing software side of the AI industry.\nThe company's remarkably high gross margin of 78.4% also suggests it is selling its products at an unsustainable markup over the cost of producing them. This dynamic is sure to draw attention from suppliers like TSMC, which announced plans to raise its production fees in 2025. And while Nvidia is successfully keeping the competition at bay through its rapid update cycle, there is no guarantee that the company can maintain its deep economic moat forever. \nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 40, Nvidia doesn't look expensive compared to its astronomical growth rate. For context, rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices trades for the same multiple despite only growing sales by 9% in its most recent quarter (Nvidia grew 262%).\nThat said, Nvidia's business model has become incredibly overexposed to AI hardware demand, making it tied to a very speculative industry that isn't backed by a track record of revenue and profits. Increasingly difficult comps will also make it harder for the company to sustain its current levels of growth over the coming years. \nAll in all, Nvidia stock isn't horrible, and most of the near-term downside might already be priced in. However, I would like to see more progress on the consumer side of the AI industry before buying this dip. \nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other fast money stocks.\nAs the financial world grapples with shifting economic indicators and political uncertainty, insights from leading experts offer a crucial perspective on what lies ahead. With inflation showing signs of easing and the Federal Reserve signaling a likely rate cut, the focus now shifts to earnings performance and broader economic trends. Adding to this complexity are political developments, such as the possibility of a Republican sweep.\nThe latest June 2024 inflation report revealed a softer-than-expected outcome, causing varied reactions across major stock indices. Initially, futures surged in response, but have since fluctuated. Currently, the Dow is showing gains, the S&P is up slightly, and the NASDAQ is just below the flatline. Inflation dropped by a tenth of a percent month-over-month, contrary to economists' forecasts of a rise.\nChris Harvey, Head of Equity Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, and Mike Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JPMorgan, shared their perspectives on the current financial situation in an episode of CNBC's Fast Money. Chris Harvey is cautious about the concept of market rotation due to ongoing uncertainties about earnings. While he doesn't oppose rotation, he pointed out that investor confidence is still shaky.\n\"That\u2019s right. We\u2019re not against rotation; we\u2019re just waiting for more clarity. Many investors are uncertain about earnings. Until we see a situation where companies don\u2019t go down on bad news, we won\u2019t be fully convinced about the rotation. We want people to believe that numbers will improve and that things will get better. However, right now, bad news is bad news, and that suggests the rotation may not be sustainable.\"\nIn contrast, Mike Feroli discussed the anticipated rate cuts. He believes that the Fed is likely to lower rates soon due to its more aggressive stance. Feroli suggests that the economy is weaker than some might think, which supports the expectation of rate cuts. He noted that we have probably reached the peak for interest rates and that future attention will shift to earnings performance.\nFeroli also explained why he updated his forecast to September. This change is based on recent CPI data showing significant inflation drops over the past year and a rise in unemployment. He expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, with additional cuts likely on a quarterly basis.\n\"Yes, the rate cuts are coming. The Fed has signaled their intention to cut rates more aggressively than they have in the past. We also believe the economy isn\u2019t as strong as some might think, so we expect rates to come down. I think we\u2019ve already hit the peak for rates. Right now, it\u2019s really about earnings.\"\nHowever, if the labor market weakens further, the pace of these cuts could accelerate. Regarding the potential impact of a Donald Trump presidency and a possible Republican sweep, Feroli highlighted the uncertainties. A Republican sweep could lead to more tax cuts, possibly extending or expanding those from 2017, which might boost growth but also increase deficits.\nAdditionally, trade and immigration policies remain unpredictable. While deregulation might mitigate some negative effects, the overall policy environment is still uncertain. Finally, when asked about the implications of a Republican sweep for bond markets, Feroli expressed concern about the deficit trajectory. Extending all tax cuts, particularly in a more Republican-leaning scenario, could exacerbate the deficit problem.\nIn another episode of Fast Money, Chris Mman, Chief Investment Officer at Lafayette College, discussed the potential timing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, emphasizing that September appears to be a strong possibility. He notes, however, that the Fed will be influenced by upcoming economic reports. Mman also highlights concerns over equity valuations and the potential impact of delayed rate cuts on the labor market.\n\"I believe July should have been on the table based on today\u2019s report. However, the Fed usually prefers to signal their plans in advance. My expectation was that they probably wouldn't preemptively set up for September, but given today\u2019s report, it seems quite likely they will. The Fed might use upcoming meetings and communications to guide the market's expectations.\"\nAs political uncertainties, including the Democratic ticket's spotlight, add to the mix, Mman reassures that the Fed is likely to focus on economic data rather than political pressures. He stresses that while inflation remains a critical issue, the Fed's priority will be managing employment trends to avoid a deeper economic downturn.\n\"Even if inflation accelerates temporarily, it\u2019s unlikely to concern the Fed greatly. Currently, the focus has shifted more to employment reports rather than inflation. If employment were to unexpectedly strengthen, it could reduce the Fed\u2019s incentive to cut rates. Ultimately, the goal is to avoid a severe economic slowdown that would force them into aggressive rate cuts.\"\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we review recent episodes of CNBC's Fast Money, where Fast Money traders highlighted stocks with high growth potential. We tracked each stock mentioned and ranked them based on frequency. From this, we identified the top 7 stocks that were mentioned a lot by Fast Money traders and were widely held by hedge funds.

        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Wall Street analysts are almost unanimous in their view that semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) will rocket higher. However, options traders apparently have a different take, placing contrarian wagers against NVDA stock. The situation has now become a matter of which narrative investors trust more. In my opinion, the market is the ultimate arbiter, and it\u2019s not giving the warm and fuzzies over the tech juggernaut. Therefore, I am bearish on NVDA.\nTo be sure, it\u2019s not surprising that some options traders have flipped sides regarding the sentiment battle over NVDA stock. Last week, the tech company \u2013 which manufactures the advanced graphics processors that make artificial intelligence what it is today \u2013 incurred a fall of 5.1%. This Monday, it was down another 6.4%.\nStill, the overall narrative seems bullish on NVDA stock. According to a Bloomberg report, the generative AI ecosystem could become a $1.3 trillion economy by 2032. That implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42% over the next 10 years, per the article. If so, that\u2019s an excellent reason to consider riding out the volatility in Nvidia.\nFurther, multiple experts \u2013 such as analysts from Piper Sandler and other institutions \u2013 have pounded the table on NVDA stock. Despite the stock\u2019s fall, the red ink could turn out to be an opportunity. However, that\u2019s not what options traders are signaling.\nOn Friday, options flow data for Nvidia stock \u2013 a screener that focuses exclusively on big block transactions likely placed by institutional or professional investors \u2013 revealed that net trade sentiment slipped to negative $5.55 million, thus favoring the bears.\nIn other words, when you tally all the premiums associated with options with bullish sentiment and perform the same exercise for bearish sentiment, the net total is negative. This implies that institutional sentiment has shifted negatively despite the positive stories that we hear about generative AI.\nKeep in mind that Friday wasn\u2019t the only time that options flow turned pessimistic. Since at least last Wednesday\u2019s session, traders have been betting against NVDA stock. Notably, TipRanks\u2019 unusual options activity screener for Nvidia also corroborates this assessment.\nBetween the July 31 session to August 2, traders placed 32 transactions that were deemed bearish in nature. In contrast, only 18 transactions were deemed bullish. By logical deduction, it\u2019s imprudent to assume that Nvidia will continue marching higher without at least considering the possibility of a correction.\nRegardless of one\u2019s view on NVDA stock, the consensus is that Nvidia\u2019s upcoming fiscal second-quarter earnings report \u2013 scheduled for August 28 \u2013 will be especially critical. Most likely, the company won\u2019t just need another beat; rather, it must deliver convincing results combined with encouraging forward guidance. However, that scenario is hardly guaranteed.\nOne of the biggest concerns centers on the declining magnitude of the earnings beats. For example, in Q2 of Fiscal 2024, Nvidia posted earnings per share of 27 cents, beating the consensus view of 21 cents. This yielded an earnings surprise of 28.6%. However, in the subsequent three quarters, the earnings surprises landed as follows: 17.6%, 13%, and 8.9%.\nEssentially, analysts are getting a bit jaded about Nvidia constantly beating per-share profitability estimates. It needs something truly special to impress the Street. However, a company can only dominate for so long before it requires a breather.\nThat\u2019s not a dig against NVDA stock. Both things can be true: Nvidia can be a great long-term investment thanks to its numerous innovations, and it could also be due for a correction.\nTo be fair, NVDA stock looks relatively undervalued at the moment. Right now, shares trade hands at 30.9x trailing-year sales. However, given that analysts project current year (Fiscal 2025) sales to hit $120.73 billion, NVDA\u2019s projected sales multiple is roughly 20.5x (assuming the same share count of 24.6 billion).\nThat\u2019s closer to NVDA\u2019s five-year average price-to-sales ratio (23x). However, during a corrective cycle, a publicly traded asset could drop far lower before reverting back to the mean. Therefore, it wouldn\u2019t be shocking to see NVDA stock fall back to around $50, where strong horizontal support lies. That would put the sales multiple at around 10.2x. At that point, Nvidia would look extremely enticing on the long side.\nTurning to Wall Street, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average NVDA stock price target is $144.17, implying 43.5% upside potential.\nSee more NVDA analyst ratings\nFew experts doubt the long-term narrative of Nvidia and its advanced graphics processors. The question really comes down to the near-term trajectory of NVDA stock. Options traders have been placing bearish wagers against the equity throughout its corrective cycle, suggesting more downside ahead. Further, anything short of a blisteringly robust Q2 earnings print could add to the growing skepticism. Therefore, investors may want to wait on the sidelines until the correction fully fades.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "'Super Bowl' Nvidia earnings stand to test searing AI trade",
        "Author": "  David Randall ",
        "Text": "By David Randall\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The rally in U.S. stocks faces an important test next week with earnings from chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA), whose blistering run has powered markets throughout 2024.\nThe S&P 500 has pared a sharp drop it suffered after U.S. economic worries contributed to a sell-off at the beginning of the month and again stands near a fresh all-time high.\nNvidia, whose chips are widely seen as the gold standard in artificial intelligence, has been at the forefront of that rally, jumping by more than 30% since its recent lows. The stock is up some 150% year-to-date, accounting for around a quarter of the S&P 500\u2019s 17% year-to-date gain.\nThe company\u2019s Aug. 28 earnings report, coupled with guidance on whether it expects corporate investments in AI to continue, could be a key inflection point for market sentiment heading into what is historically a volatile time of the year. The S&P 500 has fallen in September by an average of 0.78% since World War Two, the worst performance of any month, according to CFRA data.\n\"Nvidia is the zeitgeist stock today,\" said Mike Smith, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, which holds the company's shares in its portfolios. \"You can think of their earnings four times a year as the Super Bowl.\"\nSome investors are getting ready for fireworks. Traders are pricing in a swing of around 10.3% in Nvidia\u2019s shares the day after the company reports earnings, according to data from options analytic firm ORATS. That's larger than the expected move ahead of any Nvidia report over the last three years and well above the stock's average post-earnings move of 8.1% over that same period, ORATS data showed.\nThe results come at the end of an earnings season during which investors have taken a less forgiving view of big tech companies whose earnings failed to justify rich valuations or prodigious spending on AI. Examples include Microsoft, Tesla and Alphabet, whose shares are all down since their July reports.\nNvidia\u2019s valuations have also climbed, as the stock soared about 750% since the start of 2023, making it the world\u2019s third-most valuable company as of Thursday, while also drawing comparisons to the dotcom bubble of more than two decades ago. The company\u2019s shares trade at about 37 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, compared with a 20-year average of 29 times, according to LSEG Datastream.\nMarket sentiment could depend as much on Nvidia's guidance as its results. Evidence that it sees robust demand will be a bullish sign that companies are continuing to invest rather than pull back in anticipation of an economic slowdown, said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager, equities, at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.\nNvidia's \"connection to the largest companies in the U.S. stock market makes this a must-watch event,\" he said. \"The biggest piece that investors want to know is whether there is sustainability and what demand will look like in '25 and '26,\" he said.\nThe trajectory of monetary policy and the U.S. economy also looms large for investors. In a Friday morning speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell offered an explicit endorsement of interest rate cuts, saying further cooling in the job market would be unwelcome.\nInvestors will be watching U.S. labor market data on Sept. 6 for evidence of whether last month\u2019s unexpected downshift in employment carried over to August. Signs that employment is continuing to weaken could bring back the recession fears that rocked markets earlier this month.\nA tight presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, and Republican former President Donald Trump may also whip up market uncertainty in the weeks ahead.\nThe August surge in stocks may make it difficult for markets to make much more headway in the near term even if Nvidia\u2019s earnings impress Wall Street, said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, which holds shares of the chipmaker.\nThe S&P 500 trades at 21 times expected earnings, far above its long-term average of 15.7.\n\"The stock market as a whole is still trading at stretched valuations so the bar remains high,\" Belton said.\n(Reporting by David Randall; Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Jonathan Oatis)\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia, Arm, or Broadcom: The Best AI Semiconductor Stock to Buy Now, According to Wall Street",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) will eventually reshape most industries by either eliminating the need for human workers or boosting worker productivity. Analysts generally agree the transformation will happen in phases. They define and ennumerate those phases differently, but infrastructure companies are always the first to benefit.\nTraining machine learning models and running inference on AI applications is contingent upon powerful semiconductors and networking hardware. As a result, chipmakers Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM), and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) have already benefited from AI adoption. Year to date, Nvidia stock has surged 160%, Arm stock has increased 80%, and Broadcom stock has climbed 49%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has advanced 18%.\nHowever, Wall Street believes the leaderboard will look different over the next 12 months. Listed below are the median price targets (and implied upside) for all three stocks as of Aug. 25.\nNvidia: $144 per share (11% implied upside)\nArm: $135 per share (1% implied downside)\nBroadcom: $196 per share (18% implied upside)\nWall Street actually sees downside where Arm stock is concerned. And while analysts expect the other two semiconductor stocks to produce positive returns, Broadcom's median price target implies more upside.\nNvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like scientific computing and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. \"Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\nNvidia also has monetization opportunities beyond GPUs. The company recently introduced its first data center server chip, called Grace, and CEO Jensen Huang says it's ramping toward a multibillion-dollar product line. Nvidia also sells InfiniBand and Ethernet networking platforms. That portion of its business recently achieved a revenue run rate exceeding $12 billion annually.\nFinally, Nvidia has further expanded its ability to monetize AI by delving into software and services. Nvidia AI Enterprise is a suite of subscription software that streamlines the development and deployment of AI applications. And DGX Cloud brings together Nvidia hardware and software to create an end-to-end AI-as-a-service offering. Collectively, Nvidia's software and services segment recently achieved a revenue run rate of $1 billion.\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects the company's non-GAAP earnings to grow at 39% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027). Compared to that estimate, its current valuation of 71.7 times adjusted earnings lands somewhere between cheap and expensive.\nArm designs central processing unit (CPU) architectures and development tools, and licenses the intellectual property (IP) to customers. Included among its clientele are the five largest companies in the world. Arm IP is the foundation for Apple's Private Cloud Compute, Nvidia's Grace CPUs, Microsoft's Cobalt chips, Alphabet's Axion CPUs, and Amazon's Graviton processors.\nThat lineup is particularly interesting because those chips are being used in data centers, a market historically dominated by Intel and AMD. To elaborate, Arm chips have traditionally been limited to mobile devices because x86 processors from Intel and AMD have offered superior computational performance. Companies on both sides of the architectural divide have attempted to take market share from the others, but Arm has been more successful.\nThe company has defended its dominance in smartphones and other mobile devices, while gaining share in data centers by improving its chips' processing power, especially where AI is concerned. That means Arm is well positioned to monetize AI on two fronts: personal devices like Apple's iPhones and Microsoft's Copilot+ PCs, as well as infrastructure and platform services offered by public cloud providers like Amazon and Alphabet.\nThe only problem with Arm is valuation. Wall Street expects the company to grow adjusted earnings at 25% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends March 2026). That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 96 times adjusted earnings look outrageously expensive.\nBroadcom provides IT solutions across two broad categories: infrastructure software and semiconductors. To elaborate, the company sells virtualization, mainframe, and cybersecurity software, which help businesses manage, optimize, and protect IT infrastructure. Of the three software verticals, virtualization is most central to the Broadcom growth narrative. Its subsidiary VMware is the leader in server virtualization, and the market is projected to grow at 18% annually through 2032.\nHowever, Broadcom's largest opportunities lie in semiconductor solutions because that segment will benefit from demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. Broadcom is the market leader in data center networking chips, and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Argus analysts Jim Kelleher recently wrote, \"The business most being impacted by AI is networking, where Broadcom has long-established market leadership in the enterprise and cloud data center.\" But that could change in the years ahead.\nBroadcom is also the market leader in high-end ASICs, custom silicon built for specialized use cases like artificial intelligence. The company already designs AI accelerators for Google and Meta Platforms, and it recently won a third major customer. Broadcom announced the deal in March without naming the client, but Reuters identified the company as TikTok parent ByteDance .\nToday, custom AI accelerators account for less than 10% of AI processors because the market is dominated by GPUs (Nvidia GPUs to be precise). But Morgan Stanley analysts believe custom AI chips sales will increase more quickly than GPU sales during the next few years, such that ASICs account for up to 30% of AI chips by 2027. In that scenario, Broadcom would likely be the biggest winner because it controls 55% to 60% of the market, according to analysts.\nWall Street expects the company's earnings to grow at 24% annually through 2025. That makes the current valuation of 38 times earnings look reasonable.

        "Text": "Updated at 9:53 AM EDT\nNvidia shares tumbled in early Monday trading, extending the stock's one-month decline to around 23%, amid a major pullback in global tech stocks and reports of a delay in the delivery of its newly designed AI chips known as Blackwell.\nNvidia\u00a0 (NVDA) , which unveiled the Blackwell line of processors earlier this year, has said the flagship chips\u00a0perform artificial-intelligence tasks at more than twice the speed of its current Hopper chips, while using less energy and providing more bespoke flexibility.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager who predicted stocks drop updates outlook\nThe tech giant said it would ramp production of the new processors over the second half of this year while continuing to sell its H100 Hopper series to hyperscaler clients such as Microsoft\u00a0 (MSFT) , Meta Platforms\u00a0 (META) \u00a0and Google parent Alphabet\u00a0 (GOOGL) .\nHyperscalers, the major providers of massive data-center and cloud services, are in fact are poised to spend around $500 billion over the next two years building out their massive infrastructure, according to estimates from Barclays. This investment will come as they leverage their massive datasets to enhance sales of everything from drive-through dining to the most complicated pharmaceutical testing.\nBloomberg/Getty Images\nTech-focused news outlet the Information, however, has reported that Nvidia had informed Microsoft, as well as an unnamed cloud-service provider client, that a design flaw had been found in the Blackwell architecture, which could delay its production ramp and delivery dates by around three months.\nAnalysts had expected Blackwell to generate revenue for Nvidia starting in the third quarter and find their way into global customer data centers by the final three months of the year.\nAI demand, as well as Nvidia's commanding market share, is predicted to drive the group's data-center revenue as high as $150 billion next year, powered largely by this year's Blackwell launch.\nRelated: Top analyst puts Nvidia stock on key list after $500 million slump\n\"With Blackwell said to be in full production in the second quarter, Nvidia is working to bring up its enterprise system and cloud partners for global availability later this year, with the ramp expected in Q3 and the company anticipating data centers should be operational by Q4,\" Benchmark analyst Cody Acree said in a note that followed Nvidia's second quarter earnings.\n\"Demand for H200 and Blackwell is well ahead of supply, and the company expects demand may exceed supply well into next year,\" he added.\nGoldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari, who reiterated his conviction-buy rating and $135 price price target on Nvidia stock following the weekend report, said he remained confident that Blackwell revenue would remain a major part of the group's near-term growth story.\n\"While (the report), if true, could drive some volatility in Nvidia\u2019s near-term fundamentals (i.e., muted growth in the October and/or January quarters followed by a steeper than previously expected ramp), we expect there to be little to no impact on calendar year 2025 earnings and, most importantly, the company\u2019s long-term competitive position,\" he said.\nNvidia, which reports fiscal-third-quarter earnings later this month, told investors in May that current-quarter revenue would rise to around $28 billion, a stronger-than-expected tally that assuaged investors concern about a so-called air pocket created by the Blackwell launch.\nMore AI Stocks:\nAnalyst adjusts Nvidia stock rating on valuation\nAnalyst revises Facebook parent stock price target in AI arms race\nGoogle falling behind climate goals thanks to AI ramp up\nSome investors had worried that customers would cancel orders for the older H100 chips and wait for the newer system processors to ship later in the year.\nRelated: Analyst puts Nvidia stock on watch; report points to new China chip\nNvidia shares were marked 7.4% lower in early Monday trading to change hands at $99.37 each.\nThat move, if it holds through the trading session, would drag the stock into bear market territory, which is typically defined as a 20% decline from a stock's recent peak.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.20 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 40 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.5% and 5% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>The ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date.

        "Text": "Thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been one of 2024's biggest winners. The company's share price has skyrocketed 155% across this year's trading alone, and continued momentum for sales and earnings could help push its valuation even higher.\nAs eye-catching as Nvidia's big gains in 2024 have been, its long-term performance is actually far more impressive. The company has shifted from primarily being a designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for video games to the leading provider of processors for data centers and AI. As a result, the tech pioneer has risen from a market capitalization of roughly $10.3 billion a decade ago to a market cap of more than $3.1 trillion today.\nNvidia stock has delivered a total return of more than 27,000% over the last decade. That means that if you invested $1,000 in the stock 10 years ago and held onto your position, your holdings would now be worth more than $271,000.\nNvidia's incredible success and performance for shareholders is a testament to the benefits of long-term investing. The market-crushing run also shows that it only takes a handful of big winners to power incredible gains for your portfolio.\nFor example, imagine you had invested $1,000 in nine other companies a decade ago in addition to investing the same amount in Nvidia. Even if each of those nine other stocks when to $0 per share, Nvidia's performance would have meant that you would have scored more than $261,000 in profits on your initial $10,000 investment.\nOf course, finding these kinds of massive winners is easier said than done -- but there are stocks on the market right now that could go on to be \"the next Nvidia.\" Even the hottest stocks aren't going to turn $1,000 into more than $271,000 overnight, but giving strong companies time to execute their growth strategies and seize new opportunities can be a path to life-changing wealth creation.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors have experienced some gut-wrenching volatility this year, and that will likely continue. After soaring as much as 174%, the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker plunged as much as 25% and now sits roughly 7% off its all-time high.\nThe company has a lot riding on the upcoming debut of its Blackwell processor, which promises to take AI to the next level. However, reports that the launch will be delayed have weighed on investor sentiment, holding the stock back.\nOne Wall Street veteran believes investors are missing the forest for the trees.\nOn Monday, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah reiterated his buy rating and $175 price target on Nvidia stock, which represents potential gains for investors of 38% compared to Monday's closing price. The analyst believes that while Blackwell B200/GB200 AI chips may be delayed, production of the current Hopper AI chips continues to accelerate, achieving greater throughput. As such, the increasing availability of the current Hopper processors -- which are considered the gold standard -- will more than make up for any potential Blackwell delays.\nThe analyst has a point. Earlier this month, Nvidia addressed the reports, saying, \"As we've stated before, Hopper demand is very strong, broad Blackwell sampling has started, and production is on track to ramp in [the second half of 2024]. Beyond that, we don't comment on rumors.\"\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia is scheduled to report the results of its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 30), and investors will be watching the proceedings with keen interest. Management is guiding for revenue of $28 billion, an increase of 107% year over year. Wall Street is even more bullish, with analysts' consensus estimates of $28.6 billion.\nTo be clear, at 46 times expected earnings, there's a lot of growth baked into Nvidia's current stock price. Management's outlook and comments regarding the broader state of AI adoption will likely be far more critical than the release date of a specific chip. I agree that Nvidia stock remains a buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Morgan Stanley's Highest Conviction Stocks: Top 20 Stocks To Buy.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Morgan Stanley's other high conviction stocks.\nWith the second half of 2024 having settled in, the broader economic environment that will determine the future course of the stock market is becoming clearer. While the surge in investor interest surrounding artificial intelligence stocks placed the macroeconomic picture in the background for a while, now, as the second quarter earnings season is nearly over, macroeconomics is coming back into play. Investors are eager to read the mind of Fed chairman Jerome Powell for future interest rate cut decisions and the crystal ball to see what way the economy is heading.\nOn this front, investment bank Morgan Stanley has been churning out quite a lot of reports to guide investors. One such report came out in July and shared the bank's key themes to focus on during the month. While July is over, this report contains key details that can provide information about what to expect for the rest of the year too. Two of the biggest takeaways from this report cover an economic soft landing and the potential for equities performance to widen.\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\nOn the former front, the bank shared that July \"bolstered the case for a soft landing as inflation has declined and a few major central banks cut rates.\" It believes that forward looking data suggests that \"wage growth should continue to slow in the U.S. and Eurozone\" which will eventually contribute to cooling inflation and eventually lower rates to increase the chances of a soft landing. In terms of data, the bank's estimates for 2025 suggest that year over year wage growth could sit at 3% in 2025 for a marked growth over the 2022 peak.\nBack then, wage growth percentages as indicated by Indeed postings and the Fed had stood at ~9.4% and ~6.5%, respectively. As an additional positive note, the bank also adds that the US is leading the EU and the UK because of its wage growth of 3% which is less than half of the UK's roughly 7%.\nOn the latter front, i.e., MS' belief that equities performance can widen, it shares that there \"is ample room for equities performance to broaden, but this requires a cyclical recovery.\" What this means is that big tech has accounted for most of the market's returns this year due to the AI hype, and this can spread out to smaller firms but only if the broader economy recovers. Underlying this belief is data for the flagship S&P index's price to earnings ratio, as the bank shares that the 12 month forward P/E \"runs at 21x on a cap-weighted basis but only 16x equal- weighted.\" This suggests that the smaller companies have room to catch up with the larger companies, but their performance will only improve if consumer and business spending flourishes during a cyclical uptrend.\nThis potential has led the bank to lament that \"we turned neutral too soon\" as it also cites forward earnings data to support the hypothesis of the bifurcation in valuation. For the Magnificent Seven stocks, the 12 month forward earnings rebased to 100 as of December 2023 sit at a whopping 120 while the estimate for the remaining 493 firms on the S&P index is ~106. However, before you get too optimistic, MS also cautions against investing in small cap stocks. It shares that small cap \"requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates, which seems unlikely in the current inflation environment.\" Plotting the returns of small caps with bond yields to signify a relationship with interest rates, its data shows that when bond yields were at 1%, small cap relative returns to large caps were 100%. But when the yields soared to ~5.6%, these returns dropped to ~82%.\nMS' August report builds on the July themes. It builds on the bearishness surrounding small caps, shifts the focus on the labor market over inflation, and brings real estate into the mix. Reducing wage growth allows the Fed to shift its focus from inflation \"to potential cracks in the labor market,\" says the bank, but it cautions that recession \"indicators such as the Sahm Rule are creeping toward a recessionary threshold based on the rising national unemployment rate.\" Its data shows that the 3 month national unemployment average is 0.5% over the previous 12 month low, which rings a warning bell, to say the least. Still bearish on small caps, it adds that while \"recent inflation data and the resulting decline in rates was a lift to small cap, softer economic data may constrain its continued outperformance.\"\nThere is some positivity in the August report, though. The bank shares that commercial real estate, which has been one of the hardest hit sectors from rising rates and shifting trends to remote working, now presents an \"emerging opportunity set.\" The analysts outline that commercial real estate valuations \"valuations have become more attractive in the face of higher interest rates and elevated supply,\" adding that they \"expect volumes to pick up this year due to upcoming debt maturities, reinforcing these lower entry points.\" Counterintuitively, this optimism is based on depressed valuations as it uses the commercial real estate cap rate. As per MS' data, this rate sat at 9% in March 2024, for nearly a two percentage point lead over retail real estate and a wider three point lead over residential real estate. The bank is also quite impressed with hedge fund performance in 2024 as it commented that the funds \"delivered attractive risk-adjusted performance in the first half of 2024 and their positioning suggests confidence in the opportunities for skill-based returns.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of MS' top stocks, we used its latest 20 top conviction stock ideas and ranked them by the average percentage share price upside to the bank's own share price targets.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nShare Price Upside: 16%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a GPU designer whose products cover enterprise and consumer use cases. Its largest business division is the data center business which designs and sells GPUs for artificial intelligence and other high performance computing workloads. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are the best performing in the industry, which means that it controls more than two thirds of the market. Access to leading edge chip manufacturing technologies and strict software control for customers of its GPUs through CUDA are key NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) competitive advantages. The firm's dominant market position means that there is a shortage of its products, which has allowed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to beef up its margins by raising prices. However, it has also incentivized competing products from the likes of AMD and Intel, and the firm could see its position weaken if Big Tech succeeds in making its own AI GPUs.\nArtisan Partners mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\"NVIDIA\u2019s year-to-date dollar value increase is $1.8 trillion. That\u2019s equivalent to the 2023 increase in US GDP, which is, of course, representative of the collective economic efforts of about 330 million people. NVIDIA\u2019s market cap is now $3 trillion. So is the GDP of France.\nOverall NVDA ranks 14th on our list of Morgan Stanley's highest conviction stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

These price targets are usually just an estimate of where an analyst thinks a stock can trade in the near term. Based on the firm's research, investors might be underestimating Nvidia's earnings growth potential over the next few years.\nUBS believes that early shipments for Blackwell could be delayed to the end of January. However, it shouldn't hurt Nvidia's revenue in the near term, since it can sell more H200 graphics processing units (GPUs) to customers using them for artificial intelligence (AI) until Blackwell is available.\nThe firm sees strong commitments from AI researchers and growing demand from enterprises as a positive indicator for Nvidia's business. Indeed, the growing demand for training computers with AI is not slowing down. AI models are not as sophisticated as they will be in 10 years, and the growing demand for AI training in the data center is the biggest driver of Nvidia's revenue growth.\nStill, if Nvidia confirms a delay of Blackwell in its next earnings report on Aug. 28, it could limit the stock's gains and even cause a temporary sell-off, since it would introduce a new uncertainty to Nvidia's business outlook.\nUBS' price target implies 27% upside from the current $118 share price, which would stretch Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings multiple to an expensive 54. At these lofty share prices, Wall Street traders will be looking for any excuse to take a profit and sell no matter how great Nvidia's long-term growth prospects look right now.\nGiven the potential for negative news to impact Nvidia's share price in the near term, it doesn't hurt to wait to buy the stock until after the upcoming earnings report.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The firm makes the most advanced artificial intelligence chips in the market, and is considered as a bellwether for AI demand.\nNvidia\u2019s earnings also come after reports from a slew of other tech majors suggested that AI may not be as big an earnings driver as initially thought- a notion that had triggered sharp losses in tech valuations over the past month.\nBut despite some uncertainty over Nvidia and a rotation out of technology, Wall Street indexes were buoyed by expectations of lower interest rates, especially after Fed officials struck a dovish tone in recent addresses.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.2% and ended at a record-high close of 5,625.80 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up to a record-high finish of 41,250.50 points on Tuesday.

Photo: Reuters>\nDespite compromised computing capabilities, the B20 will compensate with improved interconnection bandwidth, which allows binding multiple cards together to make up for the lower computing power of a single GPU, according to the people.\nNvidia, for which China was the third-largest market in the financial year ended January 28, is one of the most prominent tech firms bearing the brunt of increasingly stringent US sanctions on China's access to advanced semiconductors. Nvidia was barred from selling its A100 and H100 GPUs - two of the most in-demand chips for training and running artificial intelligence (AI) models - to China in August 2022. It later modified those chips to create the A800 and H800 to get around those restrictions, but they were also barred from export to China last October.\nUS Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo warned chip companies last year to stop trying to design around export rules, saying she would control the new chips \"the very next day\".\nNvidia, however, has come under increasing competitive pressure in China from domestic chip makers enjoying a government push for technological self reliance, such as Huawei Technologies. This has led Nvidia to develop the H20, L20 and L2 GPUs in a fight to maintain its market share in the country.\nDemand for those chips was initially tepid, but sales of the H20 - the most powerful of the batch - have grown in recent months. While some companies continue to buy smaller quantities of Nvidia's more powerful GPUs on the black market, buying officially available chips gives them access to critical maintenance services needed for long-term support, according to the sources, who have met with Chinese Nvidia clients.\nA Nvidia chip is displayed at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Shanghai, June 26, 2024.

Dylan Patel, chief analyst at SemiAnalysis, said Nvidia's H20 still offers better performance than Huawei's 910B, the Chinese tech giant's leading AI chip.\nThe B200, Nvidia's latest computing platform for AI workloads, offers computing power of up to 20 petaflops from 208 billion transistors. The Blackwell platform, including the B100, B200 and GB200 superchip, is expected to see production ramp up in the fourth quarter, while still accounting for less than 10 per cent of the total high-end GPU market, research firm TrendForce estimates.\nNvidia is also planning to launch a server called GB20 for the China market, according to a report from US tech news outlet The Information, citing unnamed sources. Apart from incorporating several B20 chips, the GB20 server includes central processing units (CPUs). The design is similar to that of the GB200-based server, which combines many B200 chips and its Arm-based Grace CPUs.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

They remain optimistic that the B100/B200 products will ramp up later this year, followed by the GB200 NVL systems in the first half of 2025.\nStill, analysts acknowledge that AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) could benefit from the situation or at least attract incremental customer interest, particularly given the MI300X\u2019s memory capacity advantage over Nvidia\u2019s H200.\nNvidia stock fell nearly 10% in Monday\u2019s premarket trading amid a global stock-market sell-off driven by growing fears that the U.S. economy may be headed for a recession.\nRelated Articles\nNvidia: Analysts see potential Blackwell delay impact as modest\nNvidia stock tumbles 10% in premarket amid global stock market rout\nStocks trampled, Nikkei tumbles past Black Monday milestone\n"

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now",
        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "AI chip leader and stock market darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has rapidly shed over 20% since becoming the world's most valuable company just weeks ago. Investors should think twice before rushing to buy the dip. Nvidia's stock appreciated to breathtaking heights and the company's once-presumed dominance of the AI chip market is now less certain.\nNvidia enjoyed rampant growth these past 18 months but relied on a small handful of customers for it.\nNews recently came that tech giant Apple, which will soon roll out AI tech for iOS devices, trained its AI models on Alphabet's AI chips instead of Nvidia's. It's a crack in the idea that Nvidia, which owned as much as 90% of the AI chip market, would continue to dominate without meaningful pressure from competition.\nInvestors may be better off letting more air out of Nvidia and circling back after its upcoming Q2 earnings give a glimpse into the business's performance.\nInstead, consider these two high-quality companies using AI to enhance their existing products. Their growth comes at solid prices, setting the stage for great long-term investment returns.\nSalesforce (NYSE: CRM) is no stranger to the technology sector. The company was a pioneer in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model. It sells the world's leading customer relationship manager (CRM) software but has vastly expanded over the years to form a software ecosystem packed with tools for running virtually all aspects of a company. Salesforce has been public since 2004 but remains a growing company today; the company's business segments, sales, service, platform/other, and integration/analytics all posted double-digit year-over-year growth in Q1.\nOver 150,000 companies use Salesforce worldwide, rich soil for growth via product cross-selling. Today, most revenue growth comes from expanding business with existing customers. As companies use more Salesforce products, it makes it harder to switch. Salesforce isn't an AI-driven business, but it uses AI to enhance its products. The company launched its Einstein 1 Platform, an AI product that enables customers to use AI across Salesforce's software ecosystem. Einstein can automate processes, deploy generative AI features, analyze and streamline data, and more. Ideally, Einstein will maximize the experience using Salesforce software, which ultimately makes customers less likely to leave and more likely to spend more.\nThere are signs that Salesforce is a maturing company; management began share repurchases a couple of years ago and initiated a dividend earlier this year. That signals to Wall Street that Salesforce makes more profits than it needs and can't think of a better way to spend them than simply returning them to shareholders. Analysts have also lowered their long-term earnings growth estimates over the past year:\nAlthough the stock doesn't look as cheap, given lowered growth expectations, its PEG ratio of 1.4 is still reasonable for long-term investors. Anticipation is building for interest rate cuts, which could plant seeds for increased growth in the technology sector over the coming years. Salesforce could realistically outperform current expectations, making the stock look cheap in hindsight. When it comes to proven winners like Salesforce, it can pay not to get too cute.\nUiPath (NYSE: PATH) has taken its lumps. The stock has fallen 85% from its former high, and its most recent quarter was disastrous, with the CEO abruptly resigning. Co-founder and former CEO Daniel Dines has reassumed the role for now. UiPath specializes in business automation software that learns and replicates repetitive computer tasks. It's the type of story about machines replacing humans you don't see in the movies. UiPath's technology has routinely garnished leadership status from third-party testing like Gartner's prestigious Magic Quadrant system.\nHowever, UiPath is clearly experiencing some challenges. The company's Q1 earnings included layoff announcements and a scaling back of its annual recurring revenue guidance from $1.725 billion to $1.730 to $1.660 billion to $1.665 for its fiscal year 2025. Management cited several excuses, including economic conditions, deal scrutiny, and the leadership change. It smells like the company didn't execute well under CEO Rob Enslin, who had been Co-CEO since 2022 but the sole CEO for only a few months.\nDaniel Dines has served in the CEO/Co-CEO role since 2005, so his return has seemingly restored analysts' confidence. Long-term earnings growth estimates plummeted after Q1 but have virtually rebounded to where they were entering the year:\nHowever, the stock has not come back. Today shares trade at a forward P/E ratio of 32, which would make it a jaw-dropping bargain if UiPath delivers earnings growth on par with estimates. Annualized 40% earnings growth is a tall task, and UiPath must still prove it's back on track. But investors who believe in the former CEO's leadership could be staring at a rare buying opportunity today.\nBefore you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Salesforce wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Evercore ISI analysts advised investors to buy Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock ahead of the chipmaker\u2019s earnings report for the July quarter, stressing that recent concerns over Blackwell delays are \u201coverdone.\u201d\nThe investment bank notes that demand for Nvidia systems remains strong, citing a 20% quarter-on-quarter surge in hyperscale capital expenditure (CapEx) in Q2 2024. Looking ahead, CapEx is expected to grow a further 8% and 10% in Q3 and Q4, respectively.\nEarlier this month, reports suggested that Nvidia\u2019s much-anticipated Blackwell system, which includes its next-generation AI chips, could face a delay of up to three months. The news raised investors' concerns about the sustainability of NVIDIA's stock's upward trajectory and was a contributing factor to the recent sell-off.\nAfter analyzing three previous instances of Nvidia product disruptions in 2008, 2022, and 2023, Evercore analysts conclude that while a negative announcement could lead to a short-term 5%-to-10% drop in the stock, NVDA has consistently demonstrated its ability to swiftly develop alternative solutions.\n\u201cFurthermore, should a delay manifest, we believe demand is so strong, particularly at Tier 2 and 3 CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) and enterprises, that current generation Hopper solutions would be purchased even if Blackwell was pushed,\u201d analysts noted.\nMoreover, they observe that Nvidia shares have experienced two significant corrections, each over 50%, in recent history: one in the second half of 2018, occurring one quarter before peak capital expenditure (CapEx) when the stock was trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 38, and another in 2021-22, four quarters before peak CapEx, starting with a P/E of 67.\nWith peak CapEx forecasted for the fourth quarter of 2025 and NVIDIA's current P/E at 39, the analysts do not anticipate a significant sell-off in the stock before mid-2025.\nOverall, Evercore\u2019s team continues to view NVDA as its \u201cTop Tectonic Shift in Computing pick,\u201d positioned to capture up to 80% of the value created in the parallel processing era.\nAnalysts believe the AI darling could accumulate more than $10 of earnings per share (EPS) power by 2030 \u201cand that it could ultimately grow to be 10-15% weighting of the S&P 500 Index.\u201d\nNear-term, Evercore raises its third-quarter and 2024 estimates for Nvidia and lift its target price on the stock from $145 to $150.\nRelated Articles\nBlackwell concerns 'overdone', buy Nvidia stock into earnings: Evercore\nVolkswagen's battery targets not 'set in stone', battery chief tells FAS\nSociete Generale drops ring-dealing membership of LME\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia earnings and California\u2019s landmark AI bill have the AI industry holding its breath",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Kahn ",
        "Text": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI.\nAnticipation. That\u2019s the title of a great old Carly Simon song. And that's the vibe of today\u2019s newsletter. There\u2019s a lot of hotly awaited AI news this week.\nMarkets will be watching Nvidia\u2019s earnings announcement tomorrow to gauge the health of the AI boom. According to news reports, the company is expected to say that quarterly sales have more than doubled, even though the year-on-year revenue growth rate has slowed. Investors will be particularly keen to learn if rumors are true that the company\u2019s next-generation Blackwell AI chip will be delayed due to supply chain issues, and if so, how lengthy the delays will be and how that will impact Nvidia\u2019s revenue forecasts.\nWith Nvidia\u2019s stock having largely recovered from late July\u2019s big sell-off and now trading back close to record highs, there could be serious stock market trouble if Nvidia announces significant lags in Blackwell shipments or if there are other negative surprises in the company\u2019s earnings. Because Nvidia is now seen as a bellwether for the entire AI boom\u2014skeptics would say \u201cbubble\u201d\u2014the fallout could spread well beyond Nvidia to other Magnificent Seven stocks and perhaps the wider S&P 500, of which Nvidia now constitutes 6.5% due to its $3.1 trillion market cap.\nThe other eagerly anticipated AI news of the week is the fate of California\u2019s proposed AI regulation, SB 1047, which is expected to come to a vote in the State Assembly sometime this week. The bill is designed to try to head off any catastrophic risks from the largest, most powerful AI models\u2014those that would cost more than $100 million to train\u2014but has proved controversial as my Fortune colleagues Sharon Goldman chronicled last month and Jenn Brice laid out in short explainer we published yesterday. AI\u2019s biggest names have lined up on opposite sides of the debate. AI godfathers Geoff Hinton and Yoshua Bengio support the bill as \u201ca positive and reasonable step,\u201d while fellow Turing Award winner Yann LeCun opposes it as likely to stifle innovation, as do AI pioneers Andrew Ng and Fei-Fei Li. Elon Musk has come out in support, while most of Silicon Valley\u2019s leading venture capital firms and top AI companies such as OpenAI and Microsoft, as well as Google and Meta, are against.\nThanks to lobbying by technology companies, the bill that the California Assembly will vote on has already been watered down significantly from its earlier versions. As originally proposed by State Sen. Scott Wiener, the bill would have created a legal duty of care on the part of AI developers to ensure their models do not result in what the bill calls \u201ccritical harms\u201d\u2014a term it defines as causing a chemical, biological, or nuclear attack that resulted in mass casualties, autonomously killing a lot of people in some other way, autonomously committing felonies that resulted in $500 million in damage, or creating a cyberattack that caused that amount of damage. Tech companies building AI systems would have been required to institute safety procedures to prevent AI systems from causing these harms and to prevent anyone from modifying them after they\u2019d been trained so that the models might cause these harms. Model developers would also have to retain the ability to fully shut down a model if it could cause serious problems. A new state agency would have been set up to ensure compliance with the law and California's attorney general would have been able to sue companies for negligence if the agency determined the correct protocols were not being followed, even before a model was trained and deployed.\nThe version that is coming to a vote this week no longer establishes the new state AI regulator and no longer lets the AG act in advance of any actual incident. Instead, the Attorney General\u2019s office will take on much of the compliance monitoring role that the AI agency was to have performed in the original version. AI developers will have to hire an outside auditing firm to ensure compliance and this firm will submit reports annually to the AG\u2019s office. But law enforcement can only sue the AI developers for liability after a catastrophic incident has occurred.\nStill, if SB 1047 passes it will be a watershed moment for AI regulation in the U.S., which has so far lagged the European Union\u2014as well as China\u2014in passing laws governing the training and use of AI. In the absence of Congress passing any AI laws\u2014something which won\u2019t happen until well after the next election\u2014the California law may become a de facto national standard due to the presence of so many tech companies in the state.\nIf nothing else, the debate over the bill has been clarifying. As an article in the liberal political journal The Nation noted, SB 1047 has been a \u201cmask-off moment\u201d for the AI industry. It is ironic\u2014and telling\u2014to see companies such as OpenAI, whose CEO Sam Altman went before Congress and practically begged for AI regulation, or Microsoft, which has proposed AI model developers institute extensive know-your-customer requirements that are not dissimilar to those contained in SB 1047, line up to oppose the bill. If we ever thought maybe these guys were sincere when they said publicly that they wanted to be regulated, now we know the truth. We should never have given them the benefit of the doubt.\nIt's perhaps revelations such as this that have disillusioned many of those working on AI safety inside top AI companies. It turns out that a large portion of the AI safety researchers at OpenAI have departed the company in recent months, according to reporting from my fellow Fortune AI reporter Sharon.\nWhether we believe that AI models powerful enough to cause significant, large-scale harm are close at hand, the departure of these researchers should trouble us because of what it may say about how cautious and safety-minded OpenAI and other companies are being about the models they are releasing currently. To date, some of the best methods to limit near-term risks from AI models\u2014such as their ability to spew toxic language or recommend users\u2019 self-harm\u2014have come from AI safety researchers thinking about how to control future superpowerful AI.\nAs for regulation, I'm generally in favor of steps that would ensure AI doesn\u2019t cause significant harm. But I don\u2019t think state-by-state regulation makes much sense. Instead, we urgently need national rules and, probably, a national AI regulator similar to the state-level one originally proposed in the California bill. But we\u2019ll see if we wind up getting one.\nJeremy Kahnjeremy.kahn@fortune.com@jeremyakahn\nBefore we get to the news.

        "Title": "Why Is Nvidia Stock Still a Buy After Its Steep Sell-Off? Just Ask Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta.",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) luster seems to have faded. The stock is down roughly 25% below its high set only a few weeks ago. Roughly one-third of Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG in August no longer recommend buying Nvidia stock, a big change from July.\nSome investors might think it's time to move on to greener pastures. I suspect the opposite is true. Why is Nvidia still a buy after its steep sell-off? Just ask Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META).\nAll four artificial intelligence (AI) leaders sang the same song in their latest quarterly updates. And their music should be sweet to the ears of Nvidia shareholders.\nAlphabet reported its second-quarter results on July 23. CFO Ruth Porat noted in the Q2 earnings call that the company's capital expenditures were \"driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers, followed by data centers.\" She added that capex in subsequent quarters this year would be at or above the Q1 level of $12 billion.\nCEO Sundar Pichai was asked about the high levels of AI infrastructure investment. He replied, \"[T]he risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here, even in scenarios where it turns out that we are over-investing.\"\nMicrosoft announced its fiscal 2024 Q4 results on July 30. CFO Amy Hood said in the company's earnings call, \"To meet the growing demand signal for our AI and cloud projects, we will scale our infrastructure investments with FY '25 capital expenditures expected to be higher than FY '24.\" Around half of that spending will be on servers to support cloud and AI models.\nThe next day, Meta provided its Q2 update. CFO Susan Li stated in the Q2 call, \"[W]e currently expect significant capex growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.\"\nAmazon followed with its Q2 results on Aug. 1. In the company's earnings call, CFO Brian Olsavsky said, \"[W]e expect capital investments to be higher in the second half of the year.\" He added, \"The majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads.\"\nAlphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon plan to continue spending heavily on AI-related infrastructure. That's great news for Nvidia because it almost certainly means higher sales of its graphics processing units (GPUs).\nSure, these big companies are using their own AI chips to some extent. Google has its Trillium custom AI accelerator. Microsoft has Azure Maia. Meta's custom AI chip is MTIA (which stands for Meta Training and Inference Accelerator). Amazon played up its Trainium and Inferentia chips in its Q2 call.\nHowever, make no mistake about it: These AI giants rely heavily on Nvidia. That isn't going to change anytime soon. It's possible the dependence on Nvidia could increase soon. Nvidia's Blackwell GPU architecture is leaps and bounds better than anything else on the market. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta are lined up to be among the first to receive the new Blackwell-based chips when they begin shipping.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has great expectations for Blackwell. He predicts that it could be the \"most successful product\" in the company's history. I suspect he'll be proven right -- with Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta helping make it happen.\nSome investors could be concerned about the report in The Information of a delay in shipping Blackwell chips due to a design flaw. Nvidia hasn't commented on the rumor other than to confirm that it expects production of the new chips to ramp up in the second half of 2024.\nI'm not sure if the report is true, although it could be. In Nvidia's quarterly update in May, CFO Colette Kress said the company was working to make Blackwell available for global partners \"later this year.\" However, in Alphabet's Q2 call, Pichai noted that \"the latest Nvidia Blackwell platform will be coming to Google Cloud in early 2025.\"\nBut any Blackwell delay should only be a temporary issue for Nvidia. The overall prospects for the company shouldn't change. And if you listen closely to what Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta are saying, those prospects should remain very good.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia trumped analyst expectations for its second fiscal quarter, and CEO Jensen Huang said the company would continue its strong performance thanks to the world-changing capabilities of AI.\nThe company has profited handsomely from an AI craze that has seen tech giants\u00a0pour billions of dollars into Nvidia chips to help power large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini. But doubts remain as to whether these companies are actually making money on AI, and whether they can continue their frenzied pace of spending.\nWhen Huang was asked on the company\u2019s earnings call Wednesday about the sustainability of customer spending, he raved about AI\u2019s ability to transform computing, but danced around the question.\nFor eight minutes, Huang talked about how the usual CPUs that are standard the world over are reaching peak capacity, talked up the wonders of accelerated computing powered by the GPUs that are Nvidia\u2019s bread and butter, and mentioned that even sovereign countries are getting into the AI game.\n\u201cYou can see that there's just so many different directions that generative AI is going, and so we're actually seeing the momentum of generative AI accelerate,\u201d he said.\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment to Fortune.\nThe AI tools that are already out there\u2014ChatGPT, AI image generators, and coding assistants\u2014are just the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface are future mainstream applications like extremely targeted ads, recommender systems that predict future wants and needs, and improved search engines, among other things, he added.\nBut analysts weren\u2019t satisfied with Huang\u2019s answer, and the subject of its customers' spending was brought up once again. This time, Huang didn\u2019t mince words.\n\u201cThe people who are investing in Nvidia infrastructure are getting returns on it right away. It's the best ROI infrastructure, computing infrastructure, investment you can make today,\u201d he said.\nWhen data center customers\u2014which make up about $26 billion of the company\u2019s $30 billion revenue\u2014already have a trillion dollars tied up in general-purpose computing infrastructure that in Nvidia\u2019s view represents the past, why would they want to build more? Huang asked.\n\u201cFor every billion dollars with a general-purpose CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent it for less than a billion, and so, because it's commoditized,\u201d he said.\nData centers that build using Nvidia\u2019s chips for accelerated computing, on the other hand, save money and see increased demand from the growing crop of startups creating the \u201cnext frontier\u201d of AI, Huang reasoned.\n\u201cThe world of general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative-AI software,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIf you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers\u2014build it with accelerated computing Nvidia. That's the best way to do it.\u201d\nAs of Wednesday Nvidia was the second-most valuable company in the world, with its $3.09 trillion market cap second only to Apple's. The company reported $30 billion in revenue, two times higher than its revenue in the same quarter last year. Its profit of $16.6 billion was also more than double that of a year ago, and the company said it expected revenue of $32.5 billion for the current quarter, above the $31.9 billion analysts expected.\nDespite Huang\u2019s optimistic words, Nvidia\u2019s shares fell just under 6% in after-hours trading Wednesday.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\nTop 5 Upgrades: \nNew Street upgraded Nvidia (NVDA) to Buy from Neutral with a $120 price target. Since the peak seen in June, Nvidia's stock has pulled back by 26%, underperforming most other semiconductor stocks exposed to datacenter AI, notes the analyst. While the firm finds the correction \"healthy overall\" and recognizes some limited and tactical headwinds specific to Nvidia, it views the pullback as \"an opportunity to gain more exposure,\" the analyst tells investors.\nPiper Sandler upgraded Crowdstrike (CRWD) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $290, down from $310. While the scale of the Crowdstrike-caused outage is unprecedented, historically, outages and breaches have had modest impacts on cyber business fundamentals, the firm says.\nPiper Sandler upgraded Cadence Design (CDNS) to Overweight from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $318. The recent selloff presents an attractive entry point \"in a premier software asset with an enviable position in the semi-industry,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\nBofA upgraded Apollo Global (APO) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $123, down from $124. The firm says the Apollo long trade is now a lot less crowded among hedge funds, and sees two catalysts for the stock, namely the October 2 investor day and potential S&P 500 Index addition.\nDA Davidson upgraded Criteo (CRTO) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $58, up from $43.

However, Barclays cautions that \"anything less than another beat and raise\" in Nvidia's upcoming report \"may prove to be a disappointment, with wider implications for the overall market.\"\nIn parallel, Barclays is closely monitoring Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole.\nThe speech is expected to \"fine-tune policy expectations\" as the market has already priced in a dovish stance from the Fed.\nThe bank notes that with four rate cuts being priced by OIS swaps before year end, the speech may not drastically alter the current market outlook, but it could influence short-term movements in rates and equities.\nBarclays notes that while \"the direction of travel is towards easier Fed policy,\" much of this dovish sentiment is already reflected in current market prices.\nAs such, the Jackson Hole event, coupled with Nvidia's earnings, could be pivotal in determining whether the market continues its current trajectory or faces a period of reassessment.\nRelated Articles\nNvidia earnings seen as more important than Powell's Jackson Hole speech: Barclays\nExclusive-WHO says partners can start talks to buy mpox vaccines before their approval\nWhat job RFK might get in a potential Trump Administration?\n"

        "Title": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Will Soar After Aug. 28 Because of These 3 Key Factors",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) steep sell-off has nearly run its course. The stock plunged 23.5% at one point, causing considerable angst for some investors. However, Nvidia has been on a roll in August, jumping almost 25%.\nThis momentum will end anytime soon, in my view. Instead, I predict that Nvidia stock will soar after Aug. 28. And I think the surge will be due to three key factors.\nIn Nvidia's fiscal 2025 first quarter, the company said it expected Q2 revenue of \"$28.0 billion, plus or minus 2%.\" Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG believe Nvidia sandbagged a little. Their average Q2 revenue estimate is $28.6 billion.\nI predict Nvidia will beat its own Q2 outlook and top Wall Street's expectations when it announces its results on Aug. 28. I also think this will flow down to the bottom line, with the company exceeding the average analysts' adjusted earnings estimate of $0.64 per share.\nWhy am I so optimistic? Both Nvidia and Wall Street have been too pessimistic about the demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs).\nIn Nvidia's fiscal 2024 Q4 update, management projected fiscal 2025 Q1 revenue of $24 billion, again giving a \"plus or minus 2%\" caveat. The company's actual Q1 revenue was $26 billion -- 8.3% higher than its outlook. Nvidia beat the consensus Q1 earnings estimate by 9.8%. I won't be surprised if there are similar outcomes in the company's Q2 results.\nOn a related note, I look for Nvidia to once again provide stellar guidance for the next quarter in its Q2 update. I'm even more confident about this prediction than I am that the company will deliver blowout Q2 numbers.\nFour reasons explain my boldness: Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. All of these huge Nvidia customers indicated in their latest quarterly updates that their capital expenditures will likely increase in the coming quarters to expand their artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\nOne comment especially stood out to me in the tech giants' recent earnings calls. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said, \"[T]he risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here.\" That should be music to the ears of Nvidia shareholders. And if Alphabet sees this risk of under-investing, you can bet that Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta do too.\nPerhaps the darkest cloud hovering over Nvidia in recent weeks is the concern that the company's launch of its new Blackwell GPUs will be significantly delayed. Any pushback in shipping these new chips will mean Nvidia's revenue won't grow as quickly as originally expected.\nI think the biggest issue for investors here is the sheer uncertainty. Some could be afraid of a much more serious delay than has been speculated so far. But the cure for uncertainty is clarity, something I expect Nvidia will provide in its Q2 conference call.\nAm I predicting there won't be any delay in shipping Blackwell chips? No. However, I suspect that Nvidia will seek to calm concerns to the best of its ability (and probably hint a lot about the pent-up demand for the new architecture). Once investors digest the news (whatever it might be), they'll quickly adjust their expectations. Most importantly, any delay will only be temporary.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Earnings season is nearing its end, with the vast majority of S&P 500 members already delivering quarterly results. The Q2 cycle has overall been resilient, underpinned by a strong showing from Tech, with the same expected for the current period (Q3).\nStill, we\u2019ve got the most important release of the Q2 cycle on deck for next week, which is coming from none other than AI favorite Nvidia NVDA.\nWe\u2019ve all become accustomed to the company\u2019s remarkable story, with shares gaining an incredible +170% over the last year on the back of record-setting Data Center results.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLet\u2019s take a deeper dive into the most highly-awaited release of the Q2 cycle and see if the stock is still worth a buy.\n\u00a0\nHeadline expectations for Nvidia haven\u2019t seen much action over recent months, with analysts keeping their estimates stable. This is a different development relative to other recent periods, as the stock previously enjoyed positive revisions leading up to other recent releases.\nStill, another period of robust growth is expected, with consensus expectations alluding to a 130% pop in earnings on 110% higher sales.\nThe $28.2 billion expected would pencil in the fifth consecutive period of triple-digit percentage Y/Y sales growth rates. Below is a visual breakdown of the company\u2019s sales, showing that the data center has quickly become its most lucrative segment.\nImage Source: NVIDIA \n\u00a0\nThe company\u2019s breakneck sales growth has been led by unbelievable Data Center results, which have consistently shattered records for the company in recent releases. For a quick refresher, the company\u2019s Data Center results include the sales of its AI chips.\nBelow is a visual illustrating the company\u2019s Data Center results relative to our consensus expectations in recent periods. As you can see, the beats have been overwhelmingly strong over recent periods, with the most recent beat totaling a sizable $1.9 billion.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor the quarter to be released, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Data Center results stands at $24.6 billion, 140% higher than the year-ago mark of $10.3 billion. Still, it\u2019s critical to note that there have been reports of delays for its chips based on Blackwell architecture, which could negatively affect coming periods if the delays remain longer than expected.\nThe Blackwell architecture reflects a serious upgrade, delivering up to 4X faster training and 30X faster inference than the H100. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla and xAI are among the many organizations expected to adopt Blackwell.\nDemand for Hopper and Blackwell GPUs remains rock-solid and well ahead of supply, with the supply/demand mismatch trend expected to continue well into 2025. We\u2019ll likely hear further color concerning the supply constraints in the release, particularly concerning reported delays for Blackwell.\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company's Data Center results on a quarterly basis.\nImage Source: NVIDIA\n\u00a0\nGiven the stock\u2019s massive run, many have become wary of the valuation picture. Shares presently trade at a 40.2X forward 12-month earnings multiple compared to a five-year high of 106.3X and a five-year median of 50.7X.\nRelative to the general market, current valuation levels reflect a considerable premium, with the S&P 500 currently trading at a 21.5X forward 12-month earnings multiple.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFurther, the current PEG ratio works out to 1.1X, reflecting a bargain relative to a 2.6X five-year median and five-year highs of 5.5X. So, while the stock isn\u2019t cheap when compared to the general market, it\u2019s currently trading at a discount relative to its historical levels.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nInvestor and AI-favorite Nvidia NVDA undoubtedly reflects the most highly-awaited release of the Q2 cycle, with the company\u2019s growth story expected to continue in a big way. Here are five key points to keep in mind -\nEstimates have largely remained stable for the release, the opposite of what the stock has experienced in prior periods.\n\u00a0\nData Center expectations remain strong, with the company again expected to deliver triple-digit percentage year-over-year sales growth.\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll likely hear further color concerning Blackwell delays and demand, though the company has already previously recognized a supply/demand mismatch (for both Hopper and Blackwell GPUs) that\u2019s expected to continue well into 2025.\n\u00a0\nShares aren\u2019t expensive relative to historical levels but do reflect a big premium when compared to the S&P 500. Remarkable growth has helped keep valuation multiples down, with the current PEG ratio also reflective of a fair price for the forecasted growth.\n\u00a0\nShares are up 175% over the last year, with the stock moving into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in late July. A beat-and-raise quarter would usher in positive revisions, likely helping it find its way back into a favorable Zacks Rank.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock closed at $98.91 on Aug. 7, its lowest level since late May, before rallying the last several days.\nBelow, we take a closer look at Nvidia\u2019s chart and use technical analysis to dial in on key price levels likely to attract attention.\nAfter setting a record high on June 20, Nvidia shares retraced as much as 36% before finding support around two prior March peaks during the broad-based equities sell-off on Monday last week. Since then, the stock has staged a remarkable recovery to reclaim the 50-day moving average (MA) in yesterday's trading session.\nHowever, it\u2019s worth pointing out the reversal has occurred on below-average volume, indicating the move may be driven by retail investors rather than larger market participants.\nLooking ahead, investors should monitor several crucial price levels in Nvidia shares that will likely remain in focus.\nThe first sits at $116, around 6% below Thursday\u2019s close. This area could provide support during initial profit-taking near a horizontal line linking the May high with a countertrend peak that formed during the stock\u2019s impulsive move lower between mid-July and early August.\nA close below this level could see the shares revisit $97, the region bulls successfully defended during the Aug. 5 selling rout, which also closely aligns with two peaks in March that capped the strong trending move from January to early March.\nOngoing short-term price momentum could carry Nvidia shares to $136, where they would likely run into selling pressure near the June 18 record close and July swing high, especially if other technical indicators confirm overbought conditions at the same time.\nTo project a new price target above the stock's all-time high (ATH), we can use a bars pattern. We do this by extracting the trending move from April to June and applying it from this month\u2019s low, which predicts a target of around $152.\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share ended the daily session down 6.7%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nAfter posting big gains Wednesday, Nvidia stock initially looked poised to see another day of gains thanks to strong demand indicators following the publication of Meta Platforms' Q2 results and guidance. But macroeconomic concerns took center stage for the broader stock market, and the highlighting of related risk factors drove big sell-offs for the chip specialist.\nNvidia's pullback today comes on the heels of even bigger gains on Wednesday. Microsoft issued encouraging capital expenditures and AI investment guidance with its recent quarterly report. Advanced Micro Devices also published Q2 results that showed demand for data center processors was high.\nInvestors were also feeling bullish ahead of expectations that yesterday's Federal Reserve meeting would signal that an interest rate cut is coming in September. In response, Nvidia's market capitalization increased $330 billion on Wednesday \u2014 the biggest-ever daily gain for a company.\nThe rally almost looked poised to continue Thursday. Encouraging capex guidance and commentary from Meta Platforms gave Nvidia stock a boost in pre-market and early daily trading, but the gains faded as an uptick in bearish sentiment for the overall stock market took hold.\nWhile the Fed's July meeting signaled that the much-anticipated interest rate cut will likely arrive next month, some economists are seeing increased risk of recession due to a recent increase in jobless claims and other factors. The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones indexes fell roughly 1.4%, 2.3, and 1.2%, respectively.\nAfter Thursday's sell-off, Nvidia is trading at roughly 40 times this year's expected earnings and 22 times expected sales. Notably, the company's price-to-earnings ratio is less than two times the company's price-to-sales ratio, which reflects the stellar profit margins the business has been serving up lately. But it's still a high-risk, high-reward stock.\nAided by ongoing demand for AI technologies, Nvidia will likely continue to post strong sales and earnings growth for the rest of the year and in 2025 \u2014 but the outlook is a bit murkier further out. The company's business has historically been shaped by cyclical trends, and it's not entirely clear what stage we're at in the current artificial intelligence investment cycle, and what macro backdrop will emerge.\nOn the other hand, the long-term outlook for AI-related hardware and services demand remains incredibly promising.

In recent weeks, some have taken a step back, looking for further evidence the accelerating adoption of AI would continue.\nWith that as a backdrop, as of 1:08 p.m. ET on Tuesday, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) jumped 6.4%, foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) climbed 5.8%, semiconductor and AI specialist Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) rallied 4.5%, and chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) rose 3.9%.\nA check of all the usual sources -- earnings results, changes to analysts' ratings, and regulatory filings -- turned up little in the way of company-specific news that helped push these AI stocks higher (more on that in a moment). That said, there was one obvious catalyst that helped spark a relief rally for AI stocks.\nFellow AI specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) reported its financial results, which helped put to bed fears that AI adoption is slowing. In the second quarter, the company generated revenue of $678 million, up 27% year over year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.09. For context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $652 million and EPS of $0.08, so Palantir surpassed expectations on both counts.\nIn addition to the company's solid results, Palantir also increased its forecast, giving investors confidence AI still has room to run. Management now expects full-year revenue of $2.75 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, representing growth of 23%. The company cited the strong performance of its U.S. commercial business, as revenue of $159 million soared 55% year over year. Palantir now expects the segment to grow at least 47% for the year, up from its previous guidance for 45% growth issued just three months ago.\nIf that weren't enough, management commentary suggested there's more to come. CEO Alex Karp suggested the current wave of AI adoption represented \"an unprecedented opportunity.\"\nThere were also a couple of company-specific developments in the space, but the impact would best be described as mixed:\nAnalysts at New Street Research upgraded Nvidia stock to buy from neutral (hold), while simultaneously issuing a price target of $120. That represents potential upside for investors of 19% compared to the stock's closing price on Monday. The analysts cited the recent 26% correction, saying such pullbacks are \"healthy,\" presenting \"an opportunity to gain more exposure\" to the stock.\nOn the other side of the coin, noted activist investor Elliott Management said Nvidia is in a \"bubble,\" calling AI overhyped, according to a report in The Financial Times.\nLoop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah lowered his price target on Arm shares to $110, down from its previous level at $120, while maintaining a buy rating on the stock. He cited the company's in-line financial results in the June quarter and in-line guidance for the September quarter, though he believes the overall thesis is \"intact.\"\nWhile it's clear that all AI companies can't be painted with the same brush, Palantir's robust results show that businesses are continuing to migrate to the technology, suggesting the trend is ongoing.\nThe recent sell-off has moderated some valuations, but value investors continue to be put off, a view I would suggest is myopic. High-growth stocks, like those involving AI, generally command a higher multiple than average, so using other valuation metrics can be informative.\nFor example, Arm Holdings, Nvidia, Broadcom, and TSM are selling for 73 times, 39 times, 31 times, and 24 times forward earnings, respectively. For value-minded investors, TSM might be the only one worth buying, but this fails to account for the accelerating growth trajectory of these companies resulting from AI. Using the more appropriate forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which factors in that growth, each stock has a multiple of less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.\nFurthermore, the use of generative AI has only just begun, with the adoption curve potentially lasting years. The best strategy for investing in this type of groundbreaking technology is to buy the best AI-related companies you can find and hold on for the wild ride ahead.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 7, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.\nThe AI trade has cooled off in recent weeks, with many of the notable companies involved in the trade, including Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, facing adverse price action.\nThe recent pressure raises a valid question: Is the selling overdone? Let\u2019s take a closer look at each.\nNvidia is the last of the beloved Mag 7 group to report Q2 results, which are expected to hit the tape in late August. Recent quarterly results have been overwhelmingly positive, with earnings and sales continuing to melt higher amid unrelenting demand.\nNonetheless, the outlook for its current fiscal year hasn\u2019t changed at all, with the $2.69 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 73% over the last year and suggesting 105% Y/Y growth. Revenue revisions also remain highly favorable.\nEarnings and sales revisions for the upcoming release have also remained highly positive, with the company again expected to post immense growth. Concerning Data Center expectations, the Zacks Consensus estimate presently sits at $24.6 billion, surpassing last year\u2019s mark of $10.3 billion.\nData Center results have regularly blown away our consensus estimates, with the most recent beat totaling a sizable $1.8 billion.\nWhile the stock has faced pressure, it certainly does not reflect the robust fundamentals beneath the hood. The stock remains at the heart of the AI trade, undoubtedly a prime selection for anybody seeking exposure.\nIn addition, breakneck growth has kept valuation multiples at historically sound levels, with the current 32.9X forward 12-month earnings multiple below the 50.7X five-year median and five-year highs of 106.3X.\nKeep in mind that shares traded well above current valuation levels in 2020 and 2021, a time when the AI theme had yet to emerge fully. Further, the current PEG ratio works out to a historically low 0.9X, reflecting that investors aren\u2019t overpaying for the forecasted growth.\nAdvanced Micro Devices recently released its latest quarterly results, exceeding both Zacks Consensus EPS and sales expectations.\nMost importantly, the company\u2019s AI outlook remains notably bright. CEO Lisa Su stated, \u2018Our AI business continued accelerating and we are well positioned to deliver strong revenue growth in the second half of the year led by demand for Instinct, EPYC and Ryzen processors. The rapid advances in generative AI are driving demand for more compute in every market, creating significant growth opportunities as we deliver leadership AI solutions across our business.\u2019\nAMD\u2019s Data Center sales of $2.8 billion reflected a quarterly record, climbing an astonishing 115% from the same period last year. As shown below, the company has chained together back-to-back beats on the metric, snapping a streak of negativity.\nStill, it\u2019s critical to note that AMD saw negative revisions for its current fiscal year hit the tape following the release, with the now $3.35 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting 26% year-over-year growth. Expectations have been trending lower overall over the last year.\nLike NVDA, valuation multiples aren\u2019t stretched, with the current 1.1X PEG ratio also reflecting a fair price for the forecasted growth.\nWhile both Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have faced pressure over the near term, their quarterly results and demand being experienced paint a highly positive picture for long-term gains.\nAs shown above, these stocks' respective PEG ratios reflect a fair price, shifting the valuation question out of the picture. Simply put, the recent selling has certainly been spooky, but it does not change their current stories. \nBoth remain prime buys for those seeking AI exposure, but Nvidia\u2019s more positive earnings outlook does put it above Advanced Micro Devices from a near-term perspective.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Good Ethical Company to Invest In?",
        "Author": "  Affan Mir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Ethical Companies To Invest In According to Reddit.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other ethical companies to invest in.\nEthical investing involves choosing investments based on ethical principles, such as environmental, religious, or social values. Unlike socially conscious investing, which follows a specific set of guidelines, ethical investing is more individualized. Investors typically avoid being involved in gambling, alcohol, or firearms, and carefully research to make sure their investments align with their values.\nOther stocks that are avoided by ethical investors include the shares of companies where employees are mistreated, have high gender parity, or discriminate against employees due to their race, religion, or sexual orientation. Environmentally conscious companies are also a huge part of ethical investing.\nA 2022 report by Stamford University noted that the younger generation considers ethical investing quite crucial. A 2022 survey of 2,470 individual investors, conducted by Stanford University's Rock Center for Corporate Governance, found significant differences in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) preferences based on age and wealth. Younger and wealthier investors are more likely to support ESG initiatives, even at the expense of returns, while older and less wealthy investors are generally opposed.\nOver recent years, support for ESG proposals has surged, with average support among S&P 500 companies increasing from 18% in 2012 to 35% in 2021, and the number of proposals passed rising from 0 to 28. The survey found that 70% of young investors (18-41 years old) are very concerned about environmental issues, compared to only 35% of older investors (58+ years old). Similarly, 65% of young investors are very concerned about social issues, versus 30% of older investors. When it comes to governance, 64% of younger investors express significant concern, while only 28% of older investors do.\nMoreover, 86% of older investors would not give up any or only a trivial amount of returns for carbon emission reductions, while 64% of younger investors would give up moderate or large amounts. Additionally, 91% of older investors are unwilling to sacrifice returns for workplace diversity improvements, compared to 62% of younger investors who are willing to do so.\nThe survey also found that investor attitudes towards ESG differ across fund companies. Investors in State Street and Invesco funds exhibit nearly twice the concern for environmental issues compared to those in Fidelity funds. A significant percentage of investors in Fidelity (40-45%) and Vanguard funds are unwilling to forfeit returns for ESG, while a smaller percentage in American Funds and BlackRock (25-30%) share this reluctance.\nDespite these differences, 83% of investors across all demographics believe that fund managers should consider their views when voting on ESG issues. The results suggest that fund managers might need to allocate votes on a proportional basis to reflect the diverse preferences of their investor base.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we scoured through several threads to discover which companies were considered ethical according to the users. We narrowed down the list to 7 stocks that were most widely mentioned and used the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as a tie-breaker. The companies are listed in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of the second quarter of 2024. The hedge fund data was taken from our database of over 900 elite hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a California-based prominent tech company that is recognized for its groundbreaking advancements in graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI. Originally concentrating on the gaming sector, the company developed sophisticated graphics solutions but has since broadened its range to include high-performance computing, AI hardware, and software.\nIn its Graphics segment, it provides GeForce GPUs designed for gaming and personal computers, along with the GeForce NOW game streaming service. This segment also includes Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs aimed at enterprise workstations and Omniverse software for creating and managing metaverse environments.\nThe Compute and Networking segment covers a wide range of solutions, including data center computing platforms and comprehensive networking systems. This segment also features Jetson robotics and various embedded platforms, as well as NVIDIA AI Enterprise, among other offerings. It tops our list of the best ethical companies to invest in.\nIn the second quarter, 179 hedge funds held positions in NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and their stakes amounted to $53.67 billion. As of June 30, Fisher Asset Management is the most dominant shareholder in the company and has a position worth $11.54 billion.\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is making significant strides in addressing environmental concerns within the technology sector, especially in the context of artificial intelligence. According to digital news brand, Stockhead, the company\u2019s advancements in GPUs are evidence of this effort. Its GPUs are highly regarded for their efficiency compared to traditional central processing units (CPUs), particularly in handling AI workloads.\nAccording to CEO Jensen Huang, the GPUs are up to 20 times more energy-efficient for specific AI and high-performance computing tasks than CPUs. This efficiency is critical for reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in data centers, which are becoming increasingly important as the demand for AI technology grows.\nIn addition to their efficiency, the company\u2019s RAPIDS Accelerator is an important innovation that further enhances environmental sustainability. By optimizing the processing capabilities of its GPUs, the RAPIDS Accelerator can potentially cut a data center\u2019s carbon footprint by up to 80%.\nMajor companies such as Adobe and AT&T have tested this technology and reported faster processing speeds, reduced costs, and improvements in AI model training. Furthermore, the Perlmutter supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center in Berkeley demonstrated a five-fold increase in energy efficiency by utilizing Nvidia\u2019s A100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has also made significant advancements in AI ethics as evidenced by initiatives led by Nikki Pope, the company\u2019s first-ever head of AI and legal ethics. Her team has introduced a beta-testing process involving community resource groups from diverse backgrounds to help identify and address unintended biases in AI products. This approach ensures that the company\u2019s AI models are not only more efficient but also more equitable and transparent.\nThe \u201cModel Card++\u201d project, which enhances the transparency of AI models by providing detailed information on privacy, safety, and bias, has been well-received and represents its commitment to ethical AI development. The company\u2019s ability to deliver powerful, efficient solutions and its proactive approach to addressing AI ethics make it a compelling player in the tech industry.\nFurthermore, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) also seems to have a healthy work culture as the company promotes a collaborative and non-hierarchical work environment, where teams are formed based on project needs and innovation is encouraged, even at the risk of failure. It is dedicated to providing excellent pay, benefits, and a supportive work culture, allowing employees to do meaningful work.\nThe company offers several benefits to support employees and their families through various life events. These include resources for building a family, such as adoption, fertility, and surrogacy support, as well as assistance for developmental disabilities through RethinkCare. The company also provides college preparation resources through Collegewise, and offers support for life changes like marriage, divorce, having a child, moving, buying a home, and becoming eligible for Medicare. The company extends benefits for mourning, gender affirmation, and LGBTQ+ support, and offers guidance for those leaving the company.\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of best ethical companies to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.
