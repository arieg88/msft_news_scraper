        "Text": "Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), starts his day inspiringly. While many leaders are overwhelmed by endless to-do lists, Huang ensures his priorities are in check before his workday begins.\n\u201cI begin each morning by doing my highest priority work first,\u201d Huang says. \u201cBefore I even get to work, my day is already a success.\u201d\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion \u2013 they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nHuang's strategy is simple but powerful: get the most important tasks done first no matter what. This gives him a sense of completion even before his workday officially begins and he doesn\u2019t get upset by disruptions during the day because of it.\nWhen people apologize for interrupting him, he tells them, \u201cI have plenty of time.\u201d He says it out of true courtesy, not merely to be nice. Because he sets priorities for his day and completes important tasks ahead of schedule, he has more time to assist others and handle unforeseen situations.\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nHuang also prefers not to schedule one-on-one meetings with his direct reports but makes himself available whenever they need him. He shared at a Stanford University talk that his management team consists of 55 people reporting directly to him and the structure is meant to be agile and allow information to flow freely.\n\nSee Also: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.\nInstead of holding regular meetings, Huang prioritizes availability when needed. \u201cUnless they need me,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I\u2019ll drop everything for them.\u201d He and his team maintain open communication throughout the day, which also means there are no formal performance reviews \u2013 just ongoing, real-time feedback.\nThis sense of clarity and resilience helped Huang and Nvidia defy early critics. In the company's early days, he was told that Nvidia would never grow larger than a billion dollars. But Huang didn't let this underestimation limit him. \u201cA long time ago, I was told that Nvidia could never be larger than a billion dollars,\u201d he recalls. \u201cObviously, that was an underestimation, underimagination of the size of the opportunity.\u201d\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nInstead of staying in its lane, Nvidia expanded far beyond graphics chips into AI, health care, autonomous vehicles and more, pushing its valuation to over three trillion dollars.\nHuang approaches his work with a combination of perseverance, discipline and generosity.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 8 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other high growth high market stocks to invest in.\nWhen investor confidence is high, capital tends to flow into growth sectors, driving up stock prices and valuations. This is particularly relevant for companies with strong growth prospects and high margins, as they are often seen as more resilient in a recovering economy. Current market dynamics indicate that much of the upward movement may be attributed to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. High-growth stocks typically trade at higher price-to-earnings ratios, so if the market continues to expand, these stocks could benefit significantly as investors are willing to pay a premium for growth potential.\nJason Trennert, Strategas Research Partners chairman and CEO, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on October 3 to discuss the latest market trends and the state of the economy, highlighting that the bar is high to get bearish now.\nJason Trennert revealed that he turned bullish at the end of 2023 after initially predicting a recession. Despite the challenges of 2022 and early 2023, which made it difficult to envision a market recovery, he noted that the market has defied expectations and continued to rise. Trennert attributed a significant portion of this upward movement to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. He marked a pivotal moment in 2023 as the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, which led to increased liquidity in the market and a subsequent rally. He recalled that around eleven months ago, the S&P 500 briefly hit 4,100 when ten-year yields reached 5%, suggesting that market dynamics have shifted considerably since then.\nWhen discussing current valuations, Trennert pointed out that the market is trading at approximately 22 times earnings during an easing cycle. He expressed skepticism about future earnings growth, as expectations for a 14% increase in S&P earnings next year seem inconsistent with the anticipated six rate cuts from the Fed. He emphasized that if the market is expecting such significant easing while also projecting strong earnings growth, there may be a disconnect.\nTrennert also addressed concerns regarding government spending and deficits, noting that the federal deficit has reached 7% of GDP and expressing a desire for more free-market-oriented policies rather than gridlock in Washington. He criticized both parties for their lack of commitment to reducing deficits and highlighted the moral hazard created by prolonged quantitative easing over the past 12 years. He believes that this situation has led to irresponsible spending practices that will eventually necessitate accountability. Despite these concerns, Trennert acknowledged that it is challenging to adopt a bearish outlook given current market conditions. He noted that ten-year treasury yields above 4.5% typically lead to market indigestion, while yields below this threshold make it hard to remain pessimistic.\nAs for small-cap stocks, Trennert pointed out that they have historically been underrepresented in portfolios and may offer opportunities for future growth. He highlighted that many venture capital-backed firms are looking to go public, with approximately 45% of them potentially tapping into the IPO market at some point. However, he cautioned that if the economy continues to slow down and earnings growth expectations are not met, small caps may struggle.\nSkepticism about the projected earnings growth for the S&P 500 could also apply to high-growth stocks. If expectations for earnings growth are too optimistic relative to economic conditions, such as anticipated rate cuts, it may lead to volatility in high-growth stocks, especially if actual earnings do not meet these elevated expectations. Companies with high-profit margins are generally better positioned to weather economic downturns. As Trennert noted concerns regarding government spending and deficits, firms that maintain or improve their profit margins may be more attractive to investors seeking stability amidst economic uncertainty.\nTrennert\u2019s overall analysis underscores the importance of monitoring government policies and economic indicators as they influence investor sentiment and market performance moving forward. Still, his predominantly bullish sentiment lays the groundwork for a lot of investors, and to make the portfolio expansion process even easier for them, we\u2019re here with a list of the\u00a08 high growth high margin stocks to invest in now.\nMethodology\nWe sifted through Finviz to compile an initial list of the top stocks. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 15 companies with TTM net profit margin above 20% and 5-year net income compound annual growth rates above 25%. We then selected the 8 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 56.73%\nTTM Net Profit Margin: 55.04%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the pioneer of GPU-accelerated computing, specializing in products and platforms for the large, growing markets of gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. Its GPUs have been instrumental in driving advancements in various fields, including deep learning, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality.\nNetApp has launched a new AI tool utilizing NVIDIA technology. Elon Musk\u2019s xAI is leveraging 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for its AI project, Colossal, with potential future expansion to include H200 GPUs and Blackwell chips.\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has formed a strategic partnership with Accenture to accelerate AI innovation. Its AI chip, Blackwell, is now in mass production and experiencing high demand.\u00a0A partnership with Salesforce is established to enhance businesses\u2019 utilization of AI and data. In September, the company introduced Aerial, an AI tool designed to optimize wireless networks for various devices. Its proprietary software, CUDA, provides a competitive edge. The company\u2019s continued success hinges on its ability to sustain innovation and monetize AI effectively.\nThe company\u2019s CEO believes its competitive advantage in AI chips is sustainable. Snowflake, a cloud data warehousing company, that utilizes Nvidia\u2019s AI Enterprise software to integrate NeMo Retriever microservices into its Snowflake Cortex AI, has seen its stock price rise 10% in the past month due to strong prospects driven by a strong portfolio and expanding partner base.\nThe recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and upward stock movement all point to a potential continued upward trajectory. Investors may want to consider adding NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) to their watchlist or portfolios given its positive momentum.\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cOver the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\u201d\nOverall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of high growth high market stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": " Laura Bratton    ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock sank 4.5% Tuesday, partially reversing its two week-rally and coming down from a record close the day before.\nThe stock's tumble began before the market opened in response to a Bloomberg report that Biden administration officials are considering capping US chip exports to certain countries. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that potential regulations would focus on Persian Gulf countries in the interest of national security.\nThe stocks of fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC) also fell on the news. Intel declined to comment on the report. Nvidia and AMD did not immediately respond to requests from Yahoo Finance.\n\"While NVDIA has not disclosed its sales to the Gulf region, the level of investment in AI from that region has been very substantial,\" DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance. \"More importantly, if the government continues to narrow the geographies chip companies can sell into, they are significantly narrowing the market for AI services for NVDIA customers Microsoft, Google and Amazon.\"\nAdding to the woes of chip stocks Tuesday was a dismal earnings report from semiconductor equipment supplier ASML (ASML). The Dutch company \u2014 which sells equipment to Nvidia's chip manufacturer TSMC as well as Intel \u2014 reported booking orders worth just \u20ac2.6 billion ($2.8 billion) for the third quarter, far lower than the \u20ac5.39 billion forecast by Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg.\nThe PHLX Semiconductor index (^SOX) fell 5.3% Tuesday, far underperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which was down 0.7% at market close.\nNvidia\u2019s decline Tuesday partially reverses a two-week winning streak that saw the stock rally to a new record closing price Monday, nearly eclipsing Apple (AAPL) as Wall Street\u2019s most valuable company. Shares closed above $138 Monday, ahead of its previous record of $135.58 in June. Nvidia's tear was fueled by industry leaders' comments about intense demand for its AI chips and renewed bullishness over AI.\nNvidia stock has been more volatile since its 10-for-1 stock split in June, and news of heightened trade tensions focused on the AI chip sector \u2014 which Nvidia leads \u2014 has pushed shares down various times over the past two years. For example, Nvidia shares experienced a similar decline this time last year \u2014 when the Biden administration tightened export controls on US chips \u2014 before extending its historic rally.\nDespite Tuesday\u2019s decline, Nvidia shares are up 190% from last year. While demand for its AI chips is strong in the near term, a potential slowdown in AI spending by Big Tech companies is another cause for concern to investors, in addition to geopolitical risks. DA Davidson's Gil Luria recently told Yahoo Finance that AI spending could ease as soon as 2025, which would be bad news for Nvidia shares.\nNvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

Dell Technologies Inc. also has said that Blackwell-based servers will be generally available at the beginning of 2025.\nNvidia products have become a prized commodity among data center operators, which use the chips to develop AI software and services. The Santa Clara, California-based company acknowledged in August that Blackwell proved more difficult to produce than anticipated. The company said that it was making changes to improve its manufacturing yield \u2014 the number of functioning chips that come out of factories.\nSupplies will be plentiful after manufacturing gains momentum, CEO Jensen Huang said in a Bloomberg Television interview at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have lots and lots of supply, and we will be able to ramp,\u201d he said.\n--With assistance from Matt Day.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAI Detectors Falsely Accuse Students of Cheating\u2014With Big Consequences\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs\nNeuralink Co-Founder\u2019s New Startup Sells a Brain Computer Toolkit\nA Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work\nHow Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.\nThe labor market has been more resilient than ever. On October 4, Gary Cohn, the IBM vice chairman, and former US National Economic Council director in the Trump administration, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the job report and the US economy.\nCohn suggests that the jobs data is the least scientific information the government puts out and therefore, it must be taken with a grain of salt. However, he emphasizes the importance of understanding trends. The number of people entering the workforce is expanding and jobs are being created, deducing that the market is in a neutral place.\nCohn believes that the US economy is normalizing. He reveals that we have not lived in a normal economy in over a decade, therefore, relative to history, the status quo is fairly reasonable. He adds that the Fed has orchestrated a soft landing and expects another 50 basis point cut before the end of 2024, which according to him is still restrictive.\nAs the AI flame starts to settle, the market may be up for a major shift. On October 7, Keith Buchanan, GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss his expectations of the market.\nExpectations for earnings have been revised from mid-single digits to mid-double digitals, promising robust growth as 2024 comes to a close. Buchanan suggests that most of the growth comes from artificial intelligence and the widening of earnings growth beyond traditional growth sectors like technology.\nThis year, the industrial and energy sectors have enjoyed greater returns capturing a large chunk of the market. Buchanan is highly bullish on AI plays and value stocks. He also adds that names in financials, industrials, and consumer discretionary are poised for growth ahead of 2024. He advises investors to consider geopolitical events before making any investment decisions.\nNow that we have assessed the future of the financial markets and possible sectors eyeing growth, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo find the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds, we went over multiple rankings over the internet to list long-term blue chip stocks. We then examined the analyst upside and the hedge fund sentiment of these stocks as of Q2 2024 and picked the most popular ones. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024 as a primary metric and analyst upside as of October 13, as a secondary metric.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nAnalyst Upside as of October 13, 2024: 11%\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), also referred to as the AI star, is one of the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. The chip maker is also a provider of cloud services and gaming products.\nThe company is rapidly growing and garnering attention from across the globe to the point that it has the power to influence financial markets. Such can be attributed to its advancements in technology and its strategic partnerships. Recently the company closed a deal with Salesforce and also launched a new AI tool to meet the needs of the next generation of mobiles, robots, autonomous vehicles, and 5G. On October 8, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) partnered with TSMC to push the limits for the next generation of advanced semiconductor chips using Nvidia\u2019s computational lithography platform.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to generate $32.5 billion in revenue during the fiscal third quarter of 2024. This revenue is likely to come from its rapidly growing Hopper architecture and its new and improved Blackwell Chips. By the end of this year, the company is also expected to ramp up production for the chips.\nThere is no denying that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a crucial role to play in the artificial intelligence industry, which explains why 179 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the close of Q2 2024. Analysts\u2019 12-month median price target of $150 points to a 111% upside from current levels.\nIthaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d\nOverall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "NVIDIA (NVDA, Financial) is setting the pace in the GPU market with its upcoming GeForce RTX 5090, part of its next-gen RTX 50 \"Blackwell\" series, set to be unveiled at CES 2025. Despite rampant speculation, sources close to the matter suggest that the RTX 5090 will not see a significant price hike compared to its predecessor, the RTX 4090.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nThe RTX 5090 is tipped to be the fastest \"out-of-the-box\" GPU on the market, boasting a base frequency nearing 2.9 GHz, 32 GB of VRAM, and over 21,000 cores. These impressive specs have led to rumors of a steep price tag, with figures as high as $2,500 floated for the RXT 5090, and over $1,000 for the RTX 5080. However, these price points are now being dismissed as exaggerated.\nAs NVIDIA prepares for the official launch, it is currently briefing partners on the specifications and configurations, but no official pricing has been decided. Pricing will likely be established close to launch, following NVIDIA's tradition of aligning initial reviews and releases with the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). The MSRP is particularly significant as it sets the cost basis for NVIDIA's Founders Edition designs.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Nvidia (NVDA)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 16.2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $140.89 in the previous session. Nvidia has gained 176.5% since the start of the year compared to the 26.5% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 124.7% return for the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry.\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on August 28, 2024, Nvidia reported EPS of $0.68 versus consensus estimate of $0.64.\nFor the current fiscal year, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share on $124.66 billion in revenues. This represents a 116.15% change in EPS on a 104.63% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.73 per share on $174.35 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 32.75% and 39.86%, respectively.\nNvidia may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\nNvidia has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 48.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 24.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 110.4X versus its peer group's average of 11X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.17. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Nvidia fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Nvidia shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This gives him a sense of completion even before his workday officially begins and he doesn\u2019t get upset by disruptions during the day because of it.\nWhen people apologize for interrupting him, he tells them, \u201cI have plenty of time.\u201d He says it out of true courtesy, not merely to be nice.

These chips, dubbed Blackwell, are now expected to hit the market a quarter later in Q4. Luckily, this delay is shorter than some feared, and the company assured investors that the delay had been accounted for in its guidance.\nCritically, any loss from Blackwell chips in the short term is being compensated for by the still extremely high demand for its current-generation Hopper chips. When Blackwell does begin rolling out, the company expects the demand to be even stronger. As CEO Jensen Huang put it, \"The anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.\"\nNow, while Nvidia has generally delivered on its promises in the past, it's a good idea to take a company's promises with a grain of salt. Company brass was a little light on details around the delay, and there is always a chance that things won't go as planned. If more delays are announced, it could spell trouble for Nvidia.

That is almost entirely coming from its data center growth.\nNow, its chips are undoubtedly the heart of this, but it's not the only product the company offers in this segment. Nvidia aims to be a full-service provider of data center hardware and software. Nvidia has a platform called Spectrum-X that, although launched as recently as last year, has already seen a big uptick in sales.\nThe platform is a networking solution that allows customers to keep up with the intensive networking demands of AI computing without abandoning ethernet. Ethernet \u2014 a networking technology \u2014 has been the standard for decades and is used in almost every data center in the world. As Nvidia continues to build ever more powerful chips, existing ethernet networks are struggling to keep up with the flow of data, creating a bottleneck.\nThis could mean having to retrofit a data center, removing the miles and miles of ethernet cables and associated hardware, and replacing it with faster technology. Remember, these data centers are massive \u2014 we're talking the size of multiple football fields in some cases \u2014 so you can imagine this would be incredibly costly. Spectrum-X allows the bones of these networks to remain, upgrading only critical parts of the network infrastructure.

CFO, Colette Kress reported that Nvidia's \"Ethernet for AI\" \u2014 of which Spectrum-X is a primary part \u2014 revenue \"doubled sequentially with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings\" and that the platform \"has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners.\" The company expects Spectrum to be a multibillion-dollar product line in a year.\nBeyond this, Nvidia is rolling out new software to help companies build custom AI solutions and is pushing further into the automotive industry, a segment that could be massive in a few years' time once driverless technology matures. In the short term, however, this will still be a significant revenue source as AI is integrated into car \"infotainment\" systems.

Yes, at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 56.07, it does carry a premium, but this is pretty much at or below where it has been trading since the beginning of 2020.

The artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant has delivered triple-digit gains in earnings quarter after quarter, and that has prompted the stock to skyrocket. Nvidia shares have climbed more than 2,500% over the past five years and are heading for an increase of more than 160% in 2024.\nAll of this sounds great, but you may be wondering if this AI star will continue to rocket higher in the months to come or if another AI player could offer you a better investment opportunity. A good example is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), a networking company that may be earlier in its AI growth story, offering stronger potential for gains ahead.\nShould you forget Nvidia and buy this AI stock right now?\nBroadcom is a networking giant, selling thousands of products used in the areas of data center networking, home connectivity, smartphones, and more. But in recent times, AI has emerged as a key growth area for the company, and Broadcom even said in its latest earnings report that AI revenue continues to \"grow strongly.\"\nIn the quarter, Broadcom said demand from hyperscalers -- or large-scale data centers -- for AI networking and custom accelerators drove a 47% increase in revenue, to more than $13 billion. Custom AI accelerators more than tripled year over year, while Ethernet switching grew four times, and optical lasers and dies used in optical interconnects increased by three. Finally, PCI Express switches more than doubled from last year's level.\nBroadcom expects AI revenue to climb sequentially by 10% to $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter and predicts AI revenue of $12 billion for the year -- up from an earlier forecast for $11 billion. All of this is as hyperscalers expand their AI clusters. Considering that today's AI market is forecast to grow from $200 billion to $1 trillion by the end of the decade, this trend may continue.\nAlong with this, Broadcom's purchase of cloud computing company VMWare offers another potential growth driver in the months and years to come. The VMWare Cloud Foundation (VCF) is a complete software stack that virtualizes an entire data center for a customer. Recent bookings for VCF helped Broadcom reach an annualized booking value of $2.5 billion during the quarter, up 32% from the previous quarter.\nOn top of this, Broadcom is well ahead of its VMWare profitability goals. The company, when it acquired VMWare last year, aimed to generate adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $8.5 billion three years after the operation. Today, Broadcom says it's set to meet or beat that goal as early as the 2025 fiscal year.\nNow let's consider whether we should forget about Nvidia and turn to this growing AI player, instead. Nvidia's earnings are difficult to beat these days, and considering the company's focus on innovation and the general growth projections for the AI market, it could continue to deliver this top performance.\nBut Nvidia's stock may not continue to soar in a straight line, and at a certain point, could stagnate or dip. The shares don't look expensive today at 46x forward earnings estimates, considering its growth, but Broadcom, which also offers a solid growth story, looks cheaper.\nBroadcom stock has climbed in recent years. It performed so well that the company launched a 10-for-1 stock split (like Nvidia) earlier this year to bring the shares down to a level that's more accessible to a broader range of investors.\nBroadcom's double-digit share-price increase this year still pales, compared to the performance of Nvidia. This, along with a reasonable valuation, leaves plenty of room for the stock to run in the near term and over time. All this means that you shouldn't forget Nvidia forever, but right now, you may want to favor buying Broadcom and potentially benefit from the early days of this company's AI growth story.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is on the verge of something big. As of this writing, the company's market cap is $3.3 trillion, only $150 billion behind the world's largest company -- Apple.\nGranted, Nvidia has already claimed the top spot before -- this year, in fact. Yet, this time might be different. It's possible that Nvidia might stay put atop the list.\nSo, what's likely in store for this giant company over the next year? And is now the right time for investors to buy? Let's have a closer look.\nThere's one simple reason why Nvidia's stock has surged by 1,000% over the last two years: artificial intelligence (AI). \nSimply put, the skyrocketing demand for AI-powered applications has caught much of the world by surprise -- but not Nvidia. Indeed, the company spent years positioning itself for the AI revolution, and because of that, it's now reaping the benefits.\nThe company's top-of-the-line graphics processing units (GPUs) are the brains behind much of the world's best AI tools. What's more, the company is already hard at work developing the next cutting-edge GPUs that will power the next wave of AI-related innovation. \nThe company's new Blackwell GPUs are currently in production and expected to ship to clients in the fourth quarter. These chips, which reportedly sell for between $30,000 and $40,000, are perhaps the most sought-after technology on the planet. As Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said, \"Everyone wants to have the most [Blackwell GPUs], and everybody wants to be the first.\"\nAs a result of all that incredible demand for its GPUs, Nvidia's key fundamentals are only getting better. Consider this: In 2022, Nvidia's annual revenue was $27 billion. Over the last 12 months, Nvidia has reported $96 billion in revenue -- roughly four times its 2022 total. What's more, analysts expect the company to report $178 billion by 2026.\nNeedless to say, that's incredible growth, and it's the biggest reason Nvidia's stock is skyrocketing. However, it gets even better. Nvidia's profits are growing even more quickly. \nThe company reported $4.4 billion in net income in 2022. Over the last 12 months, that figure has jumped to $53 billion -- an increase of some 1,200%.\nSimply put, it's difficult to know where Nvidia's stock will be, because Nvidia's revenue and earnings growth are so incredibly high. If the company meets or beats expectations, its stock will soar even higher; if it misses those expectations, its stock could plummet.\nHowever, long-term investors should do their best to put those considerations to one side. Ultimately, the key fact about Nvidia is that its products are the premier choice for developers who are leading humanity through its latest technological revolution. \nThere are likely to be ups and downs along the way, but Nvidia remains a solid long-term stock to own because of its key place within the ongoing AI revolution. So far, that has carried the company to within a whisper of being the world's most valuable company. Over the next year, I believe the stock will establish itself at the top of the list.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $846,108!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz chief economic advisor, talked about the possibility of a soft landing vs no landing during a program on CNBC. When asked what would it take for the market to have a no-landing scenario, the analyst said:\n\u201cI think we need the productivity enhancers from A.I., from life sciences to come earlier, we need to continue to have positive shocks to our labor force. And if we get those two things, you can get the bigger but not hotter economy which actually would be perfect for almost everything you can think of, from households to companies to financial markets.\u201d\nThe analyst does not rule out the possibility of a recession, however.\n\u201cMy probability of a soft landing is 55%, and a recession is 30%. A soft landing is the most likely scenario, but it\u2019s not dominant. Why isn\u2019t it dominant? Because we have weakness in the household sector, particularly on the lower-income side, and the Fed has been unpredictable. Just think, Morgan\u2014at the end of July, the Fed didn\u2019t cut rates because everything seemed fine. By the next meeting in mid-September, it cut 50 basis points. And now it\u2019s talking about cautious cuts. So, the Fed needs to be careful.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nStacy Rasgon, Bernstein senior analyst, while talking about Nvidia in a latest program on CNBC, said:\n\u201cPeople are getting excited about the story again as we approach earnings, year-end, and next year when the new platform with Blackwell starts to ramp up. By all indications\u2014based on supply chain checks and everything else\u2014demand for this product looks off the charts.\u201d\nThe analyst said Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0was able to work through the Blackwell delays and it did not impact its business. He thinks the stock is \u201cnot expensive.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s much cheaper today than it was before the run started a year and a half ago. The stock has risen significantly, but earnings have increased even more than the stock.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\nAt Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\nOf course, Nvidia won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cOver the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\u201d\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other most profitable growth stocks to invest in.\nAfter the September inflation report, the market did feel a slight bit of panic but it seems to be fading away. After the report, the market expectations for a rate cut shifted, with 79.9% of participants predicting a cut to 450-475 basis points, while 20.1% expect the rates to remain unchanged. It was a change from 32.1% expecting a 50 bps rate cut and 67.9% anticipating a 25 bps cut at the beginning of the month as mentioned in our\u00a08 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Invest in\u00a0article.\nHowever, on October 11, the CME FedWatch tool showed that 89.5% of the market now expects a 25 bps rate cut and the rest expect it to remain the same.\nChristian Mueller-Glissmann from Goldman Sachs joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 to discuss the latest market trends. He believes that the stock market pullback in August could be a warning of more potential corrections, but he does not see a severe bear market ahead. His overall outlook is positive due to a healthy macroeconomic environment, where growth remains stable, inflation is under control, and central banks are starting to reduce rates. These factors create a favorable setting for equities and other risk assets.\nHe pointed out that while bullish market positioning contributed to August\u2019s setback, the combination of declining inflation and rate cuts allows central banks to cushion against financial shocks, minimizing the risk of a deep downturn.\nMueller-Glissmann highlighted two key reasons for not expecting a major market decline: inflation has significantly dropped, giving central banks more flexibility, and price momentum over the past 6-12 months suggests a strong macroeconomic backdrop. With the labor market improving, he sees no signs of an economic downturn.\nHis strategy focuses on quality growth stocks that are temporarily undervalued and cyclical value stocks that could recover as the market stabilizes. Regarding inflation, he noted a shift from inflation relief to growth as the main market driver, raising concerns about inflation resurfacing if growth strengthens.

Next, we narrowed our list to 12 stocks with the highest TTM net income. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 database of 912 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n5-Year Revenue CAGR: 56.73%\nTTM Net Income: $53.009 billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in graphics, computing, and networking solutions, gaining recognition for its powerful graphics processing units (GPUs). While it started in gaming, the company has expanded into professional visualization, data centers, and automotive industries. It is also actively expanding its footing in other major growth industries such as AI and 5G. It tops our list of most profitable growth stocks.\nAlthough the company\u2019s stock fell after its Q2 results, this was expected due to delays in the Blackwell GPU, which will not affect its core design or growth potential. Moreover, the demand for Blackwell GPU is strong as reported by Morgan Stanley. The firm reported that the demand for the company\u2019s Blackwell NVL36/72 systems is so high that they are sold out for the next year.\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives has reiterated that NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) will greatly benefit from increased spending on AI. He noted that the demand for AI chips is skyrocketing, and expects that the AI infrastructure market could grow tenfold by 2027, with $1 trillion in spending expected over the next three years.\nAt the March 2024 GPU Technology Conference, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure to be around $250 billion, with total spending over the next decade potentially reaching $1 trillion to $2 trillion as countries invest in AI.\nWhile NVIDIA won\u2019t capture the entire $2 trillion market due to competition from AMD and tech giants like Google and Amazon, analysts believe NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) could secure over $950 billion in market share from 2025 to 2029, making it a leader in the data center sector.\nIthaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs).

NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d\nOverall, NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of most profitable growth stocks to invest in.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Tech led US stocks higher on Thursday as TSMC's (TSM) upbeat outlook eased worries about artificial intelligence chip demand, helping lift shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) to an intraday all-time high. Strong retail sales data also reinforced overall strength in the US economy.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose just over the flatline, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) ticked below it, after briefly touching an intraday record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.4% to hover near all-time highs.\nContract chipmaker TSMC posted a 54% jump in quarterly profit to beat Wall Street estimates and raised its forecast for 2024 revenue growth amid surging AI demand. The outlook boost from the main chipmaker for Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia reassured a market spooked by ASML's (ASML) downbeat sales forecast, reviving hopes for an AI boom.\nTSMC's US-listed shares climbed about 10%, crossing a $1 trillion market valuation. Its forecast helped spur a rally in chip stocks, including Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia, which all were up more than 2%.\nOn the data front, retail sales jumped 0.4%, more than the 0.3% rise expected, giving credence to the argument the economy could be reaccelerating following a surprisingly strong September jobs report. Weekly jobless claims came in at 241,000, far below expectations, and a drop from the prior week's upwardly revised 260,000. The data released Thursday morning was watched by investors debating whether the Federal Reserve will hold off from cutting interest rates in November.\nAfter a stellar showing by big banks, the focus is now on Big Tech earnings to wipe away the disappointments of the last quarter.

A week earlier, it was 6.32%.\nAs Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports, mortgage rates have been on the rise as markets adjust expectations about the size and pace of future Federal Reserve rate cuts. The recent upticks have curtailed refinancing activity and kept the pace of home buying anemic.\nRead more here. \nAffirm stock (AFRM) fell around 8% on Thursday shortly after Apple said it's making rival Klarna's flexible payment options available via Apple Wallet on iOS 18. Affirm's buy now, pay later service is already available on Apple Pay: The financial tech company and Apple announced the deal in September.\nApple also said Thursday that it's adding expanded Affirm options. Apple iOS 18 users can now use Affirm's installment loan service intended to help users with larger purchases.\nThe move lower in Affirm stock follows a rally in the past two weeks, as four Wall Street analysts upgraded their ratings on the stock to Overweight or Equal Weight. Of the analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, some 10 recommend buying the stock, while 10 have an Equal Weight rating, and two maintain a Sell rating, Bloomberg data shows.\nDespite Affirm's decline Thursday, the stock is up more than 30% from three months ago, as shares rallied following the company's most recent earnings report, which topped expectations.

Spot gold also rose to a daily high just north of $2,690.\nYear to date, gold is up more than 30%, beating out the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gain of roughly 22%.\nThe expectation that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates coupled with central banks' accumulation of the yellow metal has made gold one of the best-performing commodities of 2024.\nHomebuilders are feeling more confident about the housing market despite a recent sharp rise in mortgage rates.\nThe National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose two points to 43 in October from the previous month, marking the second consecutive monthly gain. October\u2019s reading was higher than economists\u2019 estimates of 42, per Bloomberg data.\nStill, any reading under 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good.\n\u201cWhile housing affordability remains low, builders are feeling more optimistic about 2025 market conditions,\u201d NAHB Chairman Carl Harris, a custom homebuilder from Wichita, Kan., said in a press release.\nMortgage rates have been rising recently, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed rate loan climbing to 6.32% last week from 6.12% a week earlier in the biggest week-over-week increase since April., according to Freddie Mac. Mortgage rates, which tend to follow US Treasury yields, have been recently moving upward as strong job growth and persistent inflation leads traders to pare back their expectations on how aggressively the Fed will cut interest rates.\nThe NAHB survey also showed more builders offered concessions in October. The survey found that 62% of builders used some sort of sales incentive to close the deal, up from 61% in September. Meanwhile, 32% of builders cut home prices to bolster sales in October, similar to last month. The average price reduction was 6%, up from 5% last month.\nThe gauge measuring sales outlook over the next six months rose 4 points to 57. The prospective-buyer traffic gauge and the NAHB index of current sales conditions also both gained two points in October.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) touched record intraday highs on Thursday morning, gaining roughly 0.3% and 0.4% respectively.\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.6%, with Technology (XLK) leading the gains.\nLucid shares tanked more than 14% on Thursday morning after the luxury electric vehicle maker announced a stock offering to raise about $1.67 billion.\nYear to date, Lucid shares are down more than 32%.\nThe major averages rose on Thursday with tech stocks leading the gains after chipmaker TSMC's (TSM) upbeat outlook helped send the semiconductor sector higher.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%.\nStrong economic data also helped lift stocks. September's retail sales rose 0.4% versus estimates of 0.3% \u2014 a sharp increase from August's 0.1% rise.\nMeanwhile, jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 12 came in at 241,000, versus estimates of 259,000.\nSeptember's retail sales rose 0.4% versus estimates of 0.3% \u2014 a sharp acceleration off August's 0.1% growth.\nMeanwhile, jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 12 came in at 241,000, versus estimates of 259,000. The prior week's reading was revised up to 260,000.\nThe data released Thursday morning gives fuel to the argument that the economy could be reaccelerating following a strong September jobs report. Investors were watching the data for clues on what the Federal Reserve's interest rate move will be at the next FOMC meeting in November.\nUS-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) surged 9.6% in premarket trading, putting the stock in position for an all-time high after its third quarter earnings beat analyst estimates. TSMC recorded a 54% jump in profit and raised its full-year revenue outlook.\nTSMC manufactures chips for Nvidia (NVDA) and its rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as well as Broadcom (AVGO) and many other tech firms. Nvidia shares jumped 3%, AMD rose 2.7%, and Broadcom jumped 2.8% premarket on the news.\nHere's a look at TSMC's results:\nThe chip stocks' rally partially reverses the sector's losses earlier this week, driven by fears over potential further US trade restrictions and a gloomy report from semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML.\nAnalysts at Needham, Bernstein, Barclays, and other investment firms reiterated their Buy ratings on TSM stock on Thursday morning.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.24, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 42 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.24 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 42 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.7% and 4.8% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Nvidia, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $2.81.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Druckenmiller spoke this week to Bloomberg\u2019s Sonali Basak.\n\u201cI\u2019ve made so many mistakes in my investment career; one of them was I sold all my Nvidia, probably somewhere between $800 and $950. I think it\u2019s somewhere around $1,300 [per share] on that stock now,\u201d said Druckenmiller on Wednesday.\nNvidia\u2019s stock is trading at about $139.59 today, after undergoing a 10-for-1 stock split effective in June 2024 that made it more accessible to a broader range of investors, particularly those with smaller accounts. Duquesne built an impressive stake in the AI darling, now dominant in the GPU market. In 2022 Duquesne owned about $400 million in Nvidia stock, making it the office\u2019s top holding. He began shaving it off in 2023. By August 2024, Druckenmiller had fully exited his position in Nvidia\u2019s stock.\n\u201cI own none today,\u201c Druckenmiller confirmed to Bloomberg. \u201cIt was a big mistake.\u201d\nHe initially expected to hold the stock for years, but then the value tripled in a year, and he thought the valuation was \u201crich.\u201d Nvidia\u2019s stock then skyrocketed in 2024, driven by soaring demand for its AI chips. Billionaire Oracle cofounder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison recently admitted that he treated Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to dinner at Nobu, along with Elon Musk, to beg Huang to give them more GPUs.\n\u201cI would describe the dinner as Oracle\u2014me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs,\u201d Ellison recalled. \u201cPlease take our money. Please take our money. By the way, I got dinner. No, no, take more of it. We need you to take more of our money please.\u201d\nDruckenmiller said he still has designs on AI, and it\u2019s never say never on buying Nvidia in the future.\n\u201cWere the price to come down, we\u2019d get involved again,\u201d added Druckenmiller. \u201cBut right now, I\u2019m licking my wounds from a bad sale there.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) notched a record high closing price as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom, placing the chipmaker in contention for the top spot as Wall Street's most valuable company.\nShares rose 2.4% Monday to above $138. Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. \nNvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains.\nThe stock\u2019s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips.\nNvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by an abundance of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs \u201cremains extremely robust.\u201d A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia\u2019s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday.\nNvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan\u2019s largest supercomputer during Foxconn\u2019s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it\u2019s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia\u2019s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions.\nNvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday after market close, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year.\nNvidia\u2019s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company\u2019s second quarter earnings.\nShares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China due to rising trade tensions with the US had also driven shares down. Nvidia\u2019s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June.\nOther recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations \u2014 another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term.\n\u201cAI is hot,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, \u201cI see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.\u201d\nThe chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech\u2019s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown.\nSemiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia\u2019s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet \u201ccrazy\u201d demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell chips has been \u201cinsane.\u201d\nNvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has delivered stunning returns once again in 2024 following a blistering performance last year, but a closer look at the company's price chart will tell us that it has lost momentum over the past three months.\nNvidia stock has remained flat during this period because of doubts surrounding the company's artificial intelligence (AI)-related prospects and its ability to continue delivering eye-popping growth. Investors may be wondering if they should be buying more shares of this semiconductor giant or start booking profits. However, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia stock regaining its mojo and delivering another stellar year in 2025.\nIn this article, we will check out a couple of reasons why buying Nvidia stock before 2025 is a no-brainer.\nAnalysts are expecting Nvidia to witness a substantial increase in shipments of its AI graphics processing units (GPUs) in 2025. Market research firm TrendForce believes that Nvidia could witness a 55% increase in shipments of its AI GPUs next year, driven by the arrival of the company's next-generation Blackwell processors.\nTrendForce estimates that Blackwell will account for 80% of Nvidia's AI GPU shipments next year. This also means that the shipments of Nvidia's older generation Hopper chips will continue to remain solid as well in 2025. The good part is that TrendForce isn't the only one expecting a jump in Nvidia's AI GPU sales next year.\nJapanese investment bank Mizuho has raised its estimate for Nvidia's 2025 AI GPU shipments by 8% to 10% as compared to its prior estimate issued in July this year. Mizuho credits this upward revision to an improvement in the company's supply chain. More specifically, Nvidia's foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (popularly known as TSMC) is reportedly going to double its advanced packaging capacity, which will allow the former to manufacture more AI GPUs.\nMoreover, TSMC plans to continue increasing its advanced packaging capacity beyond next year as well. The foundry giant believes that it will be able to clock an annual growth rate of at least 60% in its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) packaging capacity through 2026. This should place Nvidia in a nice position to capitalize on the fast-growing demand for AI chips.\nAllied Market Research estimates that sales of AI chips could increase at an annual rate of 38% through 2032, generating $384 billion in annual revenue. Nvidia is the dominant player in the AI chip market with a market share that's estimated between 70% and 95%, though a closer look at its AI revenue as compared to that of its rivals will indicate that its share is likely at the higher end of that range.\nMore importantly, TSMC's improving production profile should ensure that Nvidia maintains its dominance in the AI chip market. So, higher sales of AI GPUs should translate into solid growth for Nvidia in the next fiscal year, while its pricing power in this market would lead to healthy growth in its bottom line as well.\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\nSome might point out that Nvidia is richly valued right now with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 58, which is higher than the Nasdaq-100 index's average earnings multiple of 32. But at the same time, Nvidia has been able to justify its valuation with outstanding growth. In fact, Nvidia's earnings multiple is currently lower than its five-year average P/E of 72.\nAlso, Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of just 0.14 means that the stock is very much undervalued considering the growth that it is forecasted to deliver.\nNVDA PEG Ratio data by YCharts\nThe PEG ratio is a valuation metric that takes into account the potential earnings growth that a company could deliver. A reading of less than 1 means that the said stock is undervalued. That's why now would be a good time for investors to load up on Nvidia stock before the potential jump in sales of the company's AI chips in 2025 sends it soaring.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Syeda Seirut Javed ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Best Performers List: 12 Stocks Cramer is Talking About.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other best performers on Jim Cramer's list.\nOn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer took a moment to celebrate the two-year anniversary of the current bull market. He mentioned that this particular bull market has been quiet and gentle, which he attributes to the unusual circumstances surrounding its rise. \u201cThe whole first year of this bull\u2019s life was an anomaly. That\u2019s because the Fed was furiously tightening and the market went up anyway,\u201d Cramer explained.\nHe emphasized that for the past two years, opportunities have been evident, stating, \u201cEvery night I say there\u2019s always a bull market somewhere, and for the last two years, well, it\u2019s been right in front of you.\u201d\nCramer then went on to discuss the lead performing stocks and ended the segment, saying:\n\u201cThe bottom line, if you're going to buy these stocks, I\u2019d go first with Nvidia, then with Broadcom, and finally Fair Isaac, if only because we need something that's not connected to the data center, even as we know, it will remain a strong story for the ages.\u201d\nCramer also advised investors to shift their focus away from the consumer price index (CPI) report, suggesting that its significance has diminished since the Federal Reserve began cutting rates.\n\u201cWe had to be concerned about this stuff when the Fed was on the warpath, either raising rates or leaving them higher for longer. Now, though, the Fed is your friend, so I wouldn't obsess about the details.\u201d\nHe did emphasize, however, that the monthly labor report remains important in the current climate. He remarked on the tendency for many to become \u201cFed watchers,\u201d suggesting that this reliance on government data can detract from the deeper analysis of individual companies. Cramer referenced Austan D. Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed, who advised against an overemphasis on CPI data, as the Fed is unlikely to base decisions on it. Cramer explained:\n\u201cWhen the Fed's raising rates in order to stamp out inflation, it can be very important. When we're in a rate hike cycle, you're trying to figure out when that's going to end. But we're not in that kind of cycle anymore. We're in a rate cutting cycle.\u201d\nCramer explained that last month the Fed implemented a double rate cut, setting a downward trend that is expected to continue. He added:\n\u201cSure, if we had a huge spike in the CPI this morning, then maybe the Fed would change its stance. But that would have to be an extreme reading. And there's nothing extreme about today's 2.4% inflation number, just a tick above the expected 2.3, still down from the 2.5% reading from the prior month.\u201d\nCramer concluded with a strong reminder about the nature of investing. \u201cForget the macro, people. It\u2019s not that meaningful when the Fed\u2019s cutting rates. And keep your eyes on the prize: Earnings,\u201d he urged. Ultimately, he reinforced that earnings dictate stock prices in the long run, and that\u2019s where the focus should be for those looking to make money in the market.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks with the biggest gains over the past 2 years that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nHere\u2019s what Cramer had to say about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):\n\u201cPeople are just beginning to realize that maybe it wasn't just a gaming company with some real fast graphics chips...Eventually, NVIDIA and its renaissance man, CEO Jensen, pioneered both accelerated computing and generative AI. We speak too much about the latter, not enough about the former. Accelerated computing is what makes things really work here. In other words, NVIDIA created machines that think faster than you do and soon will do almost anything better than you can do\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) initially gained widespread recognition in 1999 with the introduction of the GeForce 256, celebrated as the world's first graphics processing unit (GPU). Today, it maintains a dominant position in the GPU market, largely thanks to its A100 and H100 chipsets, which have significantly contributed to the company's record revenue and profit growth over the past few years.\nThe company's new Blackwell series GPUs are anticipated to become a major product for the company. CEO Jensen Huang recently expressed excitement about the overwhelming demand for Blackwell, commenting that interest is incredibly high and that many are eager to be at the forefront of this innovation.\nAmong the noteworthy advancements is NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) concept of \"physical AI,\" which involves the deployment of semi-autonomous robots capable of interacting in real-world environments. A significant partnership with Foxconn, the electronics supplier, is already in place to develop and train AI-driven robots.\nIn the second quarter, the company reported a remarkable 122% increase in revenue compared to the previous year, reaching $30 billion. It was fueled by a heightened demand for data center GPUs, particularly the H100 and H200 models.\nOverall NVDA ranks 2nd on Jim Cramer's list of best performing stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Johnny Rice, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's no secret that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is dominating the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, especially the massive data center segment -- think server farms built by companies like Amazon and Alphabet. Last quarter, the company brought in $26.5 billion in revenue from the lucrative segment. That's 10 times more than its biggest competitor, AMD, managed, but Nvidia isn't just selling more, it's doing so at a lower cost. In the same period, the company's net income here was a whopping 25 times that of AMD's.\nMedia attention has been focused almost entirely on this segment. It makes perfect sense; those numbers are insane. Make no mistake, data centers are the beating heart of Nvidia's explosive growth and that's not liable to change. But an exciting opportunity in AI exists outside of these colossal server farms. Your personal computer could play a crucial role in the near future.\nThat's why Nvidia is hosting its RTX AI PC Day this Oct. 19 and 20. The event will showcase how the company is incorporating AI and machine learning capabilities into its consumer-facing GPUs and the future it envisions for AI-powered PCs. What could this mean for investors?\nIn tech, the last two decades have been defined by the cloud. Advances in internet bandwidth allowed much of the actual work of computation and storage to move from your local device to sprawling server farms hidden away in mostly rural areas. Out of sight, out of mind, as they say. AI is, by and large, no different. ChatGPT doesn't run on your computer; it's likely running on Microsoft servers thousands of miles away. You're using your computer simply to communicate with it.\nHowever, that is beginning to change. In some cases, computing is moving back to the \"edge\" as the techies call it. In other words, more and more, a significant portion of computing will again happen locally on your device. Some believe this could be a big trend in AI. But why, you ask? Great question.\nSome AI applications are just too intensive to run anywhere but in a data center equipped with thousands of, say, Nvidia's H100s. At $25,000 a pop, the cost is enormous. That's why these data centers are built by companies that can invest billions of dollars to build them. However, not all AI applications need that much power. Some models, specific tools, or other limited applications of AI could run locally with a powerful enough GPU. But just because they could, does it mean they should? What advantages does edge computing have here?\nFirst, where edge computing lacks power, it makes up for it in speed. Cloud computing introduces latency into the equation -- a delay -- that crunching the numbers locally doesn't. Those milliseconds could make all the difference for some applications of the technology. Second, given the cost of building and operating large-scale data centers, using them is anything but cheap. Customers who opt for an edge approach may pay more upfront, but it could easily be the cheaper option over time. Another big one? If your internet connection isn't guaranteed or limited, you don't want to have to rely on the cloud.\nAI PCs will be used for everything from enhancing video game graphics and expanding what's possible for content creation to bringing a personal AI assistant to your car.\nThis could be a major leap for the whole PC industry. The CEO of Qualcomm called it \"as significant as Windows 95.\" No one wants to be left behind here and that means Nvidia has stiff competition from a host of other chipmakers all vying for a piece of the pie that research firm Canalys expects to grow at a 44% compound annual growth rate for the next four years. The firm believes that more than 200 million AI PCs will ship in 2028.\nGiven the competition, it may be unlikely that Nvidia will capture as much of this market as it has the data center market. Given the scale, however, it doesn't need to. A modest share of this market will still boost its bottom line significantly.\nNvidia's event will help raise the profile of AI PCs and could impact the stock price, but I wouldn't hold my breath for anything significant. The event won't move the needle in and of itself. What's important is what it represents: another massive opportunity for a company firing on all cylinders.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The firm, which already has two data centers for gaming, plans to build a third to serve generative artificial intelligence, he said.\n\u201cUnless we have other, better, efficient and cheap energy, nuclear is still the most competitive option in terms of cost and the scale of supply,\u201d Kuo said, adding that renewables like solar and wind power are too intermittent. \u201cFor industrial use \u2014 especially AI \u2014 they need a constant, high-capacity supply.\u201d\nUbitus, which received funding from Nvidia earlier this year, joins a growing list of tech companies at the forefront of a global revival in nuclear power, as use of AI and data centers drives up demand for emissions-free, stable electricity. Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp. are among the giants that have recently made investments to gain access to atomic energy.\nHowever, securing nuclear power in Japan remains challenging given sensitivities over the 2011 Fukushima disaster and the strict regulatory framework put in place in its aftermath. The country now has 33 commercially operable reactors left, but many remain idle.\nUbitus aims to select a location for its new data center during the first quarter of next year, Kuo said, adding he has visited sites in Kyoto and Shimane, with plans to travel to Kyushu as well. The firm already operates two data centers for gaming in Japan, in partnership with Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp.\nSetting up a data center in these areas would allow access to a grid with cheap and stable electricity thanks to the nuclear facilities, said Kuo. That\u2019s a slightly different approach from the US tech giants, which have been signing deals to directly purchase power from or build nuclear plants.\nJapanese regions with nuclear power plants, like the western Kansai area and Kyushu, generally have lower electricity rates.\nKyoto is close to several nuclear power plants operated by Kansai Electric Power Co., while Kyushu is home to four units managed by Kyushu Electric Power Co. Chugoku Electric Power Co. is scheduled to restart its Shimane No. 2 reactor in December.\nThe cloud-based gaming services provider was originally founded in Taiwan in 2007, and is now based in Tokyo, with partners including Nintendo Co. Its existing data centers are located in Tokyo and Osaka to be close to gaming clients. But for generative AI, the priority becomes more about the size of energy supply and electricity price, Kuo said.\nUbitus will aim for its new data center to have power-receiving capacity of 2-3 megawatts in the initial phase of the operation, with plans to potentially expand to up to 50 megawatts, he added.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAI Detectors Falsely Accuse Students of Cheating\u2014With Big Consequences\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs\nNeuralink Co-Founder\u2019s New Startup Sells a Brain Computer Toolkit\nA Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work\nHow Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Anthony Lee ",
        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 6.8% in the morning session as semiconductor stocks fell after ASML, the biggest supplier of equipment used in making advanced chips, pre-announced weak earnings. ASML expects fiscal year 2025 sales to come in between 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros, at the lower half of the range it had previously provided. Similarly, bookings for the quarter are reportedly below expectations. Reuters noted that the quarterly earnings numbers were mistakenly published a day earlier than expected.\nManagement noted that while the potential in the AI (artificial intelligence) market remained strong, other markets were taking too long to recover, with the observed trend expected to continue into 2025.\nLastly, ASML's CFO Roger Dassen projected China's contribution to overall revenue to be around 20% (down from the recent estimate of 49%), hinting at potential weakness in the region.\nASML's technology is used by chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and Samsung to make advanced chips, including those specially designed for AI workloads. Given the company's critical role in the semiconductor manufacturing process, the weak earnings and outlook could signal a possible softening in the industry.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\nNvidia\u2019s shares are very volatile and have had 24 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 26 days ago when the stock gained 5.2% as markets roared back after an initially muted response to the Fed's rate cut, which sparked a renewed appetite for risk assets. While investors were expecting a reduction in rates from the US central bank, there was a bit of back and forth on whether the cut would be 25bps (a quarter percent) or 50bps (half a percent). The Fed ended up slashing its policy rate by 50bps (0.5%) to 4.75%-5.00%. This marks the first rate reduction in roughly four years.\nThe Fed\u2014under Chair Jerome Powell\u2014began raising rates to tackle inflation coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic when a confluence of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending caused inflation to run hot. Looking forward, the Fed signaled that more cuts are possible in 2024/25.\nPutting it all together, the announcement and outlook provided a breath of fresh air and a clearer view of the Fed's monetary policy stance, which the market has been waiting for with bated breath. If there's anything the market doesn't like, it's uncertainty.\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. The result of lower interest rates, all else equal, is higher stock valuations. This is especially true for higher-growth stocks such as those in the technology sector, where the current value depends more on cash flows many years out in the future.\nNvidia is up 174% since the beginning of the year, and at $131.93 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $138.07 from October 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $26,870.\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n"

We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 62.81x is currently well-above the industry average of 28.79x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since NVIDIA\u2019s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? NVDA\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NVDA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nKeep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. For example, we've found that NVIDIA has 2 warning signs (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.\nIf you are no longer interested in NVIDIA, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock: Buy at the High?",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is one of the S&P 500 index's top performers so far this year, heading for a gain of nearly 180%. The stock even reached its highest ever in recent days. This isn't surprising considering Nvidia's dominant position in the high-growth artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the fastest around, and customers have flocked to the company for these chips as well as a broad variety of other AI products and services.\nAll of this has equaled mind-boggling earnings growth for Nvidia. The company has reported quarter after quarter of triple-digit revenue and profit gains. And it looks as if this is set to continue, considering a key product launch on the horizon and outsize demand for that and other Nvidia products.\nDoes this earnings momentum and future potential mean you should buy Nvidia at the high -- or is it time to approach this top AI player with caution? Let's find out.\nFirst a bit of background on Nvidia. The company has progressively increased earnings over time, initially focusing on the video game market and then broadening its reach into other industries. The AI boom helped earnings truly take off, as Nvidia's GPUs emerged as the \"go-to\" tool for crucial tasks such as the training and inferencing of models.\nAs a result, Nvidia's recent quarterly revenue surpassed the company's annual revenue as recently as fiscal 2023. And in the latest quarter, Nvidia reported record revenue of $30 billion, with 87% of that coming from the data center business. (Data center includes Nvidia's AI activities.)\nLooking ahead, great potential exists for more growth, and this is thanks to a launch on the horizon as well as Nvidia's ongoing focus on innovation. The company has developed a new architecture known as Blackwell along with its highest-performance chip ever and five other game-changing innovations. The company says it plans on ramping production in the fourth quarter and expects \"several billion dollars\" of revenue to start flowing in during the period.\nNvidia has reason to be so optimistic because demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply even as the company works day and night to try to keep up. And the tech giant expects this trend to continue into next year. At the same time, demand for earlier architecture, Hopper, remains strong as well. This should result in solid revenue growth in the coming quarters.\nAnd this should extend well beyond the launch of the new Blackwell architecture thanks to Nvidia's pledge to update its chips on an annual basis. So, if Nvidia follows that plan, it suggests the company won't be in a position of weakness, and instead will continue building on its strengths before rivals have the time to catch up.\nOf course, there's always the possibility that a new player will come up with another way of powering AI tasks -- and this could threaten Nvidia's dominance. For example, Cerebras Systems, a company planning an initial public offering, has launched a technology that could rival Nvidia's GPUs. But, even if this and other small companies have a promising product, it won't be easy to upset Nvidia's leadership position. Nvidia has spent years winning the confidence of its customers by delivering top-performing products -- so they may not easily switch to a younger rival with a shorter track record of success.\nNow, let's get back to our question. Should you buy Nvidia at the high or view the stock with caution? I favor buying at the high for a couple of reasons. First, Nvidia may have reached a record high, but the stock still remains reasonably priced considering the company's track record and long-term prospects. It trades for 48x forward earnings estimates.\nSecond, since we are looking at this investment through a long-term lens, it means we'll hold on for at least five years (and possibly much longer). And in that time period, it's very likely Nvidia stock will head higher thanks to demand for its products, its innovation, and overall growth in the AI market.\nSo, I don't think that, here at this record level, Nvidia has reached its full potential. And that means there's reason to be optimistic about this top AI player and buy and hold for the long run.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Syeda Seirut Javed ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on the Magnificent Seven Stocks Plus Netflix.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other magnificent stocks in Jim Cramer's list.\nOn Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique \"Poltergeist 2 magic.\"\nCramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zero-sum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market.\n\u201cUnlike previous Mag 7 rallies, this one\u2019s definitely not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can roar, too, in this market, perhaps because there\u2019s just a lot of money going around.\u201d\nHe noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable.\n\u201cWe know these stocks will once again be hit by endless worries, giving you more opportunities to buy and more weakness before they snap right back and start climbing all over again.\u201d\nCramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial four-week earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added:\n\u201cWhy stress about how quickly the Fed will cut rates, Oh? God, I'm sick of that. What matters is they're giving vast swaths of the economy a big boost and I doubt they'll stop anytime soon.\u201d\nCramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nCramer has been highly bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and mentioned the growing demand for the super chip, Blackwell. Here is what he had to say:\n\u201cNow initially, NVIDIA got clubbed along with the whole market when the yen carry trade imploded. Then it came right back because that was only a temporary problem. Then NVIDIA got smacked down after its quarter, although it didn't take out the blows from the previous sell-off. It's been working its way back ever since. As we learned that demand for its next-generation super chip Blackwell is \u2018insane\u2019, that's a technical term coined by Jensen, by the way. Next thing you know, the stock's coming all the way back, but back with very few people who sold the stock. And before this, right, I mean they're long gone and gone at much lower levels because they traded it, they sold it. Again, take this as a reminder that if you trade NVIDIA, you probably won't be able to sell it high and then get back in low. The ship would've left without you. It's too hard, people, it's just too hard.\u201d\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has emerged as a dominant force in the technology sector, particularly in AI. Over recent years, investor interest in the company has surged, positioning it among the largest corporations globally. Additionally, on October 14, as reported by TipRanks, TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a target price of $165. He has designated the stock as a Top Pick and Buchalter noted a significant increase in the volumes of the Hopper architecture expected in the latter part of 2024, which could contribute to sustained growth and potentially better profit margins.\nWhile he acknowledged some short-term hurdles tied to the evolving supply chain of the Blackwell product line, the enduring demand for these platforms remains strong. Any production delays are anticipated to shift revenue expectations from the first quarter to later in the year, without diminishing the overall demand.\nMost importantly, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has reported that its Blackwell platforms are now fully operational, suggesting that prior production challenges have been effectively addressed. With units priced between $30,000 and $40,000, major corporations such as Microsoft and Meta are actively seeking these products to support their AI data centers.\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

Indeed, with a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is now the second most valuable U.S. company, behind only Apple.\nAt the center of it all is Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, now himself worth an estimated $121.5 billion, per Forbes. The ride looks to continue, too. Alongside continuing demand for its current chips, Huang said earlier this month Nvidia is seeing \"insane\" demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips, which are slated to roll out in the fourth quarter. According to Morgan Stanley, which recently hosted meetings with Huang and other Nvidia execs, the chips are already sold out for the next 12 months.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/nvidia-the-ai-chipmaker-just-hit-another-record-high/\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks.\u00a0Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer during his October 14 program on CNBC looked excited as he celebrated the rebound of major tech stocks, saying these companies are showing their \u201cstaying power\u201d despite the odds.\n\u201cWe\u2019re back. That\u2019s right. Whatever you want to call them, these big tech plays are demonstrating their staying power no matter what happens.\u201d\nCramer said that the latest earnings season would be critical for the overall market and investor portfolios. He also pointed out the broadening of the rally, saying other groups besides the tech industry are also rebounding.\n\u201cThis rally is not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can work, too, in this market. There\u2019s a lot of money going around, and we know there\u2019s a lot of money coming into the market. The Fed is cutting rates, and friendly cash won\u2019t be worth as much as it was. But the staying power of the Magnificent 7 is truly unbelievable.\u201d\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 important stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nTalking about Nvidia in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer talked about the much-awaited Blackwell chips:\n\u201cThey are so powerful, so fast. These guys basically invented a chip that is so quick that it created the entire AI business out of thin air. It wasn\u2019t possible before, but now it can do incredible things, and very soon it will be both faster and better.\u201d\nCramer also talked about the demand NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is seeing:\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a company have such demand for its products, including demand from Tesla, which needs NVIDIA for self-driving cars.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\nAt Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\nOf course, Nvidia won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cOver the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\u201d\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio Update: Top 10 Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Huang and Nvidia are creating something out of nothing, exploring new opportunities rather than competing with others in well-established businesses.\nDon't Miss:\nThis Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nAs Huang puts it, \u201cI\u2019d rather be a market maker, market creator than a market taker.\u201d Because of his daring business plan, Nvidia has become the second most valuable corporation in the world.\nHuang calls these new spaces \u201czero-billion-dollar markets.\u201d These are markets that have not yet attracted investors or rivals because no one has investigated or invested in them. Although it sounds risky, this is a wonderful strategy for staying one step ahead of the competition.\n\u201cEverything that we do didn\u2019t exist before,\u201d Huang said in a conversation with Jim Cramer, emphasizing that Nvidia's mission is to create opportunities, not just follow existing trends.\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nIn the early 2000s, Huang took a big risk by investing in \u201caccelerated computing\u201d with CUDA technology. Back then, nobody was buying GPUs for AI computing because AI, as we know it today, didn\u2019t exist. But he saw the potential for GPUs to do more than just improve video games.

Nvidia had to put in years of arduous work and money to get to the top. Failure is also a necessary part of the process; not every concept will pan out. However, there might be enormous rewards for those ready to take chances. As Huang said, \u201cThe market size is enormous. It\u2019s measured in trillions,\u201d Nvidia is well-positioned to take a sizable portion of it.\nTrending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nIn the same interview, Huang also discussed making technology accessible to everyone, even those without technical backgrounds. \u201cWe are going to make computers smarter so people don\u2019t have to learn computer science to program a computer. The computer should just understand what we want and intend,\u201d he said. This reflects Nvidia's vision of making technology easier for people without specialized skills.\nWhen Cramer asked him why some people are so scared of AI and losing their jobs, Huang answered that it will create jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make companies more productive. When companies are more productive, their earnings improve. When that happens, they hire more people,\u201d Huang pointed out.\nTrending:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion \u2013 they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here\u2019s how you can earn passive income with just $100.\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

The latter is a key Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) and other technology companies supplier, and its shares rose 13% after the company posted better-than-expected Q3 numbers and raised Q4 revenue guidance. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financial) also was up 1%.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with TSM.\nThe market's uplift was driven not only by positive data from the commodities front but also by new data that reported ongoing consumer strength in the economy. Retail sales for the month of September were higher than estimations, with a 0.4% increase on a forecasted 0.3%. Excluding autos, sales increased by 0.5%, which is much higher than the expected 0.1%. Also, new applications for unemployment benefits for the week ended October 12 also declined, sealing the robust economy.\nSimplify Asset Management Chief Strategist Michael Green pointed to the market's bounce back more as a sign that things are getting back to normal than an actual shift towards better fortunes for the economy. He pointed out that although the figures looked robust on the face of it, seasonality was an influencing factor and the raw numbers are not very dynamic on a year-on-year basis. However, the current market trend can be stated as optimistic or bullish, pointing to the fact that investors remain optimistic regardless of constantly changing market signals.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock? Evidence Is Piling Up That Provides a Compelling Answer.",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There are no two ways about it: The dawn of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in early 2023 has been a windfall for chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that have become the gold standard for a variety of use cases by providing the computational horsepower needed to underpin video games, data centers, and even earlier versions of AI.\nGenerative AI went viral early last year, with Nvidia at the heart of what many are calling the next industrial revolution. The results have been striking: Nvidia stock is up more than 800% since the start of 2023 and hovers less than 2% off its all-time high (as of this writing) -- but it's been a bumpy ride. Nvidia stock lost as much as 27% during the four weeks starting in early July but has rebounded vigorously, gaining nearly all that back over the past month.\nCausing the recent decline were fears that demand for AI could dwindle, and a great deal of future growth was already baked into the stock price. That said, there's mounting evidence that answers the question: Is it too late to buy Nvidia stock?\nWhat distinguishes generative AI from its predecessors is the need for not only massive amounts of data, but also the corresponding computational horsepower needed to parse the data. When it comes to AI-centric processors, Nvidia is without equal, controlling an estimated 98% of the market in 2023, similar to its share in 2022, according to semiconductor analyst company TechInsights. This dominance put Nvidia in pole position when generative AI burst on the scene.\nThe unprecedented demand fueled triple-digit revenue and profit growth for Nvidia for five successive quarters. So, when the company forecast only 79% growth for its fiscal 2025 third quarter (which ends in late October), some investors saw the writing on the wall. They concluded that demand was ebbing and they headed for the exits, but that move was likely premature -- and costly. The evidence is growing that demand for AI continues unabated.\nSuper Micro Computer, commonly called Supermicro, provided one piece to the demand puzzle on Monday. In a press release, the company revealed that it had delivered more than 2,000 direct liquid-cooling (DLC) rack systems since June and was currently shipping more than 100,000 GPUs per quarter. Shipments of that magnitude suggest that demand for Nvidia's GPUs remains robust.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang provided some boots-on-the-ground commentary as well. In an interview late last week, the chief executive said that demand for Blackwell -- the company's next-generation AI platform -- is \"insane.\" He called this the \"first wave of AI,\" which started with the modernization of $1 trillion worth of existing data centers, upgrading them with chips capable of processing generative AI. Huang went on to say that the next phase -- the \"biggest wave of AI\" -- will involve \"companies using AI to be more productive.\" These comments suggest that the AI boom has only just begun.\nFurthermore, Nvidia recently expanded its partnership with global IT consultancy company Accenture\u00a0to help enterprise companies \"rapidly scale their AI adoption.\" To that end, Accenture launched the new Accenture Nvidia Business Group, which will be staffed by 30,000 business professionals to help customers with \"process reinvention, AI-powered simulation, and sovereign AI.\" Accenture noted in the press release that generative AI drove $3 billion in bookings in its recently completed fiscal year and shows no signs of slowing.\nFinally, data provided on Wednesday by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, commonly called TSMC, left no question about the ongoing demand for AI. The company released its September Revenue Report, which reported quarterly revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($24.6 billion), increasing 39% year over year and coasting past Wall Street's consensus estimate of NT$748. Nvidia is one of TSMC's largest customers, accounting for roughly 11% of sales last year. This suggests that AI-related demand remains strong for Nvidia as well.\nNvidia investors have been on a non-stop thrill ride since early last year. The company's fiscal 2025 second-quarter results help illustrate its success. For the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), Nvidia delivered record revenue that grew 122% year over year to $30 billion, fueled by record data center revenue of $26.3 billion, up 154%. Profits also soared as diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.67 surged 168%.\nNvidia won't report its fiscal third-quarter results until late November, so we won't know for sure until then. However, if the latest developments are any indication, Nvidia should have another strong showing in the works.\nThe company's forecast is calling for revenue of $32.5 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 79%, with a corresponding increase in profitability. While that's slower than the triple-digit growth investors had become accustomed to, it's remarkable nonetheless.\nThen there's the matter of Nvidia's valuation. At 62 times earnings, it certainly appears expensive -- at least at first glance. However, Wall Street is forecasting EPS of $4.02 for Nvidia's fiscal year that begins in January. That works out a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33, which is only slightly higher than the multiple of 30 for the S&P 500.\nFor me, the evidence is clear: Nvidia stock is still a buy.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Text": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) notched a record high closing price as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom, placing the chipmaker in contention for the top spot as Wall Street's most valuable company.\nShares rose 2.4% Monday to above $138. Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. \nNvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains.\nThe stock\u2019s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips.\nNvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by an abundance of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs \u201cremains extremely robust.\u201d A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia\u2019s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday.\nNvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan\u2019s largest supercomputer during Foxconn\u2019s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it\u2019s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia\u2019s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions.\nNvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday after market close, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year.\nNvidia\u2019s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company\u2019s second quarter earnings.\nShares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China due to rising trade tensions with the US had also driven shares down. Nvidia\u2019s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June.\nOther recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations \u2014 another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term.\n\u201cAI is hot,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, \u201cI see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.\u201d\nThe chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech\u2019s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown.\nSemiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia\u2019s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet \u201ccrazy\u201d demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell chips has been \u201cinsane.\u201d\nNvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the\u00a010 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.\nVolatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market.\nA report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds\u00a0and\u00a0David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy.\nWhile expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells.\nThe economist maintains we are marching on ice that\u2019s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.\u201d\n\u201cBut there\u2019s been some cracks in the business cycle,\u201d he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at \u201csuper high\u201d levels.\nA slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election.\nWhile the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around.\n\u201cHistorically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,\u201d Cohen said.\nAlthough there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows.\nAI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta\u2019s share price surge due to strong sales growth.\nAnalysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst\u2019s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 179\nAnalyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 15.32%\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is arguably one of the most promising future stocks, according to analysts, given the role it is playing in artificial intelligence, which is only starting. With so many companies relying on its chips to power next-generation technologies and software, its growth metrics and long-term prospects remain intact.\nGiven that artificial intelligence adoption is still in the early stages, it affirms Nvidia\u2019s long-term prospects as a leading player in the supply of much-needed chips for AI. Given that graphic processing units are preferred for their flexibility and adaptability in the evolving AI applications, it also affirms the company\u2019s growth metrics.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) financial statements show the company\u2019s explosive growth in recent years. Its net income over the last four reported quarters has exceeded $53 billion. That\u2019s almost twice as much as the $26.9 billion it made in fiscal 2022, which concluded on January 30, 2022, before all the AI hoopla started. It made $9.8 billion in profit during that fiscal year.\nThe enormous demand for Nvidia\u2019s data center graphics processing units (GPUs), which aid in the execution and training of AI algorithms, caused the company\u2019s second-quarter revenue to soar 122% year over year to $30 billion.\nThe company\u2019s bottom line is likewise strong, with operating income rising 174% yearly to $18.6 million. In 2025 and beyond, management anticipates introducing new AI hardware products built on the quicker and more effective Blackwell architecture will boost customer demand.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s revenue base is poised to receive a significant boost later in the year with the launch of the Blackwell cap line. Given that the chipset is already eliciting sand demand, according to Coo Jensen Huang, it underscores why Nvidia is a top growth stock.\nThanks to robust revenue and earnings growth, the stock is currently trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 31, which is not high for a stock that has rallied by more than 26,000%. Analysts on Wall Street rate the stock as a buy with an average price target of $152.44, implying a 15.32% change from the last price of $132.19.\nAccording to our Insider Monkey database, at the close of Q2 2024, 179 investors were bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), with total stakes amounting to $53.7 billion.\nIthaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d\nOverall NVDA\u00a0ranks 9th\u00a0on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "US stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors reacted to downbeat earnings from ASML Holding (ASML) that dropped a day earlier than expected, sending chipmaker stocks lower across the board.\nShares of the leading semiconductor supplier sank more than 15% after its earnings, released in an apparent error, showed a disappointing sales outlook for 2025. Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell in tandem, dropping around 5% to slip back from their freshly minted high. AMD (AMD) stock also dipped 5%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged down about 0.8%, or more than 300 points, on the heels of closing above 43,000 for the first time. The blue-chip index was dragged down by UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which saw shares fall around 8% after its 2025 profit guidance missed estimates.\nMeanwhile, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) also dropped roughly 0.8% to fall from Monday's all-time high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank around 1%.\nInvestors also assessed a fresh crop of bank earnings before the bell with Goldman Sachs (GS) reporting a 45% surge in third quarter profit from a year ago, thanks to a rise in dealmaking. Similarly, Bank of America's (BAC) posted an earnings beat amid its own outperformance in investment banking.\nAs the rush of earnings starts to broaden out, hopes are for further positive surprises in what some on Wall Street suspect could be a tricky season. Shares in Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) finished the day up around 15% higher on the heels of its plan to shut 1,200 stores over three years, as the pharmacy chain pursues a turnaround.\nOutside of earnings, energy was another major focus. Oil prices tumbled roughly 4% on a report that Israel is prepared to refrain from bombarding Iran's crude and nuclear facilities in its response to an attack two weeks ago. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CL=F) sank to just under $71 a barrel, while Brent crude futures (BZ=F) fell to around $74.50 following the Washington Post report.\nUnited Airlines (UAL) reported third quarter financials on Tuesday that beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending the stock about 1% higher in after-hours trading.\nAdjusted earnings hit $3.33 per share in the quarter, while revenue rose 2.5% year over year to $14.84 billion.\nThe airliner also announced its first stock buyback since before the pandemic. It plans to purchase $1.5 billion worth of shares.\n\"I appreciate the entire United team coming together to take care of our customers by operating a safe and on-time airline this summer,\" United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said in the earnings release.\n\"As predicted, unproductive capacity left the market in mid-August, and we saw a clear inflection point in our revenue trends that propelled United to exceed Q3 expectations,\" he added. \"A prosperous summer 2024 is just the beginning as our improved customer experience combined with United Next positions the airline at the top of the industry for the foreseeable future.\"\nUS stocks closed in a sea of red on Tuesday, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which was dragged down by chipmakers including Nvidia (NVDA) and ASML Holding (ASML).\nThe Nasdaq Composite sank around 1%, while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) each dropped roughly 0.8% to fall from their previous all-time highs.\nOn Tuesday, in speech titled \"Landing Softly Is Just the Beginning,\" San Francisco Federal Reserve president Mary Daly called on a chart that showed the post-pandemic economic expansion could have room to run further.\nAt this point, the current economic expansion has been underway for 54 months, well short of the expansions that were seen starting in 1982, 1991, 2001, and 2009.\nWhile speaking at New York University on Tuesday, Daly noted that the Fed's work to achieve a \"soft landing\" isn't fully done, but the trajectory of the economy after inflation falls to 2% will remain just as important.\n\"We must strive for a world where people aren't worried about inflation or the economy,\" Daly said.\nDaly added, \"No matter which expansion you look at ... the message is the same. Sustained expansion helps all Americans.\"\nThis speaks to the growing conversation following the hot September jobs report about whether or not further economic expansion could impact the Fed's fight against inflation. \nDaly told Yahoo Finance that a pickup in labor market data isn't necessarily inflationary in and of itself.\n\"That's a fear more than a fact,\" Daly said.\nFor now, her check-ins with firms reveal that consumers are less willing to pay higher prices and customers are continuing to trade down and look for value. This would point to an economy that's still seeing consumers spending, but not necessarily one that's fueling a resurgence in inflation.\n\"This is not an environment where firms are looking to raise prices,\" Daly said. \"They're looking to grow, but they're not looking to raise prices.\"\nTrading in Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) was briefly halted on Tuesday due to volatility.\nShares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, suddenly plunged around 5% in late afternoon trading after extending previous gains by more than 13% earlier in the session.\nIt is unclear what exactly caused the abrupt drop in share price, although it was an incredibly high-volume trading session.\nThe former president spoke with Bloomberg News at the Economic Club of Chicago earlier in the day. He argued for more US tariffs, calling \"tariff the \"most beautiful word in the dictionary.\"\nIt's a big earnings week for markets, with United Airlines (UAL), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Netflix (NFLX) still left to report quarterly results.\nNetflix, set to report after the market close on Thursday, will have a high bar to overcome as the stock trades near record highs and analysts predict another price hike across its various streaming tiers.\nNetflix is expected to report earnings of $5.16 per share on revenue of $9.78 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. This would represent nearly 40% earnings growth compared to the prior year.\nInvestors have praised the company's foray into sports and live events. Meanwhile, its ad tier continues to gain traction. Shares have soared as a result, with the stock up about 45% since the start of the year.\nLast week, the stock secured another all-time closing high of around $730 a share. It's since retreated to trade closer to $710 a share. But the recent run-up has led to some apprehension on Wall Street.\n\"We expect Netflix\u2019s stock to trade higher on a US price hike announcement,\" Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a note to clients. \"But we would expect shares to eventually trade lower as investor\u2019s hopes for $25 in 2025 EPS are dashed.\"\nFor the full year, Netflix's earnings are projected to rise about 60% year over year to $19.10 per share, while full-year revenue of $38.75 billion would mark an increase of about 15% on a yearly basis.\nIn 2025, analysts anticipate full-year earnings to rise to $23 with revenue jumping to $43.46 billion.\nWall Street strategists keep growing more bullish on the stock market rally.\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, UBS Investment Bank equity strategist Jonathan Golub boosted his year-end target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2024 and 2025. Golub now sees the benchmark index ending this year at 5,850, from a prior target of 5,600. In 2025, Golub projects the S&P 500 will end the year at 6,400, up from a prior target of 6,000.\nGolub notes the economic backdrop is \"supportive,\" with growth data proving resilient, the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, and recession risk falling by the wayside. He sees further upside for the benchmark index as inflation falls, providing room for further easing from the Fed.\nGolub added that given the positive backdrop, in an upside scenario, small-business activity should \"improve\" this, leading to \"broad-based profit strength, loan performance and credit spreads driving valuations higher.\"\nApple (AAPL) stock hit a new intraday high of $237.49 on Tuesday, eclipsing its prior record of $237.23 on July 15. The stock's climb added about $70 billion to its market capitalization, putting it further ahead of Nvidia (NVDA) as the world's most valuable company after Nvidia's gains jeopardized the iPhone maker's lead.\nThe stock pared gains after notching the record, gaining about 1.5% in afternoon trading. Meanwhile, Nvidia fell around 4%.\nApple's upward move comes a day after preliminary data showed rising demand for iPhones in the third quarter. Global iPhone shipments rose 3.5% from last year, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC).\n\"While the growth of the Chinese players in emerging markets has been an ongoing theme this year, Apple also enjoyed a 3.5% YoY growth in shipments this quarter fueled by strong demand from the previous models and the launch of the new iPhone 16 lineup,\" said Nabila Popal, IDC's data & analytics senior director, in a statement Monday.\n\"Despite the staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence in markets outside the U.S., Apple will continue to grow in the upcoming holiday season,\" she added.\nApple released its new iPad mini, which is equipped to run its suite of AI features, on Tuesday.\nApple is set to report earnings Oct. 31, and Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg expect earnings to rise 9% from last year to $1.59 per share. Some 40 analysts recommend buying the stock, while 19 have a Hold rating and two recommend selling shares, according to Bloomberg data. Apple shares are up 32% from last year, and analysts see the stock rising further to over $245 over the next 12 months, Bloomberg data shows.\nNvidia (NVDA) shares sank more than 5% Tuesday, partially reversing its two week-rally and coming down from a record close the day before.\nThe stock's tumble comes after a Bloomberg report that Biden administration officials are considering capping US chip exports to certain countries. Citing unnamed sources, Bloomberg reported that potential regulations would focus on Persian Gulf countries in the interest of national security. The stocks of fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC) also fell, responding to the Bloomberg report and a dismal earnings report from semiconductor supplier ASML (ASML).\nNvidia stock has been more volatile since its 10-for-1 stock split in June, and news of heightened trade tensions focused on the AI chip sector \u2014 which Nvidia leads \u2014 have pushed shares down various times over the past two years. For example, Nvidia shares experienced a similar decline this time last year \u2014 when the Biden administration tightened export controls on US chips \u2014 before extending its historic rally.\nNvidia shares are up around 191% from last year.\nA surprise earnings report from ASML Holding (ASML) sent stocks lower across the board on Tuesday.\nShares of the leading semiconductor supplier sank around 15% after its earnings, released in an apparent error, showed a disappointing sales outlook for 2025. Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell in tandem, dropping around 4% to slip back from their freshly minted high. AMD (AMD) stock dropped 4%.\nThe moves erased prior gains of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which fell around 0.8%. As a result, the tech sector was one of the biggest laggards of the day, down nearly 2%.\nOil tumbled as much as 5% on Tuesday as supply fears faded after a media report signaled Israel would avoid targeting Iran\u2019s petroleum production. A glut of supply forecasted by the International Energy Agency also weighed on prices.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) dropped to hover near $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, fell below $74.\nPrices declined after a Washington Post article stated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Biden Administration Tel Aviv would avoid targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear and oil facilities when it retaliates for the ballistic missile attack earlier this month.\n\"Overall right now, its a bit of a bearish outlook for oil given china's economy and given Middle East tensions aren't escalating at this moment,\" GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis Patrick De Haan told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday morning.\nBoeing stock edged up close to 0.4% after filing paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday to issue shares of debt securities and common stock worth up to $25 billion over the next three years in a bid to generate much-needed cash.\nSeparately, the aircraft manufacturer said Tuesday that it has entered a $10 billion credit agreement.\nBoeing has had a chaotic year, beginning with a Jan. 5 incident in which an airplane part called a door plug blew off of one of its 737 Maxes \u2014 and set off a series of regulatory probes that revealed underlying safety issues at the company and led to the resignation of its CEO. Then, last month, 33,000 Boeing workers walked off the job, seeking access to pension plans, job security, safety improvements, and higher wages. The strike, which crossed the one-month mark on Sunday, has cost the company and workers an estimated $5 billion, according to a report by Anderson Economic Group reviewed by CNN.\nBoeing shares are down 42.6% from the start of the year.\nThe company is at risk of an S&P credit downgrade to junk, Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferr\u00e9 reports. Shares most recently slid last Friday after Boeing said it would cut its workforce by 10% and delay its first delivery of its 777X jet to 2026, Ferr\u00e9 wrote.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) index traded near its all-time high early Tuesday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose roughly 0.2%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dipped about 0.6% on the heels of closing above 43,000 for the first time as markets assessed a fresh wave of earnings.\nWhat's largely responsible for the drag on the Dow? UnitedHealth Group (UNH). The company saw shares fall nearly 10% after its 2025 profit guidance missed estimates.\nA fresh batch of bank earnings rolled in Tuesday morning, with strong quarterly results from Goldman Sachs (GS), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), PNC (PNC), and State Street (STT) lifting the market.\nHere are some of the highlights:\nHealthcare stocks moved in different directions following mixed results. Here's a look:\nNot to be outdone by Big Lots and True Value recently announcing they were going bankrupt, Walgreens (WBA) is back in focus today with its now-normal dose of bad news.\nThe drugstore chain said this morning it will close 1,200 stores over the next three years. That's a huge number, one that says a lot about the company's struggles over the last two years.\nThese numbers from Yahoo Finance shed further light on Walgreens' problems:\nAnother big morning for the banks on the investment banking front.\nGoldman Sachs (GS) delivered a 20% increase in its investment banking fees in the third quarter. Bank of America (BAC) also notched a 20% increase. Citi's (C) investment banking revenue grew 31%.\nLast week, JPMorgan (JPM) showed a 31% year-over-year increase.\nIs there a year-end advisory boom ahead of the November election as CEOs plot out their next five years? Could be. But there could also be a lot of companies preparing to IPO in 2025 amid near-record markets and the prospect of lower interest rates.\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia(NVDA, Financial) ended at an unprecedented high on Monday, bringing it within close distance of Apple (AAPL,Financial) as the most valuable company in the world. The economic value of Nvidia is at $3.39 trillion and thus, it is behind Apple's $3.52 trillion only, but ahead of Microsoft's $3.12 trillion. This jump attests to solid investors' belief in Nvidia's present and future AI chip products.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nEarlier this year, Nividia briefly surpassed Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) to become the world's most valuable company. Nevertheless, the tech giants have since repositioned themselves thoroughly, and their market caps bounced around with more fluctuation for several more months.\nIndeed, Wall Street has placed Nvidia among critical contenders for the position of the market leader for next-gen AI tech, manufacturers of which include Alphabet (GOOGL, Financial), Amazon (AMZN, Financial), and Microsoft. TD Cowen analysts indicate that the investment environment in the AI space is competitive and calls for more Australia's needs to invest continuously, which investment is critical in preparing for potential obstacles in the burgeoning field.\nNvidia expects further sales growth even if it experiences a production slowdown of the Blackwell chips it is expected to release. Sales of other chips for artificial intelligence deployments are expected to remain steady at least. TD Cowen has placed Nvidia as their Top Pick for investment, and the firm reaffirms its price target of $165.\nBefore the reporting season starts emotions are also rather high: both Apple and Microsoft have increased their movements which led to S&P 500 record. Nvidia along with companies like Apple and Microsoft jointly hold appreciable weight at the S&P 500.\nAs we look ahead, Nvidia has forecasted revenue surge to almost $125.8 billion thanks to continued investments in AI data centres, according to LSEG data. Still, there is some wariness regarding the further stable growth of AI spending.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Prediction: 2 Hypergrowth Stocks That Will Run Circles Around Nvidia Through 2030",
        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Last week, Wall Street's bull market celebrated its two-year anniversary. Although a resilient U.S. economy and stock-split euphoria have played important roles in lifting all three major stock indexes to record highs, arguably nothing has been more pivotal to the success of equities than the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nThe ability for AI-driven software and systems to learn and evolve without the need for human intervention gives this technology seemingly limitless potential. Last year, the analysts at PwC pegged this global opportunity at $15.7 trillion by 2030 in their report, Sizing the Prize.\nConsidering the addressable market for AI, it's not surprising to see semiconductor titan Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) delivering record-breaking returns to its shareholders. Since 2023 began, shares of the company have catapulted more than 820%, with its market cap expanding by close to $3 trillion.\nHowever, near-parabolic moves higher -- especially for market-leading businesses -- are rarely, if ever, sustainable. It's my prediction that two other hypergrowth stocks have the tools and intangibles needed to run circles around Nvidia in the return column through 2030.\nNvidia's claim to fame is its hardware. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have rapidly become a staple in AI-accelerated data centers. The semiconductor analysts at TechInsights estimate Nvidia accounted for 98% of GPU shipments to enterprise data centers in 2022 and 2023.\nThere's strong reason to believe Wall Street's AI darling retained the lion's share of AI-GPU shipments this year, as well. Orders for the ultra-popular H100 are backlogged, and CEO Jensen Huang recently called demand for the successor Blackwell chip, \"insane.\"\nBut there are challenges Nvidia is set to face that simply don't justify the company sustaining a nearly $3 trillion increase in market cap, let alone a higher valuation.\nHistory might be the biggest hurdle Nvidia will have to overcome. Including the advent of the internet, there hasn't been a next-big-thing technology or innovation for three decades that's avoided an early stage bubble. Investors have consistently overestimated the adoption of game-changing innovations and technologies, and there's nothing to suggest this won't be the case with artificial intelligence. If the AI bubble does burst, Nvidia's stock would undoubtedly be hit hard.\nThere are also competitive pressures that need to be taken into account. While it's a well-known fact that rivals like Advanced Micro Devices are ramping production of AI-GPUs and introducing new chips, the bigger threat to Nvidia's bottom line is likely to come from within.\nNvidia's four-largest customers by net sales are all internally developing AI-GPUs for their data centers. Despite these chips being inferior to the computing capabilities of Nvidia's GPUs, they're going to be significantly cheaper and easier to access. Remember, Nvidia's chips are backlogged due to high demand. Internal AI-GPU development from the company's core customers likely means it'll lose out on valuable data center real estate in the years to come.\nNvidia's stock is currently priced for perfection in a world where things are rarely perfect. Instead of wagering on Nvidia's stock to head higher, I predict the following two hypergrowth stocks will eventually leave Wall Street's AI darling in the dust.\nThe first high-octane growth stock that can run circles about Nvidia in the return column through 2030 is social media platform Pinterest (NYSE: PINS).\nEven though ad-driven operating models are cyclical, which would expose Pinterest's stock and operating performance to downside during recessions, the economic cycle isn't linear. Whereas recessions are often resolved in less than 12 months, most economic expansions stick around for multiple years, if not a full decade, on rare occasions. Lengthy periods of growth tend to fuel ad spending.\nIn addition to time being squarely on its side, Pinterest's global monthly active user (MAU) count has been steadily climbing over the long run. Pinterest recorded its highest active user count (522 million) during the June-ended quarter. There aren't many social sites with over a half-billion MAUs, which acts as a dangling carrot for businesses looking to advertise. The more MAUs Pinterest has, the likelier it'll possess strong ad-pricing power.\nWhat's arguably even more important than attracting active users has been Pinterest's ability to monetize the users it has. Following a challenging 2023, which was primarily bogged down by economic uncertainty, average revenue per user (ARPU) is strongly climbing, once again. The June-ended quarter saw global ARPU jump 8%, with the strongest growth in ARPU (16% on a year-over-year basis) coming from its most lucrative markets, the U.S. and Canada.\nThis is also a good time to mention that Pinterest has perfectly positioned its operating model to avoid app-developer headwinds, such as the ability to disable data tracking. The entire premise of Pinterest's platform is for its users to willingly and freely share the things, places, and services that interest them. This is invaluable information that can help businesses target Pinterest's users -- and it's another reason companies will pay a premium to advertise with Pinterest.\nThe final piece of the puzzle is Pinterest's pristine balance sheet. It has north of $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, with no debt. This gives it the financial flexibility to weather a recession, as well as deliver shareholder-friendly buybacks.\nThe second hypergrowth stock that looks to be on track to handily outperform AI juggernaut Nvidia through 2030 is cybersecurity up-and-comer SentinelOne (NYSE: S).\nThe beautiful thing about cybersecurity is that it's steadily evolved into a basic necessity service. With businesses shifting their data, and that of their customers, online and into the cloud at an accelerated pace, they're increasingly leaning on third-party providers like SentinelOne to protect this information. Regardless of how well or poorly the global economy is performing, hackers don't take time off. This means demand for cybersecurity solutions is constant in pretty much any economic climate.\nThe company's Singularity platform, which is focused on endpoint, cloud, identity, and data protection services, is what makes the company tick. Singularity relies on AI and machine learning to become more effective at recognizing and responding to potential threats over time.\nOne factor undeniably working in the company's favor is its subscription-driven model. A subscription-focused cybersecurity model tends to keep clients loyal to the brand, as well as generates highly predictable sales and operating cash flow year after year. Annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the company's fiscal second quarter (ended July 31) surged 32%, while adjusted gross margin jumped three percentage points to a delectable 80%.\nSentinelOne is also demonstrating a knack for landing bigger fish. The number of customers generating at least $100,000 in ARR jumped 24% to 1,233 from the prior-year period, while customers producing $1 million in ARR for the company grew at an even faster pace. Larger clients should lead to higher margins and steadier cash-flow generation.\nSimilar to Pinterest, SentinelOne is sitting on a hefty treasure chest. Inclusive of short- and long-term investments, it's sitting on more than $1.1 billion in cash, with no debt. It has more than enough capital to continue innovating, and has the ability to confidently navigate short-lived recessions.\nThe icing on the cake is that SentinelOne is expected to push into recurring profitability during the current fiscal year. Given Wall Street's forecast of 40% annualized earnings growth for the company through fiscal 2029, it has all the hallmarks of a no-brainer buy that can run circles around Nvidia.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Mackenzie Hawkins ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Biden administration officials have discussed capping sales of advanced AI chips from Nvidia Corp. and other American companies on a country-specific basis, people familiar with the matter said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan\u2019s Capital Into Chaos\nDrug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives\nCities Look to AI to Flag Residents\u2019 Trash and Recycling Mistakes\nInside the \u2018Utopias\u2019 of Mexico City\nOne City\u2019s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided\nSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nThe approach would set a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who described the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centers and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said.\nDeliberations are in early stages and remain fluid, the people said, noting that the idea has gained traction in recent weeks. The policy would build on a new framework to ease the licensing process for AI chip shipments to data centers in places like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Commerce Department officials unveiled those regulations last month and said there are more rules coming.\nThe agency\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, which oversees export controls, declined to comment. Nvidia, the market leader for AI chips, also declined to comment, as did Advanced Micro Devices Inc. A representative for Intel Corp., which also makes such processors, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nNvidia shares fell as much as 4.2% in Tuesday trading, after the stock\u2019s record close on Monday.\nA spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the talks but pointed to a recent joint statement by the US and UAE on artificial intelligence. In it, the two countries acknowledged the \u201ctremendous potential of AI for good,\u201d as well as the \u201cchallenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards.\u201d\nSetting country-based caps would tighten restrictions that originally targeted China\u2019s ambitions in artificial intelligence, as Washington considers the security risks of AI development around the world. Already, the Biden administration has restricted AI chip shipments by companies like Nvidia and AMD to more than 40 countries across the Middle East, Africa and Asia over fears their products could be diverted to China.\nAt the same time, some US officials have come to view semiconductor export licenses, particularly for Nvidia chips, as a point of leverage to achieve broader diplomatic goals. That could include asking key companies to reduce ties with China to gain access to US technology \u2014 but the concerns extend beyond Beijing.\n\u201cWe will have to have a conversation with countries around the world about how they plan to use these capabilities,\u201d Tarun Chhabra, senior director of technology at the National Security Council, said at a forum in June without naming specific nations. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about countries that have a really robust internal surveillance apparatus, then we have to think about: How exactly will they use these capabilities to supercharge that kind of surveillance, and what will that look like?\u201d\nThere\u2019s also the question of how global AI development could affect American intelligence operations, said Maher Bitar, another NSC official. \u201cWhat are the risks not just on human rights grounds, but also in terms of the security and the counterintelligence risks to our personnel around the world?\u201d Bitar said at the same event.\nIt\u2019s unclear how leading AI chipmakers would react to additional US restrictions. When the Biden administration first issued sweeping chip regulations for China, Nvidia redesigned its AI offerings to ensure it can keep selling into that market.\nIf the administration moves forward with country-based caps, it may prove difficult to deliver a comprehensive new policy in the final months of President Joe Biden\u2019s term. Such rules could be challenging to enforce and would be a major test of US diplomatic relationships.\nWATCH: Nvidia's Surprising AI Origin Story\nGovernments around the world are in a quest for so-called sovereign AI \u2014 the ability to build and run their own AI systems \u2014 and that pursuit has become a key driver of demand for advanced processors, according to Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang. Nvidia\u2019s chips are the gold standard for data-center operators, making the company the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker and the top beneficiary of the AI boom.\nChina, meanwhile, is working to develop its own advanced semiconductors, though they still trail the best American chips. Still, there\u2019s concern among US officials that if Huawei Technologies Co. or another foreign maker one day offers a viable alternative to Nvidia chips \u2014 presumably with fewer strings attached \u2014 that could weaken the US ability to shape the global AI landscape.\nSome US officials argue that\u2019s only a distant possibility, and that the Washington should adopt a more restrictive approach to global AI chip exports given its current negotiating position. Others warn against making it too difficult for other countries to buy American technology, in the event China gains ground and captures those customers.\nWhile officials have debated the best approach, they\u2019ve slowed high-volume AI chip license approvals to the Middle East and elsewhere. But there are signs things could get moving soon: Under the new rules for shipments to data centers, US officials will vet and preapprove specific customers based on security commitments from both the companies and their national governments, paving the way for easier licensing down the road.\nAll About Nvidia Chips, AI Hype and What Lies Ahead: QuickTake\n--With assistance from Ian King and Jenny Leonard.\n(Updates shares in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAI Detectors Falsely Accuse Students of Cheating\u2014With Big Consequences\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs\nNeuralink Co-Founder\u2019s New Startup Sells a Brain Computer Toolkit\nA Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work\nHow Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock Could Soar Another 561%, According to a Wall Street Analyst",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If you invested $100 in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) at the beginning of 2023, you would now have $830 thanks to the remarkable surge in the company's shares fueled by artificial intelligence (AI). Even so, the stock could jump from about $120 now to around $800 by 2030, according to one analyst.\nPhil Panaro, a former senior advisor at the Boston Consulting Group, believes that the continuing growth of AI and the arrival of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell processors could lead to annual revenue of $600 billion in 2030 from $61 billion in fiscal 2024.\nLet's look at the catalysts mentioned by Panaro and check if they are strong enough to help Nvidia sustain its phenomenal growth in the long run.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on his company's August earnings conference call that accelerated computing is going to be a long-term growth driver. Huang said the transition from general-purpose computing -- using central processing units (CPUs) -- to accelerated computing based on graphics processing units (GPUs) could help reduce computing costs by 90%.\nBecause GPUs speed up demanding workloads in data centers that would have otherwise taken longer using CPUs, Nvidia says, accelerated computing is not only faster, but it is also more sustainable because of its smaller energy footprint.\nHuang projected\u00a0\"$1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing\" based on their energy efficiency.\nData centers are estimated to account for 1% to 2% of global energy consumption, a figure expected to double by the end of the decade. So the much faster pace of GPUs compared to CPUs is expected to help reduce energy consumption long term.\nThe demand for data center accelerators is forecast to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28% through the next five years. And the massive end market that the transition to accelerated computing is likely to create, Huang said, could mean that his company is at the beginning of a phenomenal growth curve.\nThat's because Nvidia is the dominant player in the data center GPU market. It reportedly controlled 98% of this space at the end of last year, so it stands to win big from the secular growth in accelerated computing even if it loses some of that market share.\nThe outlook for Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell AI GPUs seems to be solid, with the company saying demand is tracking ahead of supply, a trend that's likely to continue next year as well.\nNvidia's solid prospects discussed above help explain why the company's revenue estimates have received a nice bump for the next three fiscal years.\nAs shown in the chart above, Nvidia's top line is expected to cross $207 billion in fiscal 2027, more than triple its fiscal 2024 revenue. The company's fiscal 2027 will coincide with the majority of calendar year 2026. So to hit $600 billion in revenue by calendar year 2030 (Nvidia's fiscal 2031), it will need an annual growth rate of 30% over a four-year period.\nNvidia serves multiple fast-growing markets such as AI chips (expected to grow at an annual pace of 41% through 2032), digital twins, and cloud gaming, so there is a good chance that it could indeed hit $600 billion in revenue by the 2030 calendar year. But it remains to be seen if that growth translates into the potential upside that Panaro predicts for the stock.\nAssuming Nvidia does reach $600 billion in sales in 2030, the stock will have to maintain its current price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 32 to generate 561% returns from this level. That would translate into a market cap of $19.2 trillion, compared to the current level of just under $3 trillion.\nIf we don't give Nvidia such a rich sales multiple and assume that it is trading at a P/S of 8 (in line with the U.S. technology sector's average) by 2030, its market cap would jump to $4.8 trillion.\nSo, Nvidia could deliver 61% gains from current levels assuming it trades at a more reasonable valuation. But if the market decides to keep rewarding the company with a rich multiple because of its healthy growth, there is a good chance that it could deliver a much stronger upside in the long run -- and might even get close to Panaro's ambitious estimate.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

NVDA, Palantir Technologies Inc PLTR, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s AMD.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nWall Street celebrated the bull market's second anniversary last week, with the S&P 500 ending at record highs. Since Oct. 12, 2022, the broader S&P 500 has soared more than 60% after hitting a closing low of 3,577.03, per the Dow Jones Market Data.\nThe bull market has hardly shown any sign of slowing down in the past two years, mostly due to a resilient U.S. economy and the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). The AI euphoria, in particular, is expected to drive the S&P 500 higher into the year-end and next year. The extensive adoption of AI is expected to boost real GDP growth, increase earnings per share (EPS), and improve the S&P 500's fair value.\nThe AI boom is here to stay since it is based on practical applications. AI can be utilized to increase product efficiency and curtail costs. Two prominent S&P 500 stocks that made the most of the AI revolution are NVIDIA Corp. and Palantir Technologies Inc.\nNVIDIA is known for providing technologies essential for AI applications. The company's graphic processing unit (GPU) is integral to the computer server infrastructure for training large language models and functioning AI interfaces. Palantir's AI software, on the other hand, is widely used, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has been a huge success.\nShares of NVIDIA and Palantir skyrocketed 1002% and 433.9%, respectively, over the past two years. Shares of these tech players are further expected to scale upward, banking on the AI jubilation and more. Let's have a look \u2013\nThe Biden administration's initiative to cap U.S. chip exports to certain countries is surely a dampener for NVIDIA, but the fierce demand for Blackwell chips would boost its share price.\nCEO Jensen Huang recently said that there is an insane demand for Blackwell chips, which are in full production. The high-end Blackwell B200 chip has more AI throughput than the present Hopper H100 chip, leading to increased demand from companies like Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms, Inc..\nDominance in the GPU market space is another tailwind for the NVIDIA stock. NVIDIA holds more than 80% of the GPU market, which is poised to reach $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion this year, per Precedence Research.\nDevelopers are more inclined toward NVIDIA's more efficient CUDA software platform than Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s ROCm software platform. Hence, the $2.81 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA's earnings per share is up 72.4% from a year ago.\nPalantir is one of the hottest AI players and is largely associated with government contracts. The software company is known for helping the government aggregate its data to save costs and gain efficiency.\nHowever, lately, Palantir has gained interest from commercial customers due to the launch of AIP. In the company's latest quarterly results, commercial revenues in the United States climbed 55% to $159 million, and customer count in the commercial space jumped 83% to almost 300, thanks to the demand for AIP. Notably, Palantir had only 14 U.S. commercial customers four years back.\nPalantir's traditional government revenues also improved 23% in the quarter. Thus, persistent demand for Palantir's AIP, which stands out from the pack, will propel its share prices upward. And with the AI market poised to hit $1 trillion in 10 years, Palantir's shares stand to gain significantly in the long run. As a result, the $0.36 Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLTR's earnings per share is up 33.3% from a year ago.\nOne of the common factors that will drive the share prices of NVIDIA and Palantir is the Federal Reserve's recent move to trim interest rates by 50 basis points in its latest monetary policy meeting. The Fed slashed interest rates after more than two years and penciled in more similar rate cuts soon amid tamed price pressures.\nNow, interest rate cuts bode well for tech players like NVIDIA and Palantir as they curtail the cost of borrowings and jack up profit margins. Similarly, rate cuts don't hinder cash flows, which are essential for both the company's growth initiatives.\nThus, the highest short-term price target offered by brokers for NVDA stock is $200, an upside of 44.9% from the last closing price of $138.07. Analysts' highest short-term price target for PLTR stock is $50, up 15.2% from the last closing price of $43.40.\nNVIDIA stock currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Palantir has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Text": "Think of how Nvidia\u2019s GeForce 8800 chip, launched in 2006, changed the gaming landscape. Now, almost two decades later, Nvidia is still making that progression, with its Blackwell designed to change the world of artificial intelligence.\nDemand is \"insane,\" Nvidia\u2019s chief executive Jensen Huang recently said. Major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud are integrating Blackwell into their infrastructure to support high-performance AI workloads.\nRelated: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just told investors what\u2019s next for the AI chipmaker\nOracle announced on October 2 that it would need 131,072 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs as part of a $6.5 billion investment to establish a new public cloud region in Malaysia, another proof of a strong need for advanced AI processing capabilities.\nBlackwell is a platform Nvidia launched in March that allows organizations to run real-time generative AI on models with trillions of parameters. These large language models are trained on extensive datasets to understand and generate responses in human language.\n\u201cBlackwell is in full production,\u201d Huang said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cThe demand for Blackwell is insane. Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.\u201d\nHyperscaler buyers like Amazon (AMZN) , Microsoft (MSFT) , and Alphabet (GOOGL) are expected to spend around $160 billion in 2024 on AI infrastructure, according to Bernstein analysts. The cost of Blackwell is expected to range between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit.\nHuang emphasized the importance of continuous updates to Nvidia\u2019s AI infrastructure, with the company releasing new platforms annually. \u201cIf we can increase the performance, like we've done for Hopper and Blackwell ... we're effectively increasing the revenue or throughput for our customers on these infrastructures by a couple to three times each year,\" Huang added.\nNvidia\u2019s latest earnings report further solidifies its strong position in the AI market.\nOn August 28, the company posted earnings per share of 68 cents, beating Wall Street expectations of 64 cents. Revenue hit $30.04 billion, up 122%, surpassing the anticipated $28.7 billion.\nNvidia forecasts $32.5 billion in revenue for the current quarter, an 80% increase from last year.\nRelated: Veteran trader targets Nvidia as shares slide\nNvidia plans to ship Blackwell GPUs to clients in Q4 of this year, with a consumer release expected in 2025. \u201cIn the fourth quarter, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue,\u201d Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said during the August earnings call.\nNvidia's stock has surged by over 150% this year, following an impressive 240% gain in 2023. The company is now worth over $3 trillion, one of the most valuable companies in the world just behind Apple and Microsoft.\nJPMorgan remains confident in Nvidia\u2019s outlook, maintaining an overweight rating and a $155 price target, thefly.com reported.\n\"Nvidia remains on track to ship its next-generation Blackwell graphic processing unit platform in high volume production in Q4,\" the analyst tells investors in a research note on October 2, adding that investors do not have to pay too much attention to the recent sell-side noise on rackscale portfolio changes.\nNvidia is halting development of its dual-rack 72-way GB200-based NVL36\u00d72, TF International Securities's analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said on Oct. 1.\nLast month, Bank of America reiterated a buy rating and $165 price target on Nvidia, which the firm also calls its top sector pick.\nThe firm warned of several near-term headwinds, including Blackwell's delay and gross margin pressure, a potential DOJ probe, competition, AI monetization, cloud capex, weak seasonality, and the U.S. elections.\nMore AI Stocks:\nApple stock slides as big iPhone 16 bet sputters\nAnalyst revisits Meta stock price target as Facebook parent ramps AI spend\nAnalyst reviews BlackRock stock rating after AI partnership with Microsoft\nHowever, this could also create a buying opportunity.

        "Text": "Think of how Nvidia\u2019s GeForce 8800 chip, launched in 2006, changed the gaming landscape. Now, almost two decades later, Nvidia is still making that progression, with its Blackwell designed to change the world of artificial intelligence.\nDemand is \"insane,\" Nvidia\u2019s chief executive Jensen Huang recently said. Major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud are integrating Blackwell into their infrastructure to support high-performance AI workloads.\nRelated: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just told investors what\u2019s next for the AI chipmaker\nOracle announced on October 2 that it would need 131,072 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs as part of a $6.5 billion investment to establish a new public cloud region in Malaysia, another proof of a strong need for advanced AI processing capabilities.\nBlackwell is a platform Nvidia launched in March that allows organizations to run real-time generative AI on models with trillions of parameters. These large language models are trained on extensive datasets to understand and generate responses in human language.\n\u201cBlackwell is in full production,\u201d Huang said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cThe demand for Blackwell is insane. Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.\u201d\nHyperscaler buyers like Amazon (AMZN) , Microsoft (MSFT) , and Alphabet (GOOGL) are expected to spend around $160 billion in 2024 on AI infrastructure, according to Bernstein analysts. The cost of Blackwell is expected to range between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit.\nHuang emphasized the importance of continuous updates to Nvidia\u2019s AI infrastructure, with the company releasing new platforms annually. \u201cIf we can increase the performance, like we've done for Hopper and Blackwell ... we're effectively increasing the revenue or throughput for our customers on these infrastructures by a couple to three times each year,\" Huang added.\nNvidia\u2019s latest earnings report further solidifies its strong position in the AI market.\nOn August 28, the company posted earnings per share of 68 cents, beating Wall Street expectations of 64 cents. Revenue hit $30.04 billion, up 122%, surpassing the anticipated $28.7 billion.\nNvidia forecasts $32.5 billion in revenue for the current quarter, an 80% increase from last year.\nRelated: Veteran trader targets Nvidia as shares slide\nNvidia plans to ship Blackwell GPUs to clients in Q4 of this year, with a consumer release expected in 2025. \u201cIn the fourth quarter, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue,\u201d Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said during the August earnings call.\nNvidia's stock has surged by over 150% this year, following an impressive 240% gain in 2023. The company is now worth over $3 trillion, one of the most valuable companies in the world just behind Apple and Microsoft.\nJPMorgan remains confident in Nvidia\u2019s outlook, maintaining an overweight rating and a $155 price target, thefly.com reported.\n\"Nvidia remains on track to ship its next-generation Blackwell graphic processing unit platform in high volume production in Q4,\" the analyst tells investors in a research note on October 2, adding that investors do not have to pay too much attention to the recent sell-side noise on rackscale portfolio changes.\nNvidia is halting development of its dual-rack 72-way GB200-based NVL36\u00d72, TF International Securities's analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said on Oct. 1.\nLast month, Bank of America reiterated a buy rating and $165 price target on Nvidia, which the firm also calls its top sector pick.\nThe firm warned of several near-term headwinds, including Blackwell's delay and gross margin pressure, a potential DOJ probe, competition, AI monetization, cloud capex, weak seasonality, and the U.S. elections.\nMore AI Stocks:\nApple stock slides as big iPhone 16 bet sputters\nAnalyst revisits Meta stock price target as Facebook parent ramps AI spend\nAnalyst reviews BlackRock stock rating after AI partnership with Microsoft\nHowever, this could also create a buying opportunity.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 8 High Growth High Margin Stocks to Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other high growth high market stocks to invest in.\nWhen investor confidence is high, capital tends to flow into growth sectors, driving up stock prices and valuations. This is particularly relevant for companies with strong growth prospects and high margins, as they are often seen as more resilient in a recovering economy. Current market dynamics indicate that much of the upward movement may be attributed to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. High-growth stocks typically trade at higher price-to-earnings ratios, so if the market continues to expand, these stocks could benefit significantly as investors are willing to pay a premium for growth potential.\nJason Trennert, Strategas Research Partners chairman and CEO, joined CNBC\u2019s \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 on October 3 to discuss the latest market trends and the state of the economy, highlighting that the bar is high to get bearish now.\nJason Trennert revealed that he turned bullish at the end of 2023 after initially predicting a recession. Despite the challenges of 2022 and early 2023, which made it difficult to envision a market recovery, he noted that the market has defied expectations and continued to rise. Trennert attributed a significant portion of this upward movement to multiple expansions rather than just earnings growth. He marked a pivotal moment in 2023 as the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, which led to increased liquidity in the market and a subsequent rally. He recalled that around eleven months ago, the S&P 500 briefly hit 4,100 when ten-year yields reached 5%, suggesting that market dynamics have shifted considerably since then.\nWhen discussing current valuations, Trennert pointed out that the market is trading at approximately 22 times earnings during an easing cycle. He expressed skepticism about future earnings growth, as expectations for a 14% increase in S&P earnings next year seem inconsistent with the anticipated six rate cuts from the Fed. He emphasized that if the market is expecting such significant easing while also projecting strong earnings growth, there may be a disconnect.\nTrennert also addressed concerns regarding government spending and deficits, noting that the federal deficit has reached 7% of GDP and expressing a desire for more free-market-oriented policies rather than gridlock in Washington. He criticized both parties for their lack of commitment to reducing deficits and highlighted the moral hazard created by prolonged quantitative easing over the past 12 years. He believes that this situation has led to irresponsible spending practices that will eventually necessitate accountability. Despite these concerns, Trennert acknowledged that it is challenging to adopt a bearish outlook given current market conditions. He noted that ten-year treasury yields above 4.5% typically lead to market indigestion, while yields below this threshold make it hard to remain pessimistic.\nAs for small-cap stocks, Trennert pointed out that they have historically been underrepresented in portfolios and may offer opportunities for future growth. He highlighted that many venture capital-backed firms are looking to go public, with approximately 45% of them potentially tapping into the IPO market at some point. However, he cautioned that if the economy continues to slow down and earnings growth expectations are not met, small caps may struggle.\nSkepticism about the projected earnings growth for the S&P 500 could also apply to high-growth stocks. If expectations for earnings growth are too optimistic relative to economic conditions, such as anticipated rate cuts, it may lead to volatility in high-growth stocks, especially if actual earnings do not meet these elevated expectations. Companies with high-profit margins are generally better positioned to weather economic downturns. As Trennert noted concerns regarding government spending and deficits, firms that maintain or improve their profit margins may be more attractive to investors seeking stability amidst economic uncertainty.\nTrennert\u2019s overall analysis underscores the importance of monitoring government policies and economic indicators as they influence investor sentiment and market performance moving forward. Still, his predominantly bullish sentiment lays the groundwork for a lot of investors, and to make the portfolio expansion process even easier for them, we\u2019re here with a list of the\u00a08 high growth high margin stocks to invest in now.\nMethodology\nWe sifted through Finviz to compile an initial list of the top stocks. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 15 companies with TTM net profit margin above 20% and 5-year net income compound annual growth rates above 25%. We then selected the 8 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 56.73%\nTTM Net Profit Margin: 55.04%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the pioneer of GPU-accelerated computing, specializing in products and platforms for the large, growing markets of gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. Its GPUs have been instrumental in driving advancements in various fields, including deep learning, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality.\nNetApp has launched a new AI tool utilizing NVIDIA technology. Elon Musk\u2019s xAI is leveraging 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for its AI project, Colossal, with potential future expansion to include H200 GPUs and Blackwell chips.\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has formed a strategic partnership with Accenture to accelerate AI innovation. Its AI chip, Blackwell, is now in mass production and experiencing high demand.\u00a0A partnership with Salesforce is established to enhance businesses\u2019 utilization of AI and data. In September, the company introduced Aerial, an AI tool designed to optimize wireless networks for various devices. Its proprietary software, CUDA, provides a competitive edge. The company\u2019s continued success hinges on its ability to sustain innovation and monetize AI effectively.\nThe company\u2019s CEO believes its competitive advantage in AI chips is sustainable. Snowflake, a cloud data warehousing company, that utilizes Nvidia\u2019s AI Enterprise software to integrate NeMo Retriever microservices into its Snowflake Cortex AI, has seen its stock price rise 10% in the past month due to strong prospects driven by a strong portfolio and expanding partner base.\nThe recent earnings beat, upwardly revised guidance, and upward stock movement all point to a potential continued upward trajectory. Investors may want to consider adding NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) to their watchlist or portfolios given its positive momentum.\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cOver the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\u201d\nOverall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of high growth high market stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) is best known for its highly coveted artificial intelligence chips. But at its Nvidia AI Summit in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, the Nvidia vice president of Enterprise Platforms, Bob Pette, delivered an address providing greater insights into the company\u2019s various software platforms.\nNvidia says companies ranging from AT&T (T), Deloitte, and Quantiphi to research centers like the National Cancer Institute and the SETI Institute are using its software technologies to do everything from helping employees work through software development and network engineering jobs to searching for signs of extraterrestrial life.\nNvidia has a number of AI software platforms including Nvidia NIM Agent Blueprints, Nvidia NIM, and Nvidia NeMo. NIM Agent Blueprints is designed to help businesses develop generative AI applications, while NIM provides the ability to quickly put together chatbots and AI assistants. Nvidia NeMo gives companies the means to build their own custom generative AI models.\nShares of Nvidia rose 3.7% following the announcement.\nThe offerings are part of Nvidia\u2019s strategy of ensuring that companies don\u2019t just look to the company for AI processors but also for its software as well, driving additional revenue streams outside of hardware sales.\nAccording to Nvidia, AT&T is teaming with Quantiphi to create a conversational AI platform to assist employees with software development and financial services tasks. The University of Florida is using Nvidia\u2019s NIM and MeMo to improve its learning management system for teaching assistants, and Deloitte is using Nvidia\u2019s NIM Agent Blueprint alongside its own cybersecurity products.\nNvidia says the National Cancer Institute is using NIM Agent Blueprint to help cut down on the time and cost of developing novel drug molecules, while the SETI Institute used the company\u2019s Holoscan software development kit to create software for receiving and analyzing radio waves from space.\nNvidia is also teaming with Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh as part of its new AI Tech Community initiative, establishing two new AI centers at the schools. The company says its Nvidia Joint Center with Carnegie Mellon University for Robotics, Autonomy, and AI will provide students, faculty, and researchers with technologies related to robotics and autonomy, while the Nvidia Joint Center with the University of Pittsburgh for AI and Intelligent Systems will revolve around AI focused on health sciences.\nNvidia has developed the most sought-after AI chips in the world, which has sent its stock price skyrocketing a staggering 934% over the last two years. To put that in perspective, and maybe generate some envy, if you invested $10,000 in Nvidia in 2022, your stake would now be worth $103,400.\nBut the company is facing increasing competition in the hardware space from longtime rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Nvidia\u2019s own customers are also developing their own chips to power their AI software, which could cut into the company\u2019s bottom line in the future.\nNvidia\u2019s endgame is to use software to hold on to its customers well into the future while providing recurring revenue streams.\nHighlighting its software also attracts developers to Nvidia\u2019s offerings, and the more developers that build on Nvidia\u2019s services, the more companies will seek out those platforms.\nNvidia\u2019s hardware lead isn\u2019t going to disappear anytime soon, though. The company has been investing in AI technology for years, and it should continue to hold on to its competitive edge for some time. But by showing off its software, Nvidia is looking to prove it\u2019s more than just a chip firm.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Title": "Bull Market Completes 2 Years on AI Surge; NVIDIA & PLTR Stocks Shine",
        "Author": "  Tirthankar Chakraborty ",
        "Text": "Wall Street celebrated the bull market\u2019s second anniversary last week, with the S&P 500 ending at record highs. Since Oct. 12, 2022, the broader S&P 500 has soared more than 60% after hitting a closing low of 3,577.03, per the Dow Jones Market Data.\nThe bull market has hardly shown any sign of slowing down in the past two years, mostly due to a resilient U.S. economy and the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). The AI euphoria, in particular, is expected to drive the S&P 500 higher into the year-end and next year. The extensive adoption of AI is expected to boost real GDP growth, increase earnings per share (EPS), and improve the S&P 500\u2019s fair value.\nAI boom is here to stay since it is based on practical applications. AI can be utilized to increase product efficiency and curtail costs. Two prominent S&P 500 stocks that made the most of the AI revolution are NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Palantir Technologies Inc PLTR.\nNVIDIA is known for providing technologies essential for AI applications. The company\u2019s graphic processing unit (GPU) is integral to the computer server infrastructure for training large language models and functioning AI interfaces. Palantir\u2019s AI software, on the other hand, is widely used, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has been a huge success.\nShares of NVIDIA and Palantir skyrocketed 1002% and 433.9%, respectively, over the past two years. Shares of these tech players are further expected to scale upward, banking on the AI jubilation and more. Let\u2019s have a look \u2013\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Biden administration\u2019s initiative to cap U.S. chip exports to certain countries is surely a dampener for NVIDIA, but the fierce demand for Blackwell chips would boost its share price.\nCEO Jensen Huang recently said that there is an insane demand for Blackwell chips, which are in full production. The high-end Blackwell B200 chip has more AI throughput than the present Hopper H100 chip, leading to increased demand from companies like Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Meta Platforms, Inc. META.\nDominance in the GPU market space is another tailwind for the NVIDIA stock. NVIDIA holds more than 80% of the GPU market, which is poised to reach $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion this year, per Precedence Research.\nDevelopers are more inclined toward NVIDIA\u2019s more efficient CUDA software platform than Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u2019s AMD ROCm software platform. Hence, the $2.81 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s earnings per share is up 72.4% from a year ago.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPalantir is one of the hottest AI players and is largely associated with government contracts. The software company is known for helping the government aggregate its data to save costs and gain efficiency.\nHowever, lately, Palantir has gained interest from commercial customers due to the launch of AIP. In the company\u2019s latest quarterly results, commercial revenues in the United States climbed 55% to $159 million, and customer count in the commercial space jumped 83% to almost 300, thanks to the demand for AIP. Notably, Palantir had only 14 U.S. commercial customers four years back.\nPalantir\u2019s traditional government revenues also improved 23% in the quarter. Thus, persistent demand for Palantir\u2019s AIP, which stands out from the pack, will propel its share prices upward. And with the AI market poised to hit $1 trillion in 10 years, Palantir\u2019s shares stand to gain significantly in the long run. As a result, the $0.36 Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLTR\u2019s earnings per share is up 33.3% from a year ago.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOne of the common factors that will drive the share prices of NVIDIA and Palantir is the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent move to trim interest rates by 50 basis points in its latest monetary policy meeting. The Fed slashed interest rates after more than two years and penciled in more similar rate cuts soon amid tamed price pressures.\nNow, interest rate cuts bode well for tech players like NVIDIA and Palantir as they curtail the cost of borrowings and jack up profit margins. Similarly, rate cuts don\u2019t hinder cash flows, which are essential for both the company\u2019s growth initiatives.\nThus, the highest short-term price target offered by brokers for NVDA stock is $200, an upside of 44.9% from the last closing price of $138.07. Analysts\u2019 highest short-term price target for PLTR stock is $50, up 15.2% from the last closing price of $43.40.\nNVIDIA stock currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Palantir has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI News You Should Not Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nThe AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification.\nAnother notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, recently made an appearance on a podcast hosted by Rene Haas, the CEO of chip design firm Arm. During his appearance, Huang stressed that the future of AI would be services which could reason. However, he also cautioned that the cost of computing needed to be reduced to reach that phase. Huang further predicted that next-generation AI tools would be able to answer questions by going through hundreds or thousands of steps and reflecting on their own conclusions. Huang added that his company would set the stage for these advancements by strengthening chip performance every year.\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Quality Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other quality stocks.\nThe stock market has seen a notable 20% increase year-to-date, but as it approaches the seasonally volatile months leading up to Election Day, potential volatility is expected. The S&P 500 has historically pulled back 5% to 10% around election time but tends to recover afterward.\nInstead of cashing out, investors are encouraged to take advantage of any market pullbacks. Historically, when the Fed cuts rates without an impending recession, it creates a favorable environment for broader market performance. Mona Mahajan, Edward Jones senior investment strategist, recently appeared on CNBC to discuss her similar sentiment on these latest market trends, and where investors can find opportunities right now. We talked about this in our article about the 10 Best WallStreetBets Stocks To Buy Right Now, here's an excerpt from it:\n\u201cWhen asked if investors should consider cashing out and taking a holiday for the remainder of the year, Mahajan advised against such a move. Instead, she suggested that if there are pullbacks or corrections in the market, it would be prudent to lean into those opportunities... Additionally, rate cuts typically lead to expanded valuations, particularly for sectors that have lagged behind in this regard. She emphasized that lower borrowing costs from Fed rate cuts would benefit both consumers and corporations.\nGlobal Investment Strategist at ProShares Advisors, Simeon Hyman, appeared on CNBC on October 2 to emphasize 'income' as a key focus, highlighting the opportunity in fixed-income markets, which could provide 10-15% returns if geopolitical tensions worsen. He thinks that the US economy is stronger than the rest of the world despite tensions.\nSimeon Hyman emphasized the importance of the term 'income' in the context of current market conditions, noting that the market was just 1% off its all-time highs. This situation presents a salary cut for income-oriented investors, highlighting the challenges they face. However, the fixed-income market offers a silver lining; it currently provides enough yield to cushion against worsening geopolitical tensions. For instance, the yield on the 10-year bond is nearly 4%, and there is potential for it to drop to 3% or lower if significant negative events occur. This scenario presents an opportunity for investors to realize gains of 10% or 15% on bonds in a tumultuous environment, a situation not seen in over a decade.\nDespite the current market being down by 3.7%, which is slightly less than 4%, Hyman insisted that rounding was at play. He expressed surprise at this performance given ongoing geopolitical tensions but pointed out that positive economic news in the US persists. Specifically, there has been a 50-basis point cut and indications of a soft landing for the economy. A month-over-month increase of just 0.1% suggests that if one can overlook geopolitical issues, the US economy is faring better than many others globally and remains on solid economic footing.\nAdditionally, Hyman proposed a covered call strategy focused on the Russell 2000 index, which has been underperforming compared to the S&P 500. He described this strategy as beneficial because it allows investors to generate income that could offset recent losses while maintaining a bullish position in small caps. Historically, rate cuts have positively impacted small-cap stocks, and this strategy enables investors to capitalize on that trend while also generating income through covered calls.\nFor risk-averse investors, the current emphasis on fixed-income markets as a viable investment option aligns well with the insights shared by Simeon Hyman, who highlighted the potential for 10-15% returns in bonds amid geopolitical tensions. Additionally, they may also explore quality stocks with reliable growth histories, which can provide stability in uncertain market conditions, similar to the defensive strategies Hyman suggested. As investors try to track stock performances to find strategies, we're here with a list of the 10 Best Quality Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\nMethodology\nTo compile our list, we first sifted through Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF holdings to find the ones with an upside potential of over 15% as of October 4, 2024. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts' upside potential.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nAverage Upside Potential: 22.10%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is known for its high-performance GPUs, which are widely used in gaming, artificial intelligence, data centers, and professional visualization. Its GPUs are essential for powering advanced graphics and computing tasks, and they are a key component in many modern technologies, such as self-driving cars, virtual reality, and supercomputers.\nThe company recently partnered with Accenture. Management recently talked about this partnership and its new AI chip, Blackwell. Blackwell is now being made in large numbers, and there is a lot of demand for it. AI will help businesses innovate faster through the partnership with Accenture. In late August, management also approved a $50 billion share buyback program.\nNetApp released a new AI tool on September 25 that uses NVIDIA technology to help businesses manage their data. Elon Musk's company, xAI, is using 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for its AI project, Colossal. Colossal may grow to use H200 GPUs and Blackwell chips in the future.\nIts networking platform for AI, Spectrum X, is expected to be worth billions of dollars within a year. The company recently partnered with Salesforce to help businesses use AI and data better. In September, the company also introduced a new AI tool called Aerial to improve wireless networks for mobile devices, robots, self-driving cars, and 5G.\nIts software called CUDA gives it an advantage over competitors. However, the company's future depends on continuing to innovate and find ways to make money from AI. CUDA is a tool that helps developers use GPUs for different kinds of computing. Experts think the company should focus more on robotics to grow.\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) \u2013 Following the release of first-quarter earnings in May featuring record revenue growth of 262% year over year, NVIDIA continued its upward march. On June 10, shares of the company began trading on a split-adjusted basis following a 10-for-1 forward stock split, making stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors alike. Just one week later, the company officially surpassed Microsoft in market cap to become the most valuable publicly traded company (although it would relinquish the title not long after). While other companies have also stood to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) trend this year, NVIDIA stands out as the unquestionable leader in the space and that is unlikely to be challenged for many years ahead. NVIDIA continues to see extremely strong levels of demand and the recent introduction of the Blackwell system looks to be an exciting next phase of growth for the stock.\u201d\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the best quality stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Stocks On the Rise: 8 Best Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best rising stocks to invest In now.\nThe market experts believe that Q3 2024 saw stocks experience increased volatility, witnessing rapid declines and then rebounding. As per the US Bank, a significant Q3 2024 trend is the rotation away from the tech sectors. All the investors continue to ask the same question: Will the rally in mega-cap stocks continue? JP Morgan believes that their outperformance has been noteworthy for quite some time. The investment firm stated that, from a research perspective, the valuations of the biggest stocks appear historically expensive, not just in the US but throughout the developed markets. Therefore, the investment firm\u2019s expected return signals now favour the smaller market cap cohorts.\nThat being said, fundamentals for mega-cap stocks remain outstanding. Such giants have much higher profitability, lower debt, and improved earnings momentum. The bank believes that for investors who are worried about a slowdown, pivoting to mid/small caps remains difficult. On the other hand, investors seeing AI enthusiasm entering the speculative phase will find it easier to liquidate the winners. Therefore, the firm believes that the case for building mid/small cap exposure remains reasonable but not compelling.\nGoldman Sachs increased its year-end target for the S&P 500 and expects more gains for the benchmark in 2025. These gains stem from the stocks, which continue to increase on the back of strong economic growth, lower Federal Reserve interest rates, and expansion of corporate earnings. The US stocks are expected to be aided by numerous tailwinds in the final months of the year, after the Fed\u2019s pivot to rate cuts and the new fiscal stimulus from China. Both these measures improved the risk sentiments. Market experts believe that stocks should see support from the Q3 earnings season and expansion of corporate profits in the final 3 months as the economy continues to surpass expectations.\nLSEG data demonstrates that collective S&P 500 earnings for Q3 2024 should grow 5% as compared to the\u00a0previous year to ~$5.11 billion. This reflects a decline from the earlier projections of a\u00a0$5.19 billion tally. Nonetheless, it still indicates strong momentum for this year and next, with Q4 profits anticipated to increase by ~12.5%.\nRecently, Goldman trimmed its 2024 earnings growth forecast to 8.2% from 8.4%. However, the investment firm expects that earnings momentum will continue to build in the next year. The firm increased its profit growth projection by 5 percentage points to 11%. This upward revision to its 2025 EPS estimate revolves around increased margin expansion. The firm added that the broader macroeconomic backdrop is conducive to slight margin expansion.\nMoreover, the firm increased its year-end S&P 500 target to 6,000 points, exhibiting a rise from the prior forecast of 5,600. The investment firm expects a P/E multiple of ~22x for the S&P 500, which remains in line with the company\u2019s macro model of fair value. This will largely remain unchanged over the upcoming 3 months. For 2025, the bank expects the S&P 500 to increase by another ~300 points, to reach the year-end target of 6,300.\nMarket strategists believe that the momentum in the broader equities is likely to be aided by a\u00a0blowout September 2024 jobs report, the\u00a0start of the US Fed\u2019s rate-cutting cycle, and China\u2019s economic stimulus.\nOur methodology\nTo make a list of 8 Best Stocks to Invest in Now, we used stock screeners to find quality stocks that have gained at least 30% on a YTD basis, as of October 7. We also made sure that these stocks were popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n% Gain on a YTD Basis: ~165%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute and networking solutions in the US, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and internationally.\nNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) has been investing for over a decade in software in such a way that allows its hardware to outperform regular silicon. Such outperformance stems from software optimizations and acceleration libraries which are updated constantly. Moving forward, intangible assets associated with its graphics processing units, and switching costs involved around its proprietary software should continue to act as tailwinds.\nMarket experts opine that, just like iOS, which locks customers into the iPhone since developers are making applications for the iPhone, NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is also working on the same thing. The AI engineers have been learning the CUDA platform to program GPUs. This should assist in locking the people. NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) expects further growth, anticipating Q3 2024 revenue to touch $32.5 billion. The company expects continued expansion in its Hopper architecture and Blackwell products.\nThe company anticipates to ship several billion dollars in revenue from its Blackwell platform in Q4 2024. Also, NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) expects robust growth in the data center business next year. The company sees a strong opportunity in sovereign AI, with countries planning their own generative AI systems. Its strategic focus on Gen AI and enterprise AI should help create additional revenue streams.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. increased its price target from $115.00 to $155.00, giving an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating on 29th\u00a0August. Vltava Fund, an investment management company, recently released its third-quarter 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\n\u201cOver the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\u201d\nOverall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of Best Stocks to Invest in Now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently published an article titled, 11 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar right now.\nIn his recent episode of Mad Money, host Jim Cramer focused on the upcoming market events, emphasizing the importance of new consumer price index data alongside a series of reports as the earnings season kicks off.\nCramer pointed out that the Labor Department\u2019s nonfarm payroll report revealed significant job growth in September, surpassing expectations. He highlighted the significant rally in stocks on Friday, a response to better-than-expected job creation figures. The U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs in September, significantly exceeding Wall Street\u2019s estimate of 150,000. Additionally, there were upward revisions for the previous two months, with 72,000 more jobs reported for July and August combined.\nDespite his initial expectation that stocks would decline as bond yields surged, Cramer noted the resilience in the market. He observed that people seemed to feel relief, thinking that a major economic downturn was not on the horizon, which prompted a flurry of buying activity in the stock market. He added, \u201cMaybe we aren\u2019t headed toward a landing at all.\u201d He described the situation as quite unusual and, in his view, \u201cquite exciting\u201d.\nHe mentioned that on Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee will publish notes from its last month\u2019s meeting, which could clarify the central bank\u2019s bold choice to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. According to Cramer, Wall Street is rife with speculation about the Federal Reserve\u2019s future actions, especially following strong labor statistics released last Friday. As speculation swirls around whether the next cut will be 25 or 50 basis points, Cramer leaned towards the belief that it would likely be 25 or nothing at all. He added:\n\u201cThen again, what really matters is the overall direction for rates, and that direction is most definitely lower, which is bullish for stocks.\u201d\nHe also mentioned that Friday would bring the producer price index report, which, like the consumer price index, will serve as a critical indicator for the Fed\u2019s upcoming decisions. Cramer commented:\n\u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line: a market that appreciates good news, like a robust job creation number, is a market that can handle, well, let\u2019s just say, the historically tough month of October. After today\u2019s performance, all I can say is so far so good.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 4. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nCramer Congratulates NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) On Its GPU\u2019s 25-Year Anniversary\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading global provider of graphics, compute, and networking solutions, known for its technologies that cater to various markets, including gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive applications. Within its Graphics segment, NVIDIA offers GeForce GPUs designed for gaming, the GeForce NOW streaming service, and Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs tailored for enterprise graphics. Additionally, the company develops software solutions.\nCramer commented on the excitement surrounding the company and said:\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang will be ringing the Nasdaq opening bell with his team to celebrate the birth of the GPU 25 years ago. Those are the faster chips that make generative AI work. Congratulations to the NVIDIA team.\u201d\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) first gained recognition with the launch of the GeForce 256 in 1999, which was hailed as the world\u2019s first graphics processing unit (GPU). It revolutionized gaming by delivering smoother graphics and higher frame rates, ultimately shaping the future of computer graphics and gaming experiences.\nOver the years, the company expanded its focus beyond gaming and has made a name for itself, especially in AI. Recently, CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the overwhelming demand for NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation AI chip, Blackwell, calling it \u201cinsane.\u201d\nHuang expressed that the rapid pace of technological advancement presents an opportunity for the company to intensify its innovation efforts. He emphasized the goal of advancing capabilities, increasing throughput, and reducing both costs and energy consumption.\nBlackwell is set to be priced between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit, and demand is high from major corporations such as Microsoft and Meta, which are establishing AI data centers to support applications like ChatGPT and Copilot.\nGeneration Investment Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cRecent net performance is behind market averages. However since the fund\u2019s inception, we have spent only about 8% of the time underperforming on a rolling five-year basis.1 We do not enjoy these spells. A number of different factors has contributed to the current period of underperformance. The fact that we do not own NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one. That single company accounted for roughly 25% of returns in the benchmark so far this year, meaning almost everyone who does not own Nvidia has lost out. Year-to-date, not owning Nvidia explains about a third of our relative underperformance.\nOverall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s radar right now.

        "Text": "Nvidia stock closed at a record high on Monday after surging 18% in nine trading days.\nThe chipmaker's market value soared by $517 billion \u2014 more than Oracle is worth.\nNvidia and CEO Jensen Huang are riding high on massive buzz around its new Blackwell chip.\nFresh buzz around AI lifted Nvidia stock to a record $138 on Monday, extending its rally to 18% over the last nine trading days.\nThe microchip maker's market value has jumped by $517 billion from its October 1 close to hit $3.39 trillion. It's now less than 4% away from overtaking Apple, worth $3.52 trillion, as the world's most valuable public company.\nNvidia has gained more value in nine days of trading than some of the world's largest companies are worth.\nOracle ($488 billion), Mastercard ($468 billion), and Home Depot ($413 billion) are all less than one-sixth as valuable, even though Nvidia only made $61 billion of revenue and less than $30 billion of net income last year.\nThe chipmaker's shares have surged by about 179% this year, and by around 800% since the start of 2023. One of the biggest beneficiaries has been founder and CEO Jensen Huang, whose net worth has ballooned from about $14 billion to $121 billion in under two years.\nHe now ranks as the world's 11th richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, ahead of computing pioneer Michael Dell and fashion mogul Amancio Ortega.\nNvidia's latest rally reflects investors' excitement about its new Blackwell chip, which Huang has hailed as \"the engine to power this new industrial revolution.\"\nIts significance was evident back in March, when a press release announcing its arrival included quotes from Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, OpenAI's Sam Altman, Oracle's Larry Ellison, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Amazon's Andy Jassy, and Alphabet's Sundar Pichai.\nNvidia bosses said in late August they would ramp up Blackwell production in the fourth quarter and sell chips worth billions of dollars before the year ends.\nMore recently, Huang and Nvidia's partners have described immense demand for the processors \u2014 designed to power AI applications at a fraction of the cost and energy consumption of predecessors \u2014 and other chipmakers like Super Micro Computer have reported brisk sales.\nRival chipmaker AMD posted its steepest stock decline in more than a month on Monday after it revealed new AI chips but provided few details on customer demand and financial performance.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Text": "KeyBanc analyst John Vinh shared mixed quarterly supply chain findings for the semiconductor sector. The analyst revised several company estimates and price targets.\nThough most end markets were weak in analog, he noted indications of auto getting closer to a bottom. Traditional server and AI strength is sustained, with Blackwell on track to launch in the fourth quarter without further delays, as per Vinh.\nAlso Read: What\u2019s Going On With Super Micro Computer Stock On Monday?\nThe analyst\u2019s feedback on the iPhone 16 launch appears to be better than feared but could be better. Therefore, Vinh downgraded Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Synaptics Inc (NASDAQ:SYNA) to Sector Weight.\nGiven increased price competition, he expects Qualcomm to lose market share to Mediatek in the mid-to-low-end segment of the smartphone market. This headwind will compound the impacts of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ramping up its internal modem.\nThe Synaptics downgrade reflects its underperformance versus its IoT peers, given limited growth catalysts within its Enterprise & Automotive segment, representing almost 60% of overall revenues and the company\u2019s highest margins. Vinh flagged increased competition in the Chinese market from local chipmaker HiSilicon as another headwind.\nAdditionally, the analyst\u2019s findings were most favorable for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), mixed for Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), and negative for Monolithic Power Systems, Inc (NASDAQ:MPWR), Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MU), Marvell Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL), and Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). He also fine-tuned his estimates on Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM).\nVinh noted that Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell will likely ramp into mass production beginning in December, contributing over $7 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter. He said Hopper demand remains strong, with fourth-quarter revenues increasing ~15% sequentially.\nAMD\u2019s positive catalysts included traditional server demand, the inflection in Genoa instances in the cloud, demand for MI300X remains on track to ship 500K GPUs in 2024, and a possible update on its next-generation GPU and CPU at its AI event on Thursday.\nFor Broadcom, Vinh flagged sustained networking demand from improving traditional server demand, share gains from its 800Gb optical DSP launch, and higher revision of CoWoS demand. Broadcom\u2019s upsides could be offset by Apple preparing its Wi-Fi 7 radio for the iPhone 17 in 2025.\nFor Micron, Vinh flagged oversupply as Micron prompts Samsung to convert its unused HBM capacity back to traditional DRAM to survive the competition.\nMonolithic Power Systems remains vulnerable, given RMAs (Return Merchandise Authorization) for Nvidia H100 AI servers related to field failures associated with Monolithic Power Systems\u2019 power modules increasing again, affecting its market share on Blackwell.\nVinh highlighted his adverse findings from Asia for Marvell Technology. According to the analyst, Marvell is vulnerable to market share loss from the next-generation AWS Trainium 3 loss to Alchip, Google\u2019s second-generation Axion ARM CPU, and Nvidia\u2019s development of its 1.6T optical DSP.\nVinh mentioned his negative findings from Asia for Intel. The analyst highlighted Intel\u2019s server market share loss to AMD and the ramp of Blackwell posing a headwind for Intel. He also flagged the lack of a cost-down AI CPU targeted at mass market AI PCs is likely to result in a share loss for Intel and disappointing feedback on Intel\u2019s AI chip Gaudi 3.\nPhoto via Shutterstock\nAlso Read:\nNext-Gen Nvidia GPUs Could Be Revealed at CES 2025 \u2013 What You Need to Know\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nFeb 2022\nMizuho\nMaintains\nBuy\nFeb 2022\nMorgan Stanley\nMaintains\nOverweight\nFeb 2022\nJP Morgan\nMaintains\nOverweight\nView More Analyst Ratings for QCOM\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.\nUS technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk.\nWhile tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nThis has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave \u2014 particularly in software and cloud services.\nTheir scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants.\nLet's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. William Blair analysts Sebastien Naji and Jason Ader recently released an investor note on the AI landscape, placing the chipmaker among the top picks for large cap generative artificial intelligence companies. The note detailed that the company had already seen tremendous growth for its GPU and parallel computing systems, and there was time for continued growth, driven by robust training demand from hyperscalers and enterprises, and a ramping inference opportunity. Per the analysts, Nvidia had also created a sustainable moat as its CUDA software stack was the standard interface for working with GPUs and AI, and there was room for growth in both training and inference as the new Blackwell cycle began.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang expects billions of dollars in revenue from Blackwell sales in the coming months. Blackwell is expected to cost between $30,000-$40,000 per unit and is in demand from major companies like Microsoft and Meta, as well as other firms building AI data centers to power products like ChatGPT and Copilot. Huang recently called Blackwell demand insane during an appearance on CNBC.\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Shares of Nvidia closed at their highest ever on Monday, putting the heavyweight AI chipmaker on the brink of dethroning Apple as the world's most valuable company.\nWith investors betting on strong demand for its current and next-generation AI processors, the Santa Clara, California company's stock climbed 2.4% to end the day at $138.07.\nIn June, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company. It was overtaken by Microsoft, and the tech trio's market capitalizations have been neck-and-neck for several months.\nThe latest gains lifted Nvidia's market value to $3.39 trillion, just below Apple's $3.52 trillion value and above Microsoft's $3.12 trillion.\nNvidia has been Wall Street's biggest winner from a race between Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and other major tech companies to dominate emerging AI technology.\n\"We believe the major companies in AI ... face an investment environment characterized by a Prisoner's Dilemma \u2014 each is individually incentivized to continue spending, as the costs of not doing so are (potentially) devastating,\" TD Cowen analysts wrote in a report on Sunday.\nTD Cowen reiterated its $165 price target for Nvidia, which it called its \"Top Pick\", and it said demand for the company's current generation of AI chips remained strong.\nNvidia in August confirmed reports that a ramp-up in production of its upcoming Blackwell chips was delayed until the fourth quarter, but downplayed the impact, saying customers were snapping up existing chips.\nAs investors gear up for quarterly reporting season, Apple rose almost 2% and Microsoft added 0.7%, helping propel the S&P 500 up 0.8% to its own record high close.\nNvidia, Apple and Microsoft account for about a fifth of the S&P 500's weight, giving them a hefty influence in the index's day-to-day gains and losses.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the contract manufacturer that produces Nvidia's processors, is expected to report a 40% leap in quarterly profit on Thursday, thanks to soaring demand.\nAnalysts expect spending to build out AI data centers will help Nvidia's annual revenue more than double to nearly $126 billion, according to LSEG data.\nWhile Nvidia's rally has lifted the S&P 500 to record highs, investors worry optimism about AI could evaporate if signs emerge of a slowdown in spending on the technology.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by David Gregorio)\n"

This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher.

Thus, Wall Street expects their combined capital bill to top $60 billion in the quarter ended September, up 56% year over year, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. Another sizable double-digit jump is expected for the December quarter, which would bring the year\u2019s total outlay to about $231 billion, some 49% higher than 2023.\nExpectations for next year aren\u2019t exactly down to earth either. \u201cIn 2025, Cloud Capex spend will equate to the entire Apollo Space program in real terms,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts predicted in a report earlier this month.\nThis particular moonshot is great news for Nvidia. The company\u2019s data-center revenue is projected to surge 97% year over year to $28.6 billion for its fiscal quarter ending later this month. But a major return on that investment for Nvidia\u2019s largest customers still seems in a galaxy far, far away. Only Microsoft has made limited disclosures about how generative AI services have contributed to revenue growth. But even those may not mean much this time around given changes to its financial reporting that were announced in August and take effect in the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter report on Oct. 30.\n\u201cInvestors\u2019 models are not likely to be consistent, but that may be the plan in a difficult period when opaque results may be beneficial to Microsoft,\u201d wrote John DiFucci of Guggenheim in a report last week. He added that he believes demand for the company\u2019s M365 Copilot, which uses generative AI to help users do things like analyze spreadsheets and create PowerPoint presentations, has been \u201clackluster.\u201d\nThe other companies have their own issues going on. A growing number of analysts think Amazon\u2019s spending on an ambitious satellite program could bring the company\u2019s operating income below Wall Street\u2019s stated targets for this year and next, thus curbing the operating margin expansion the company has been delivering of late.\nGoogle and Meta are believed to be enjoying a strong online advertising market, but Google is now under the cloud of the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to break up the company, while Meta could be more exposed to a slowdown in ad spending by Chinese e-commerce companies like Temu and Shein. Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird also believes investors aren\u2019t fully accounting for how blowout capital spending will raise depreciation charges against future earnings; he expects Alphabet, Amazon and Meta\u2019s operating income for the fourth quarter to come in 1% to 4% below Wall Street\u2019s consensus forecasts.\nApple, meanwhile, is grappling with what looks like a disappointing launch of its first AI smartphone, with several analysts estimating weak initial demand for the iPhone 16 family that went on sale last month. And while Apple isn\u2019t engaged in the same capital expenditure race as the others due to its hardware-centric business model, it too sees generative AI as a massive opportunity and is spending accordingly. Apple\u2019s research and development expenses are expected to hit a new record of $31.5 billion for the fiscal year ended September, up nearly 6% from the previous year despite an estimated revenue gain of less than 2% in that time, according to FactSet estimates.\nWall Street is still largely positive on the potential for AI to boost big tech\u2019s fortunes; Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta average buy ratings from 91% of analysts covering those stocks, according to FactSet. And a survey of more than 400 companies by Morgan Stanley found about 40% of the respondents who have adopted generative AI solutions say the returns on their investments are exceeding expectations.\n\u201cNonetheless, few GenAI adoption projects have yet moved from proof of concept to production,\u201d the Morgan Stanley report read.\nIt remains to be seen if Big Tech\u2019s AI investments will be a gold mine or money pit.\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com\nUnitedHealth Delivered a Beat\u2014Here\u2019s Why the Stock Plunged Anyway\nInvestors Spend a Lot of Time Thinking About Risk.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has started off October with a bang. After suffering through an epic meltdown over the summer, things are beginning to look up. A lofty valuation and concerns about the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption gave investors pause, sending the AI chip specialist skidding as much as 27%. However, Nvidia regained its footing early last month and has rallied more than 29% in the roughly four weeks since.\nThe stock added to its tally today, climbing as much as 4.5%. By the time the market closed, the stock was still up 4.1%.\nAfter a rally of that magnitude, investors are wondering if the stock is still a buy.\nNvidia stock has been on a blistering rally since the start of last year, with the stock gaining more than 800%. The advent of AI caused a mad dash for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs), which have the raw number-crunching capability needed to process AI. This insatiable demand showed in Nvidia's results, as the company generated five successive quarters of triple-digit, year-over-year sales and profit growth. However, when the company forecasted revenue growth of \"just\" 80%, fair-weather investors thought the sky was falling and headed for the hills. That may have been a costly blunder.\nIn an interview last week, CEO Jensen Huang said the demand for Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell AI architecture is \"insane.\" He went on to say, \"Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.\" This comes in stark contrast to recent fears that demand for AI had peaked.\nWall Street continues to bet on Nvidia in a big way. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse is representative of the mood among analysts, noting Nvidia has \"the best upside consensus\" among all the stocks he covers, saying it's \"far and away our Top Pick.\"\nOne of the biggest sticking points for investors was Nvidia's lofty valuation, and at 62 times earnings, that concern is understandable. However, for Nvidia's 2026 fiscal year (which begins in January), Wall Street is predicting earnings per share of $4.02. At its current share price of about $133, that works out to about 33 times forward earnings, which is only a slight premium to the multiple of 30 for the S&P 500.\nThat's an attractive price to pay for a company with so many ways to win.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Probably Missed.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks.\nInvestors have been looking for smart ways to play the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has swept the global financial markets over the past two years. Most of the attention in this regard has been confined to obvious choices in semiconductors, software, and biotechnology. Even within these sectors, prominent companies and their AI initiatives have dominated headlines. However, there are several hidden gems within these sectors that offer the same bang for the buck, given present macro context, but are not in limelight as such. For example, Bernie Ahkong, an analyst at UBS, recently noted that the first phase of AI was interest towards chipmakers. In the second phase, investors moved towards the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centers. The present tilt towards utility and power firms is quite possibly the third phase of this AI focus.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nA recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Susquehanna analyst Chris Rolland recently released an investor note on the chipmaker, detailing that pricing on the Hopper line of products for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) had remained strong ahead of the upcoming Blackwell line. Per the analyst, aftermarket prices for the H100 had been relatively stable at slightly less than $30,000. down 0.6% in the third-quarter. He further added that there had not been any rise in H100 supply in the secondary market, suggesting that companies were holding on to their purchases. At current pricing and 70% utilization, there was a relatively short five-month hardware payback period for cloud service providers renting the H100, which would justify the continued spending, Rolland added.\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "How long will the strong artificial intelligence buildout last? The market appears optimistic, with AI chip leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) trading at 34 times forward earnings estimates and challenger Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) trading at 30 times.\nHowever, there is a considerable debate among investors as to whether this hypergrowth is sustainable, or whether the AI buildout is going to pop like the dot-com bust.\nThis week, CEOs of AI chip leaders Nvidia and AMD made announcements, each of which gave even greater weight to the bull case for their stocks and AI chips stocks generally.\nAI stocks pulled back hard over the summer after a strong 18 months or so of performance, as skepticism worked its way into the story. After the Magnificent Seven, who are the main buyers of AI chips, reported good but not blowout earnings in July, investors appeared concerned that these big chip buyers weren't seeing a requisite return on their investments in Nvidia chips. Most big tech stocks and AI chip plays sank in response.\nGiant hedge fund Elliott Management piled onto the skepticism, giving especially bearish commentary on what it perceives as an AI \"bubble.\" Elliott wrote in its latest letter to investors that AI stocks were overhyped, declaring AI applications aren't, \"ever going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.\" Elliott dismissed the technology as only good for a few things such as summarizing reports and helping with computer coding.\nThat's certainly a point of view that should be considered. It may even be true of the current models that are out today. However, virtually everyone participating in the technology industry believes in the benefits. If benefits weren't likely going to be there, it seems unlikely every major technology company would be greatly expanding its AI investments today as they are.\nFor his part, Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison dismissed these concerns, declaring the race for AI supremacy \"goes on forever, to build a better and better neural network.\" Ellison believes that AI capabilities will improve with more compute and better models, and that the large tech companies can't afford to cede the AI lead to competitors. With big tech armed with a ton of cash, he doesn't see the buildout ending for five to 10 years.\nThis week then saw two massive announcements from the number one and two AI chip companies that should allay near-term fears about the durability of the AI trade. At the beginning of the month, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang said demand for its next generation chip Blackwell was \"insane.\" Fast forward to last week, and analysts at Morgan Stanley revealed Blackwell is already sold out for the next 12 months, after the firm hosted Nvidia executives at their offices.\nThen on Thursday, AMD held its \"Advancing AI\" event during which it unveiled its new EPYC 9005 CPUs and Instinct MI325X GPUs. During the presentation, CEO Lisa Su increased her projection for the market size for AI accelerators. Last year, Su surprised investors by forecasting the AI accelerator market would increase from $45 billion in 2023 to a whopping $400 billion in 2027.\nSo, has the past year made her more skeptical or anxious about all that spend, as Elliott surmises?\nJust the opposite, in fact. During the conference, Su raised her guidance for the AI accelerator market to reach a whopping $500 billion by 2028, saying, \"Since [last year], AI demand has continued to take off and exceed expectations. It's clear that the rate of investment is continuing to grow everywhere, driven by more powerful models, new use cases, and actually just a wider adoption of AI use cases.\"\nIf Su's and Huang's projections hold, more companies will benefit than just Nvidia and AMD. Any company with a strong competitive position in the related foundry, semicap equipment, server, or AI-integrated software industries should also see a benefit from this medium-term demand. Additionally, electricity and transmission providers should also see strong growth, as AI data centers consume a huge amount of energy.\nWhile the dot-com bubble burst in the year 2000, remember that there was a five-year \"boom\" that preceded it. The boom coincided with the period after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates between 1995 through 1998. Looking at today's situation, the AI boom is only about two years old, and the Fed similarly just began a rate-cutting cycle in September.\nTo this investor, it appears we may be more in the \"mid-90s\" analogy rather than the precipice of an enormous bubble bursting. There's also a case for the boom to go on for a longer time than the internet boom did, as the companies investing AI, the Mag Seven, are all extremely strong financially -- much stronger than a lot of the newer start-up tech companies of the mid-1990s. In addition, for all their success, the Mag Seven really don't trade at the crazy valuations seen by big tech in the late 1990s.\nThat doesn't mean the AI buildout couldn't become a bubble -- it could. But it still seems early, and AI stocks are too reasonably priced for a huge fall, barring any outside exogenous shocks.\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. \nNvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains.\nThe stock\u2019s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips.\nNvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by an abundance of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs \u201cremains extremely robust.\u201d A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia\u2019s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday.\nNvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan\u2019s largest supercomputer during Foxconn\u2019s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it\u2019s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia\u2019s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions.\nNvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday after market close, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year.\nNvidia\u2019s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company\u2019s second quarter earnings.\nShares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China due to rising trade tensions with the US had also driven shares down. Nvidia\u2019s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June.\nOther recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations \u2014 another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term.\n\u201cAI is hot,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, \u201cI see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.\u201d\nThe chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech\u2019s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown.\nSemiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia\u2019s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet \u201ccrazy\u201d demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs.

        "Title": "Nvidia Bet Millions on This AI Stock. It's Up 165%.",
        "Author": "  Ryan Vanzo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Earlier this year, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) revealed that it invested capital in several promising artificial intelligence (AI) companies. Management clearly believed the investments would pay off, but it also positioned the company as a direct enabler of its end markets.\nAfter all, Nvidia isn't an AI company itself. Rather, it supplies the AI industry with critical components like graphics processing units, or GPUs. By investing in the overall growth of AI, Nvidia can not only book a potential investment profit, but also spur long-term demand for its own products.\nNo matter how excited Nvidia management was about its capital allocation decisions, few likely predicted what would happen with one of the investments. Following Nvidia's $3.7 million investment in February, SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) saw its valuation soar by 165%. And there could be even more upside to go.\nWithin weeks after Nvidia disclosed its investment in SoundHound, the two companies revealed a partnership that will see their respective products packaged together, including an in-vehicle voice assistant that \"uses a large language model (LLM) completely on the edge while running on the Nvidia Drive platform,\" SoundHound announced in May.\nIn a nutshell, vehicles that run Nvidia's Drive platform will be able to tap into SoundHound's voice recognition platform to provide the driver and passengers with AI capabilities even without an internet connection. The use cases are exciting. You can pull up a song playlist from your favorite streaming provider, ask about the news or current events, or even chat with your car about its maintenance history and potential repair needs in the future. With SoundHound, you car essentially becomes an AI agent, able to converse and consider almost anything you throw at it -- with everything running locally, no connection needed.\nSoundHound has acquired a reputation for services like this. All, unsurprisingly, deal with the intersection of AI and sound.\nSeveral fast-food restaurants are testing its products for drive-thru windows -- a clever way to potentially increase order efficiencies and reduce operating costs. Tech companies have integrated its software into their applications, allowing users to better interact with their services through natural voice commands. And a host of other businesses -- from Block to Oracle -- are already using SoundHound to operate their customer service lines.\nThere's no doubt that Nvidia's investment spurred a spike in SoundHound's valuation. It's a strong vote of confidence, and a promising sign that SoundHound will continue to be able to source the critical components necessary to operate and improve its technology. Wall Street analysts expect the company to grow sales by roughly 84% over the next year, from $83 million to more than $150 million.\nThere's a lot to like about SoundHound. It operates in the AI space -- arguably the biggest growth opportunity in a generation -- and has the backing of major industry suppliers like Nvidia, who put their money where their mouth is. But should you join Nvidia and buy SoundHound shares for your portfolio?\nAccording to data from Grand View Research, the voice AI market is projected to grow by nearly 30% annually from 2024 to 2030. Thus far, SoundHound has actually been able to outpace those growth estimates. But now trading at 23 times sales, these high growth rates have arguably already been priced into the stock. That's especially true considering the company will face mounting competitive pressures from global tech giants, nearly all of which are investing billions into their own voice AI platforms.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nNvidia (NVDA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 67.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 117.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -23.1%.\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 2.2%.\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.5% over the past month.\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nvidia a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "On Oct. 7, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) launched its much-anticipated artificial intelligence (AI) Summit in Washington, D.C. The three-day event was intended to showcase the real-world applications of the technology that has help send its stock up by 2,700% in just five years. \nBut talk is cheap. And the market is probably waiting for more concrete data before unlocking Nvidia's next bull run. Let's dig deeper. \nFollowing the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, there has been no shortage of grandiose projections for the future of generative AI -- a market some analysts at Bloomberg believe could be worth $1.3 trillion in just a decade (up from $40 billion in 2023). Against this backdrop, Nvidia will have difficulty impressing the markets with its own projections. But that isn't stopping the chipmaker from trying to reignite optimism.\nWith the AI market still overwhelmingly geared toward hardware and infrastructure, Nvidia is keen on convincing people that the software it powers can create real-world value.\nAt its investor day, management expanded on several interesting projects, including its NIMs (Nvidia interface microservices) blueprints, designed as a simple way for developers and companies to deploy generative AI in specific use cases like customer service agents or drug discovery. However, the most exciting development could be what Nvidia calls \"physical AI,\" which will involve semiautonomous robots interacting in the real world.\nAccording to CEO Jensen Huang, electronics supplier Foxconn, whose parent company is Hon Hai Precision, is already partnering with Nvidia to build and train AI-capable robots. That said, investors may want to wait for more details before getting excited. Because even if a company makes an intelligent robot, there is no guarantee it will generate profits or value for shareholders.\nWith shares up by around 5% since Oct. 7, Nvidia's AI summit reignited some optimism about the future of its chip business. But short-term fluctuations mean little in the grand scheme of things. Zooming out, Nvidia's stock still trades below its all-time high of $136 per share reached on June 18, despite solid operational performance.\nSecond-quarter revenue jumped 122% year over year to $30 billion, driven by growing demand for data center graphics processing units (GPUs) like the h100 and h200. However, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 35, Nvidia's valuation is relatively cheap relative to growth, implying the market doubts its ability to maintain current momentum. For context, the Nasdaq-100 has an average forward estimate of 30.\nBut while the average Nasdaq giant built up its business over decades of serving established, profitable sectors of the economy. Nvidia's AI business exploded in just a few years. And promises of a future dominated by AI-robot fleets can't shake the fear that this hype-fueled industry might disappear as quickly as it came. According to research from Rand Corporation, around 80% of AI projects fail, which is twice the failure rate from non-AI-technology-related start-ups.\nWhile the future of AI tech remains uncertain, Nvidia's business looks likely to maintain its elevated growth rate for the foreseeable future. Large tech companies don't want to be seen as falling behind in a new technology platform, so they are willing to spend billions on Nvidia's hardware, even if they might not get a direct return on investment. \nMeta Platforms is a great example of this type of demand. On the surface, the social media giant doesn't seem to have a good way to monetize generative AI because its flagship large language model (LLM), Llama, is free and open source for developers. Nevertheless, CEO Mark Zuckerberg expects infrastructure spending to increase in 2025 as the company works to train new versions of Llama to keep up with rival platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini.\nIt is unclear how much longer the AI arms race will last without profitability gains to justify it, so investors might want to hold off on Nvidia stock until more information becomes available. \nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Commenting about the Fed\u2019s rate cut, Fisher recently advised investors not to focus on what the central bank is doing and instead pay attention to long-term investing.\n\u201cThe fact is, and I\u2019ve said this for a long time, I won\u2019t live forever, but I hope to live a long time and keep saying it: central bankers are crazy. Throughout my life, central banks have operated on flawed ideas and groupthink, which is an inefficient way to manage markets.\u201d\nFisher gave an example of how you could end up losing money following the herd mentality when it comes to central bank moves.\n\u201cIf you had followed the common belief that when the Fed and other central banks hike rates, you should get out of stocks, that would have worked for a couple of months in 2022. By the middle of the summer of 2022, during the height of rate hikes, you would have been on the wrong side of the market. From June 2022 onward, as the Fed hiked rates by 75 basis points nearly every month, the market was just a few months away from rising, leading to the bull market we\u2019re in now, in 2024.\nFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher\u2019s hedge fund\u2019s Q2 holdings and picked its top AI investments. We have analyzed the AI-related growth catalysts for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nBillionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s Stake: $11,543,247,605\nNvidia\u2019s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\nAt Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\nOf course, Nvidia won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIf Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA\u2019s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been on an epic roller-coaster ride in recent months. After taking a beating over the summer and losing more than a quarter of its value, the stock has mounted an impressive recovery and now sits roughly 10% off its all-time high (as of this writing).\nComments made by CEO Jensen Huang helped fuel its rise today, as the stock gained 3.1% as of 2 p.m. ET.\nDespite the volatility, investors should keep their eyes on the prize.\nNvidia has become something of a battleground stock in recent months and both sides have valid points. Management's most recent forecast calls for sales growth of 80% for the current quarter. While that's a deceleration of the triple-digit growth that captured headlines over the past year, it's still impressive nonetheless.\nBears also point to the company's gross margin of 75.1% in its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), noting a decline from 78.4% in Q1. Given that it was a record performance, it's best viewed in that context.\nManagement noted gross margin was down sequentially due to product mix and inventory provisions for its next-generation Blackwell AI processors, which are scheduled to begin shipping in Q4. Historically, new products have carried a higher margin profile, which could send gross profits higher. Furthermore, in an interview yesterday, CEO Jensen Huang noted that demand for the Blackwell processors was \"insane.\"\nFinally, bears point to Nvidia's lofty valuation, and at 58 times earnings, it's easy to see their point. However, analysts' consensus estimates are calling for Nvidia to generate earnings per share of $4.02 in its fiscal 2026 (which begins in January). That works out to less than 30 times next year's expected earnings, which is comparable to a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30 for the S&P 500.\nWe're still in the early innings of generative AI adoption. Some experts estimate the market will be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. As a company at the forefront of the AI revolution, Nvidia still has plenty of upside ahead.

        "Title": "Should You Follow These Billionaires and Dump Nvidia Stock? 3 Questions to Consider",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Semiconductor specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has emerged as the face of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Over the last two years, the company has gained trillions in market cap and now sits behind just Apple and Microsoft as the world's third-most valuable company.\nAnd yet, despite its meteoric rise to the top, some of the world's largest hedge funds have been selling Nvidia stock as of late. Two notable examples include Ken Griffin's Citadel reducing its stake in Nvidia by 79% last quarter and D. E. Shaw trimming its position by about half.\nDoesn't it seem odd that big-name investors are selling Nvidia stock on the backdrop of AI being the next big frontier?\nTo be honest, maybe not. Below, I'll explore three areas that could be convincing billionaires to trim their positions in Nvidia while looking for growth elsewhere.\nOne of the most integral components of generative AI development is advanced chipsets called graphics processing units (GPUs). While Nvidia is currently the biggest fish in the GPU pond, there is another side to this growth story. Namely, many other companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and even Tesla, are developing their own AI infrastructures.\nMany of these companies are already building their own custom chips. This could be an issue because each big tech giant outlined above has long been rumored to be a major Nvidia customer.\nI'll concede that using their own chips will not be the end for Nvidia. These companies will likely remain customers and complement their chips with Nvidia's infrastructure.\nWith that said, I think Nvidia will gradually lose its commanding pricing power as the GPU market becomes more saturated. Although it will take years, Nvidia will likely begin to witness a decline in revenue growth. As its top line starts to decelerate, I think it's natural that Nvidia's gross margins will tighten, which can significantly reduce the company's overall earnings power.\nFor these reasons, I think more sophisticated investors are beginning to realize that Nvidia's ability to consistently generate record revenue and profits is shrinking.\nAt the moment, Nvidia is well ahead of peers, such as Advanced Micro Devices or Intel, in the GPU realm. Perhaps the strongest pillar supporting Nvidia's fortress is the tight integration between the company's hardware and software.\nNvidia's compute unified device architecture (CUDA) software layers on top of the company's GPUs. It is incredibly difficult for developers to use a combination of chips from other companies with Nvidia's CUDA. As a result, companies are opting to train their AI protocols entirely on Nvidia's end-to-end product suite.\nThis dynamic has helped Nvidia gain an estimated 88% share of the GPU market. What's even more staggering is that the company's next-generation Blackwell GPUs, set to release later this year, could easily help Nvidia gain even further momentum and market share dominance.\nWhile this has played a big role in Nvidia's current trajectory, the momentum could come to a halt. Why? Well, given Nvidia's pseudo-monopoly, it's entirely plausible that the Department of Justice (DOJ) could investigate Nvidia's business practices. In turn, Nvidia could be forced to loosen its ecosystem, which would have implications for the company's growth.\nThe chart below illustrates Nvidia's stock price over the last two years. With more competition on the horizon and the possibility of government intervention, it's hard to buy into a narrative in which Nvidia stock rises by another 900% over the next two years. I do not think the company has enough catalysts to run at a commensurate pace over the next several years.\nThere are a lot of unknowns surrounding Nvidia and its future prospects.\nWill new chips from other \"Magnificent Seven\" members be a detriment to Nvidia? Will the DOJ accuse Nvidia of self-dealing and force the company to open up its products to be more congruent with competitor's chips?\nWhat I can say with some confidence is that the probability of Nvidia stock becoming another multibagger anytime soon is slim.\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding Nvidia, its competitive landscape, and the pulse of the AI market in general, I think selling some stock and taking profits while also keeping some allocation in the company is a prudent strategy.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 8 Most Profitable Tech Stocks Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other most profitable tech stocks right now.\nIn an interview with CNBC on October 10, Drew Pettit, Director of US Equity Strategy at Citi Research, shared his thoughts about the upcoming earnings season and its potential impact on the market. With the Dow and S&P 500 reaching new closing highs, Pettit raised the question of whether earnings would justify the current valuations. The technology sector has been on a tear, with many software names running up significantly in recent weeks. However, Pettit\u2019s warning suggests that investors should be cautious about getting too caught up in the hype. He noted that when there\u2019s a high bar, investors should be prepared for potential disappointments.\nPettit sounded a note of caution when it came to the tech sector, particularly software stocks. He noted that software has the highest bar within tech, not just in terms of growth expectations but also in terms of monetization. Many software companies are not seeing the expected growth in the next three years, which is already priced into their valuations. This mismatch between expectations and reality could create volatility in the sector.\nIn terms of specific guidance, Pettit expects companies to use the current uncertainty as an excuse to walk down expectations for Q4. This is a typical trend in US markets, where companies tend to set low expectations and then beat them. Pettit advises investors to focus on companies that can deliver on their promises.\nOverall, Pettit\u2019s comments suggest that investors should be cautious about the tech sector, particularly software stocks, and focus on companies that can deliver on their promises. He also emphasizes the importance of looking beyond the current quarter and focusing on long-term growth prospects.\nDan Flax, Senior Research Analyst at Neuberger Berman is bullish on the technology sector, with a focus on companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on the next generation of workloads and are executing well on their product cycles. Flax expects concerns about cyclical headwinds to remain a factor but also sees select opportunities in the sector. He also noted that enterprise customers are looking to adjust to changes in the landscape cyclically and invest in transforming their organizations, which will drive technology spending in the second half of the decade.\nAs investors navigate the current market landscape, it is essential to approach the tech sector with a sense of caution. While the sector has been experiencing a significant upswing, investors should focus on companies that have a proven track record of delivering on their promises, rather than getting caught up in the hype surrounding certain stocks.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the 8 most profitable tech stocks right now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 40 largest technology companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 5-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 5-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Then we sorted the stocks in ascending order, according to their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from our database of 912 elite hedge funds, as of Q2 of 2024.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0\u00a0\nTTM Net Income: $53.00 Billion\u00a0\u00a0\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 80.81%\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) and has been at the forefront of AI, gaming, and data center technology. The company\u2019s GPUs are widely used in gaming, deep learning, and high-performance computing. NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI and machine learning solutions have also been adopted across various industries such as healthcare, automotive, and finance. NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) customers include Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Tesla.\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is poised for continued growth and success, driven by its strong position in the data center market and its upcoming Blackwell chip. Blackwell is high in demand from companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and other firms building AI data centers to power products. Blackwell is expected to cost between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit. The Blackwell GPUs are already being released to data centers and industrial customers for artificial intelligence applications and will be available for consumers in 2025.\nIn an interview with CNBC, CEO Jensen Huang said that \u201cBlackwell is in full production and demand for Blackwell is insane\u201d and that \u201cEverybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first\u201d. NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) leadership in the field of accelerated computing and generative AI is also a major driver of its growth prospects. Management has emphasized the importance of these two computing transitions, which are expected to drive long-term sustainability in capital expenditure spending.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has growing opportunities in the enterprise AI wave, automotive, and healthcare segments are expected to drive further growth, as the company\u2019s products and solutions become increasingly adopted in these industries.\nIn Q2, global spending on cloud infrastructure grew 19% year over year to $78.2 billion, according to Canalys. Hyperscalers are expected to spend about $160 billion in 2024 on AI infrastructure. Analysts forecast the company\u2019s earnings will increase by 81.88% this year and have a consensus Buy rating at a target price of $148.23, which implies a 9.48% increase from its current levels. With its strong position in the data center market and its growing opportunities in new industries, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and drive further growth.\nOverall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of most profitable tech stocks right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang recently made a big statement about the future of AI in the United States. Speaking at a Bipartisan Policy Center event, Huang told U.S. government groups, like the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DOD), that they need to get serious about artificial intelligence. His main point? The U.S. shouldn't just be making rules about AI \u2013 it should be leading the way in making and using it.

He believes that the DOE and DOD should not just be setting policies for AI, but actively participating in its advancement. \u201cDon\u2019t just be a governor of AI, be a practitioner of AI,\u201d he stressed.\nAccording to Huang, a powerful AI supercomputer would revolutionize science and engineering by enabling the creation of novel algorithms that would increase American competitiveness abroad.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Elise Gould from the Economic Policy Institute discussed the latest employment data as she highlighted the continued strength of the U.S. labor market.\nPayroll employment increased by 254,000 in September, with revisions adding 72,000 jobs from previous months. The unemployment rate remained stable at 4.1% and showed declines among various demographics, especially among men.\nGould emphasized that the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is at a 23-year high, which shows a strong economy. Despite wage growth reaching 4%, she downplayed concerns that this could lead to inflation and mentioned improvements in productivity and a low labor share of corporate income.\nShe expressed confidence in the labor market's strength and suggested that it may influence the Fed's decisions on interest rates. She also believes that the Fed should normalize rates, which remain high historically given current employment levels.\nGould observed that the overall labor market is strong, but not excessively heated, as shown by softer job turnover rates.\nAt CNBC\u2019s Closing Bell, Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel discussed the impact of the recent economic data on the stock market. He noted that while 550,000 jobs were added in the third quarter, wages remained flat, leading to a GDP growth projected at 2.5% to 3%.\nSiegel believes that the Federal Reserve will likely implement smaller rate cuts of 25 basis points rather than larger cuts and will aim for a long-term neutral rate of about 3.5% by the second half of next year.\nHe expressed optimism regarding the stock market and suggested that the S&P 500 could reach 6,000 by year-end. However, he mentioned that higher yields may present challenges.\nDespite concerns about equity valuations appearing high, Siegel pointed out that with cash still abundant and a resilient economy, the market remains attractive. He acknowledged that while the forward earnings ratio for the market is around 21.5x, it is not expensive in the current economic climate. He emphasized the absence of recession indicators and the potential for earnings growth and suggested that while significant market gains may not be expected, there is still room for growth.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we looked at the October 2 holdings of iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF and narrowed our list to 8 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The best momentum stocks to invest in are listed in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment which was taken from Insider Monkey's database of over 900 elite hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading company in the technology sector, well known for its work in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence. Originally focused on enhancing the gaming experience, the company revolutionized computer graphics with the release of its GPU in 1999, which significantly improved both video game performance and 3D applications.\nOver the years, the company diversified its offerings to include central processing units (CPUs), data processing units (DPUs), and various software solutions for high-performance computing and deep learning. The company now operates in industries ranging from gaming and professional visualization to data centers, automotive, and healthcare. The company tops our list of best momentum stocks.\nA major upcoming product from NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the Blackwell line, expected to drive considerable revenue and bring innovations to the industry. With improvements in supply chain conditions, orders for Blackwell products are increasing. CEO Jensen Huang has confirmed that the company is ramping up Blackwell GPU production and aims to begin shipments by the fourth quarter. While some engineering issues may delay certain releases, the company remains on course to scale up production as it moves forward into the next year.\nThe company is expected to benefit from significant growth driven by the AI-driven data center expansion. At the GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at around $250 billion, potentially reaching between $1 trillion and $2 trillion over the next decade.\nWhile the company will face competition from companies such as AMD and AI accelerators developed by Google, Amazon, and Apple, analysts expect NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) data center market share between 2025 and 2029 to exceed $950 billion. Despite the competition, the company is expected to be the dominant force in the market.\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) also recently introduced its new series of multimodal large language models, NVLM 1.0, which performs at the highest level on both vision-language and text tasks.\nAccording to the company, it competes with top proprietary models like GPT-4o and open-access ones such as Llama 3-V 405B and also improves on text-only tasks after multimodal training. The model weights and training code are being made open-source through Megatron-Core.\nThe model excels in various multimodal tasks, such as following instructions, recognizing humor, reasoning, and solving math problems step-by-step. It uses a hybrid architecture that improves training efficiency and accuracy, along with a unique 1-D tile-tagging design for high-resolution image tasks.\nThe company\u2019s LLM stands as a new major competitor in the industry that META and Alphabet dominated.\nGeneration Investment Management stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cRecent net performance is behind market averages. However since the fund\u2019s inception, we have spent only about 8% of the time underperforming on a rolling five-year basis.1 We do not enjoy these spells. A number of different factors has contributed to the current period of underperformance. The fact that we do not own NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one. That single company accounted for roughly 25% of returns in the benchmark so far this year, meaning almost everyone who does not own Nvidia has lost out. Year-to-date, not owning Nvidia explains about a third of our relative underperformance.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best momentum stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Maham Fatima ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 8 Most Active US Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the most active US stocks to buy now.\nAmid economic uncertainty and upcoming elections, analysts are adopting a cautious stance due to market volatility driven by mixed investor sentiments. It\u2019s being noted that while the Fed\u2019s easing cycle could yield positive market outcomes in the coming months, immediate stock performance remains uncertain as many investors prefer to wait until after the elections to commit capital.\nVance Howard, CEO of Howard Capital Management, is of a similar view, as he is predicting a significant rate cut in early 2025 due to declining inflation. He emphasized that markets typically rise following initial rate cuts and advised investors to remain optimistic despite current market fluctuations. Howard recommended focusing on resilient sectors like utilities, real estate, and technology, while also considering financials as likely beneficiaries of future rate cuts as we approach 2025. We actually covered his opinion in more detail in our\u00a08 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Invest In Now\u00a0article, here\u2019s an excerpt from it:\n\u201cHoward pointed out that historically, after the first rate cut, markets tend to rise, with a perfect record of being higher 7 out of 7 times following such cuts. He also noted that if the S&P 500 has already gained 10% in the first half of the year, there is an 83% chance of continued upward movement in the second half. Therefore, he advised investors to remain optimistic and not be overly distracted by current market noise.\u201d\nLiz Young Thomas, SoFi head of investment strategy, joined \u2018Squawk Box\u2019 at CNBC on September 30 and shared her insights regarding the market\u2019s trajectory as it approaches an easing cycle. She acknowledged that while there has been a significant run-up leading to this cycle, much of the substantial gains may have already been realized.\nHowever, she noted that this does not necessarily mean the market will slow down immediately. Historically, after the first rate cut, markets tend to remain flat or slightly up in the following 30 to 60 days. 3 months post-cut, the market evaluates whether these cuts were necessary due to cooling economic conditions or if they were merely opportunistic adjustments.\nYoung highlighted several positive factors contributing to the current market rally. Despite a slight pullback in technology stocks, she observed that many other stocks are performing well, with 80% of the S&P 500 trading above their 200-day moving averages. This indicates a strong internal market dynamic. Additionally, optimism surrounding potential stimulus measures from China adds further support to market sentiment.\nWhen discussing valuation concerns, Young agreed that while US market multiples are relatively high, hovering around 21 to 22, this is not unprecedented when compared to historical standards. She pointed out that current valuations are above both the 5-year and 10-year averages but not at overbought levels. Young referenced Warren Buffett\u2019s long-term investment philosophy, emphasizing that he does not focus on timing market multiples but rather on fundamental growth.\nYoung expressed a desire for the market to shift towards trading based on fundamentals rather than multiple expansions. She noted that while earnings stability is crucial, there are signs of strength in sectors outside of technology, particularly in industrial stocks. However, financials have shown mixed signals.\nAs for identifying sectors with potential for faster earnings growth, Young emphasized the importance of thorough research and analysis rather than relying solely on top-down market movements. She identified healthcare, especially biotech and pharmaceuticals, as a promising area for growth. Healthcare tends to perform well in environments characterized by a steepening yield curve, which has been observed recently.\nMoreover, she cautioned against assuming certainty in market outcomes. With prevailing confidence in a soft landing scenario from both the market and the Fed, she advised investors to remain vigilant and consider protective strategies. She suggested exploring opportunities across the Treasury curve, particularly in shorter-duration bonds, as a hedge against potential faster-than-expected rate cuts by the Fed.\nYoung\u2019s insights propose that by focusing on sectors with strong fundamentals and remaining adaptable to changing conditions, investors can position themselves for potential gains while being mindful of risks associated with high valuations and economic uncertainties. With that said, we\u2019re here with a list of the\u00a08 most active US stocks to buy now.\nMethodology\nWe sifted through Yahoo Finance\u2019s list of the most active US stocks that are experiencing high trading volumes. We looked at the top 15 US stocks to find the ones that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We then narrowed down our list to the 10 stocks with high trading volumes and those that were the most popular among hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their trading volumes, as of September 30.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nVolume: 271.009 million\nAverage Volume (3-Month): 326.28 million\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading technology company known for its high-performance GPUs, making it a major player in the gaming, artificial intelligence, and data center markets. Its GPUs are widely used for demanding applications such as gaming, machine learning, and scientific computing.\nChinese regulators are discouraging businesses from purchasing NVIDIA chips, according to Bloomberg reports. While the US government restricts the sale of advanced chips to Chinese entities, some models, like the H20, are permitted for export. NVIDIA generates approximately 12% of its revenue from low-end chips and software sold to Chinese companies.\nThe company still experienced significant growth in FQ2 2025, with revenue surging 122.40% compared to the previous year. The data center segment drove this growth, with revenue increasing 54% due to strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers accounted for approximately 45% of data center revenue. Partnerships with healthcare institutions and rising demand for AI-powered diagnostic solutions contributed to this impressive financial performance.\nOn September 25, NetApp unveiled its new AI-powered data solution, leveraging NVIDIA technology, which enhances NetApp\u2019s unified storage operating system, benefiting thousands of enterprises that rely on NetApp for their data infrastructure.\nElon Musk\u2019s AI startup, xAI, has launched Colossal, the world\u2019s most powerful AI training system. Powered by 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, Colossal is expected to expand further with the integration of H200 GPUs and potentially Blackwell chips. While the company faces challenges in product launches and GPU pricing, its focus on AI monetization and sustainability initiatives positions it for long-term success.\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) \u2013 Following the release of first-quarter earnings in May featuring record revenue growth of 262% year over year, NVIDIA continued its upward march. On June 10, shares of the company began trading on a split-adjusted basis following a 10-for-1 forward stock split, making stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors alike. Just one week later, the company officially surpassed Microsoft in market cap to become the most valuable publicly traded company (although it would relinquish the title not long after). While other companies have also stood to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) trend this year, NVIDIA stands out as the unquestionable leader in the space and that is unlikely to be challenged for many years ahead. NVIDIA continues to see extremely strong levels of demand and the recent introduction of the Blackwell system looks to be an exciting next phase of growth for the stock.\u201d\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of most active US stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Investing.com -- Goldman Sachs raised its price target for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $150 from $135 per share in a note Friday, reflecting an 11% potential upside.\nThe investment bank said that in a recent investor meeting with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress, and IR representative Stewart Stecker, its analysts came away with a stronger conviction about Nvidia's competitive position, particularly in relation to the increasing complexity of inference workloads.\n\"We came away from the NDR with a better appreciation of the company's competitive moat and, importantly, the projected increase in Inference workload complexity as well as its implications for future compute demand,\" Goldman Sachs stated.\nThe bank also said Nvidia's competitive moat rests on various factors such as the company's large installed base, its ability to innovate not just at the chip level but at the data center level, and its robust and growing software offerings, including domain-specific libraries such as Nvidia Parabricks (i.e. genomics analysis) and Nvidia AI Aerial (i.e. software-defined and cloud-native 5G networks).\nThe firm also increased its FY2026/27 revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates by 7% and 8%, respectively, as they factored in higher cloud capex, robust order trends for AI servers, and improvements in the CoWoS outlook at TSMC.\n\"Our updated FY2026 non-GAAP EPS (excl. SBC) of $4.63 sitting 14% above FactSet Street consensus,\" said the analysts, who maintain a Buy rating on Nvidia and keep it on their Americas Conviction List.\nGoldman Sachs views Nvidia as well-positioned to capture ongoing demand in AI and cloud computing sectors, reinforcing its bullish stance on the stock.\nRelated Articles\nNvidia: Goldman Sachs lifts target, sees 11% potential upside\nEndesa shares rise as RBC says 'guidance extremely conservative'\nIn France's Cognac, Beijing and Brussels' EV spat spells disaster\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October.\u00a0Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nVenu Krishna, Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that he is not revising his S&P 500 year-end projection of 5,600 because he believes stock valuations are \u201cfull.\u201d\n\u201cIf you see what\u2019s happening, numbers (earnings)\u00a0 have been cut sharply going into the end. What is still anchoring the market is big tech, even though their earnings themselves are kind of decelerating. Then seasonality comes into play. October is the weakest month, and you don\u2019t want to get ahead of that.\u201d\nAsked whether he does not believe the market really broadened out, Krishna said while there were some signs of market broadening, the \u201canchor\u201d of the rally remains big tech, which according to him, are just six stocks.\nMoving beyond the earnings and valuations debate, another factor still impacting investor sentiment is the Federal Reserve\u2019s next moves.\nTalking about the latest Fed minutes released October 9, \u00a0Wolfe Research\u2019s Stephanie Roth said on CNBC that a \u201csubstantial\u201d majority of Fed officials wanted a 50-basis-point rate cut. However, she said in the next meeting, a 50bps rate cut is \u201coff the table.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news. With each stock we mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives has yet again reiterated that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will be among the top beneficiaries of the huge AI spending.\n\u201cThe supply chain is seeing unparalleled demand for AI chips led by the Godfather of AI Jensen and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and ultimately leading to this tidal wave of enterprise spending as AI use cases explode across the enterprise,\u201d analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients. \u201cWe believe the overall AI infrastructure market opportunity could grow 10x from today through 2027 as this next generation AI foundation gets built, with our estimates [showing] a $1 trillion of AI cap-ex spending is on the horizon [over] the next 3 years.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\nAt Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\nOf course, Nvidia won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\nGeneration Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cRecent net performance is behind market averages. However since the fund\u2019s inception, we have spent only about 8% of the time underperforming on a rolling five-year basis.1 We do not enjoy these spells. A number of different factors has contributed to the current period of underperformance. The fact that we do not own\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is one. That single company accounted for roughly 25% of returns in the benchmark so far this year, meaning almost everyone who does not own Nvidia has lost out. Year-to-date, not owning Nvidia explains about a third of our relative underperformance.\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other profitable NASDAQ stocks.\nRecent analysis indicates that an anticipated tech rally may be delayed until year-end, despite the S&P 500 achieving a remarkable 20% increase year-to-date. As September closed, the index rose by 1.6%, defying its historical volatility and showcasing market resilience. Positive macroeconomic indicators are emerging, with upward revisions to Q3 growth estimates and low jobless claims, suggesting a stable economic foundation.\nHowever, concerns about sustaining market momentum without new catalysts persist. Historically, stock prices and price-to-earnings multiples rise together unless disrupted by negative events. As the market approaches traditionally strong months following elections, expectations for a potential year-end rally are building. Despite elevated volatility and geopolitical tensions, investor caution remains. The NASDAQ 100 has surged significantly over the past two years, but this performance does not yet indicate speculative excess. In the last days of September, DataTrek Research co-founder, Nick Colas, joined CNBC to discuss the trading day and highlighted his outlook on the NASDAQ during the conversation. We covered his views in our article on the 10 Best Performing NASDAQ Stocks in 2024. Here's an excerpt from it:\n\u201c...Over the past two years, the NASDAQ 100 has surged approximately 67%, marking a significant recovery since its lows in October two years ago. This performance is substantially above the historical average return of around 25%. Colas emphasized that while such returns are impressive, they do not yet indicate speculative excess; historically, a doubling of the NASDAQ over two years would signal potential trouble for investors.\nIn a recent discussion on October 9,\u00a0 Jason Snipe, Odyssey Capital Advisors principal, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss the tech sector's mega-cap momentum, particularly in light of recent mega-cap stock downgrades and significant investor outflows. Despite these challenges, Jason Snipe noted that the tech sector is having a positive day, attributing this to a combination of improved earnings estimates across various sectors and substantial investments in AI-related capital expenditures. He emphasized that ~40% of operating cash flow is being allocated to AI, raising questions about when these investments will start to yield returns. This focus on AI has contributed to some recent downgrades but also suggests continued upside potential for select names within the sector.\nSnipe further defended the tech space by highlighting the profit margins of mega-cap stocks, which average over 23%, compared to just over 8.5% for other sectors. This discrepancy indicates a strong reason for ongoing capital inflows into tech and software companies that demonstrate earnings strength. He acknowledged that while there may be some consolidation and a slowdown in growth, he believes that investors' muscle memory will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.\nWhen discussing NVIDIA's recent performance, Snipe pointed to comments made by the CEO regarding the endless demand for their Blackwell chip as a significant catalyst for the stock's movement. He expressed confidence that it would exceed earnings expectations when they report later in the earnings season. However, Snipe also addressed concerns regarding Amazon, which has seen its stock decline for 8 of the last 9 days. He noted that its retail business appears to be struggling, with retail making up 62% of its operations. Despite this, he highlighted AWS as a bright spot, which reported a 19% year-over-year acceleration. He suggested that competition from other retailers could pressure its retail margins but remained optimistic about the company's diverse revenue streams, including advertising and subscription services.\nSnipe's analysis underscores the complexities facing the tech sector amid market volatility and evolving economic conditions. While challenges persist, particularly with mega-cap stocks experiencing downgrades, there are also significant opportunities driven by innovation and strong profit margins that could support continued growth in this space. As expert sentiments shift regarding MAG7 and other big tech stocks, other profitable tech companies are maintaining their positive momentum in the market.\nMethodology\nWe sifted through Finviz to compile an initial list of the top NASDAQ stocks. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 20 companies with positive TTM net income and 5-year net income compound annual growth rates. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nTTM Net Income: $53 billion\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 80.81%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0\u00a0\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are applied in gaming, artificial intelligence, data centers, and professional visualization. It's known for its innovative technology and its role in driving advancements in fields like machine learning and deep learning.\nImpax Asset Management, a $50 billion asset manager, has increased its stake in NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) after underestimating the company's potential. The firm believes the company is currently undervalued, considering the growing demand for its chips driven by the AI boom. Impax also sees the focus on energy efficiency as a positive factor from a climate perspective.\nThe company achieved significant growth in FQ2 2025, with revenue surging 122.40% from a year-ago period. The data center segment was the primary driver of this growth, with revenue increasing 54% due to strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers accounted for a significant portion of data center revenue, contributing to the company's impressive financial performance. Partnerships with healthcare institutions and increasing demand for AI-powered diagnostic solutions also played a role.\nIts technology is used by various companies, including NetApp, which recently unveiled a new AI-powered data solution in late September. Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, is also utilizing NVIDIA's H100 GPUs for its Colossal AI training system. Its focus on AI monetization and sustainability initiatives positions the company for long-term success. While the stock may seem expensive, its valuation is reasonable considering its growth prospects.\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cOver the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\u201d\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the most profitable NASDAQ stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "In case you had forgotten that the stock market still belonged to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), its CEO, Jensen Huang, reminded investors in a CNBC interview last week.\nDemand for Nvidia's new Blackwell chip is \"insane,\" he said, adding, \"It [Blackwell] gives us an opportunity to triple down, to really drive the innovation cycle so that we can increase capabilities, increase our throughput, decrease our costs, decrease our energy consumption.\"\nWhile the Blackwell platform is highly anticipated by both Nvidia's customers and the investor community, the AI chip pioneer's stock has been stuck in neutral for the past few months after it peaked in June.\nHuang's latest comments helped spark a gain in Nvidia stock, but these three catalysts could power the stock even higher in the fourth quarter.\nLately, Nvidia has been largely immune from the vicissitudes of the macro-level economy. The company has reported five straight quarters of triple-digit percentage revenue growth as it tries to fill seemingly insatiable demand for its AI components.\nWhile it's unlikely that either the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts or the strong September jobs report will directly impact Nvidia's business, they should influence investor perception of the stock and valuation models related to it, as well as the capital expenditures of its key customers.\nIn other words, lower interest rates should help loosen the purse strings of companies investing in AI, and increasing confidence in the strength of the economy will also quell doubts about the AI boom, as the two trends can reinforce each other in a virtuous cycle. Additionally, lower interest rates tend to lead to higher valuations for growth stocks like Nvidia due to the nature of the discounted cash flow model. That alone could add buoyancy to the stock price.\nExcitement for generative AI and its potential applications continues to build as the technology advances and companies deploy new products like Meta Platforms' new generative AI photo editor. The latest round of funding for OpenAI, which included an investment from Nvidia and valued the start-up at $157 billion, also shows that expectations for generative AI continue to grow.\nBuilding on that momentum, there are a number of AI events scheduled in Q4 that could drive Nvidia stock higher. For instance, the AI summit Nvidia is hosting from Monday through Wednesday of this week will include presentations and live demos on topics like generative AI, remote sensing, robotics, industrial digitization, and beyond. The company isn't expected to release new products at the conference, but favorable responses from industry insiders could drive the stock higher, as could other surprise announcements.\nThe most anticipated AI-related event of the quarter is probably Tesla's robotaxi event, which is scheduled for Thursday. It's unclear what Tesla will unveil, but CEO Elon Musk has been talking up the idea that robotaxis will be transformative for his company for years now, so expectations are high.\nImportantly, Tesla's self-driving systems rely on Nvidia's AI hardware, and Musk has sung the company's praises on several occasions. Autonomous vehicles could be the next major frontier for Nvidia and AI, and Huang said in an interview in May that Tesla was \"far ahead in self-driving cars.\"\nIt will likely take a lot to impress Nvidia investors at this point, but Blackwell has yet to factor into the company's financial results. JPMorgan recently reaffirmed its expectations that Nvidia will generate several billion in sales from Blackwell in Q4, as it's still planning high-volume production of chips using the new platform this quarter. Morgan Stanley predicts more than $10 billion in Q4 revenue from Blackwell.\nWith the company's Q3 earnings report due out in November, investors should be mindful of the Osborne effect -- the tendency of customers who know that better new tech is just around the corner to cancel their planned purchases of the soon-to-be prior-generation option. In short, it's possible some buyers may be delaying some AI chip purchases until the Blackwell lineup arrives.\nHowever, the new platform has the power to sustain Nvidia's soaring growth rate and advance generative AI applications, which would help assuage concerns about an AI bubble as companies are spending on AI infrastructure. However, there has yet to be a transformative and profitable use case for generative AI.\nRight now, one thing is clear with Blackwell, however. There's no shortage of demand. As Huang told CNBC earlier, \"Blackwell is as planned. Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first.\"\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Text": "It's no secret that Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks have dominated the market for the last few years. With firms like PwC -- one of the \"big four\" accounting firms -- making claims that AI could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 -- the hype makes sense.\nThe revolution's poster child, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), saw its stock skyrocket nearly 1000% from late 2022 to today, but the last few months have not been as kind. After reaching its highest peak in June, shares of Nvidia are down about 10%. More significant market fears mixed with slower growth have caused some to cool on the once red-hot stock. So, where to go from here?\nAs the de facto leader of the entire industry, Nvidia needs to continue to do just that: lead. The 2024 AI Summit, which begins October 7, is a chance for the company to bring together some of the biggest faces and best minds in the industry to help push AI forward, all while keeping itself front and center. It's a chance to communicate Nvidia's vision not just to other industry leaders, but to the public at large.\nOne of the primary questions investors have for the company -- and it's a very legitimate one -- is: Are the real-world applications of AI that impactful? Is the incredible cost of AI hardware worth the investment? The summit will be a chance for Nvidia to showcase the myriad ways AI can be used to return real value. It's a chance to justify the enormous cost of its chips and, ultimately, the price of its shares.\nThe event in and of itself is unlikely to move the needle, but it may help ease some fears and get investors thinking about the possibilities and power of AI. Luckily, the event isn't happening in a vacuum. Here are a few reasons why Nvidia is in a prime position to capitalize on the event.\nIn Nvidia's only major snafu since the AI boom took off, the company announced its latest line of chips, dubbed Blackwell, was delayed. Issues in its manufacturing meant they wouldn't be shipped on time. Nvidia assured that shipments would only be delayed a quarter. Despite these reassurances, some investors worried the issues were more fundamental and the delay would be longer.\nIt seems those fears were unfounded. According to a recent report by \u200b\u200bTom's Hardware, the company is ready to ship the first batch as early as December, only about six weeks behind the original schedule, although these reports have yet to be confirmed by Nvidia. If true, it would do a lot to ease investors' fears and show that the company went above and beyond in fixing its mistake.\nStill, even if they don't ship until later in the quarter, the rollout will be huge for the company regardless. Their impact will be felt immediately, with billions in sales expected before the end of its Q4.\nIt's easy to get bogged down in numbers and fixate on balance sheets and income statements, and while these are extremely important when evaluating a business, certain intangibles are often what makes a company great, like vision. Nvidia has it in spades. Under the leadership of CEO Jensen Huang, the company has been at the forefront of several macro movements in tech. Huang saw back in the early 90s that computer graphics would be huge. The company's GPUs -- graphics processing units -- are a big part of what enabled the video game industry to evolve to where it is today.\nThis vision is why the company controls roughly 90% of today's AI chip market. Nvidia saw that its GPUs could do much more than push the bounds of computer graphics; they could power a new technological revolution. It's why the company caught its competition sleeping. Since the current AI boom took off in late 2022, Nvidia's chips have consistently been miles ahead. Other chipmakers have been playing catch-up ever since.\nThere was relative parity between Nvidia and its longtime rival AMD for decades. Not so anymore; last year, Nvidia made more in profit than AMD made in total revenue. The difference right now is stark, but remember, if Nvidia is profiting much more than its rival, it can then afford to spend more on research and marketing to widen its moat and fend off competitors.\nI know I just said not to get bogged down in the numbers, but they are still important. How is the market valuing Nvidia right now? At a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 56, Nvidia isn't cheap, but given its current pace of growth, a trailing P/E isn't really the best metric for us. Its forward P/E -- that is, a P/E that accounts for its expected earnings in the next 12 months rather than the last 12 -- is just above 30. That's not bad in the world of tech. It's just about where Apple and Amazon sit.\nAnother useful valuation is the PEG ratio, which you get by dividing a company's P/E by its expected earnings growth. This is an excellent metric for companies with a lot of growth potential. As a very general rule, a PEG under 1 is what we're looking for. Nvidia's is 0.94.\nNvidia has plenty of room to deliver the kind of growth that can justify its current valuation. To be sure, metrics are not the be-all and end-all. They are imperfect instruments, and of course, metrics that rely on expected earnings are especially imperfect -- the future is anything but guaranteed. I believe Nvidia will continue to outperform the market for some time.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nAs technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden. The latest funding would go towards helping universities, national laboratories, and the private sector develop AI-powered autonomous experimentation for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which are used to develop advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company consistently grew its quarterly revenue by triple-digit percentages over the past year, propelling its market capitalization to $3.2 trillion.\nNow, it's spreading some of its wealth by investing in smaller companies in the AI industry. It bought shares in a handful of companies at the end of 2023, including top performers Arm Holdings and SoundHound AI.\nAccording to a July 18 regulatory filing, Nvidia also converted a promissory note to acquire 1 million shares of Serve Robotics (NASDAQ: SERV), which develops autonomous last-mile delivery solutions. It invested a total of $12 million into Serve since 2022, and currently owns 3.7 million shares, which represents around 8% of the company.\nServe stock soared 225% when investors learned of Nvidia's latest move, but since plummeted 31% from that peak. It's a tiny company with a market cap of just $400 million, and it could deliver plenty of upside if it executes on its business mode. So, should investors follow Nvidia's lead and buy the stock?\nIn an August presentation to investors, Serve Robotics posed a thoughtful question: Why do we use two-ton cars to deliver two-pound burritos? It goes on to highlight the hazards posed by cars, to both pedestrians and the environment.\nServe believes robots and drones are the answer instead, because the falling cost of AI hardware and software, combined with higher wages and labor shortages, will result in attractive economics for autonomous delivery solutions. In fact, the company believes the market for robotic and drone delivery could top $450 billion by 2030.\nServe designed robots with Level 4 autonomy, which means they can drive on the sidewalk using AI with no human intervention. The company deployed 100 of them in Los Angeles under a pilot program in 2022, and completed over 50,000 deliveries for 300 different restaurants. The company says the robots had a failure rate of 0.5 per 1,000 orders, which translates to a success rate in excess of 99.9%, making them 10 times more reliable than human drivers.\nServe is now working on deploying 2,000 robots by the end of 2025 on Uber's meal-delivery platform, Uber Eats. It will expand within Los Angeles and enter new markets including Dallas and San Diego. The new robots will be manufactured exclusively by Magna International, an $11.8 billion components supplier to the automotive industry.\nUnder the terms of their deal, Magna is also paying Serve a licensing fee to use some of its software to create other autonomous robots outside of the food delivery industry, providing the start-up with another revenue stream.\nServe generated just $207,545 in total revenue during 2023, but that was nearly double what it generated in 2022.\nIts growth is going to accelerate substantially in 2024 because it has already generated over $1.415 million in revenue during the first two quarters. That included $1.15 million from the Magna licensing deal and $265,086 from its food delivery business.\nHowever, the company said its software services deal with Magna was largely completed during the second quarter, meaning it doesn't expect any further revenue from the partnership in the upcoming third quarter. That could result in a significant drop in Serve's total revenue in the second half of 2024, and into 2025.\nEven though the company is growing its core revenue from actual deliveries, it's not enough to offset its alarming cash burn. The company lost $18.1 million in the first six months of 2024, after spending an enormous amount, including $12.4 million on research and development alone. That means Serve is on track to exceed its 2023 loss of $20.7 million, potentially by a very wide margin.\nServe ended the second quarter of 2024 with $28.7 million in cash on hand. Most of that came from its $40 million equity raise in April, when the company was elevated to a listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange from the over-the-counter\u00a0market (which is where many high-risk small-cap stocks trade). However, its second-quarter cash balance doesn't include a further $20 million the company raised in August.\nConsidering Serve's $18.1 million loss in the first half of 2024, a cash balance of $48 million probably won't last even two years unless the company dramatically cuts costs. On the plus side, Uber and Nvidia are two of Serve's largest shareholders, so it's possible they will step in to fund the start-up while it continues to scale up.\nThe stock's valuation is another reason investors should be cautious. The company is likely to generate around $1.7 million in total revenue this year -- based on the $1.15 million it received from Magna, plus more than $530,000 in delivery revenue if we extrapolate its first-half result. Therefore, based on its current market capitalization of $400 million, its stock trades at a daunting forward price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 226.\nThat makes Serve much more expensive than Nvidia, which trades at a forward P/S of 25.9 as of this writing. Considering Nvidia is on track to deliver $125.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025 (ending Jan. 31, 2025) and is highly profitable, it makes no sense for Serve stock to trade at such a lofty premium.\nNvidia's stake is definitely a positive sign for the start-up. But remember, the chipmaker is a $3.2 trillion giant, so it can afford to lose the $12 million it has poured into Serve so far. At the current valuation, I don't think you should be participating.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

AI startups in general have been quicker at making revenues than previous technology booms, according to an analysis of payment information by fintech firm Stripe. The report underlines that top AI groups are reaching millions of dollars in sales within a year. This timeline is far faster in the life cycle of a startup than comparable non-AI tech groups. The report relies on annual revenue data for the 100 highest-grossing privately held AI companies using Stripe, compared with a comparable basket of prominent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) start-ups as of July 2018.\nThe report has gained a lot of traction since Stripe customers include OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, GitHub and Midjourney, among others. Stripe claims, per Financial Times, that AI start-ups took a median 11 months to hit $1 million in annual revenue after their first sales on Stripe, compared with 15 months for the previous generation of SaaS companies.

        "Text": "Nvidia\u00a0has been the poster child for the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution thus far, but there will be other AI winners as well.\nNow, Nvidia should continue to lead the AI chip market for a while. But the stock has surged 539% over the past three years, and trades at 62 times earnings. Moreover, a slew of competition is heading its way, as the majority of its large customers increasingly look to develop their own in-house accelerators.\nIn light of Nvidia's high valuation and incoming wave of competition, the following AI-related stocks may be better values today.\nThe artificial intelligence buildout is likely to continue strongly for the next few years. And while Nvidia has a near-monopoly on AI chips today, will that continue?\nA large majority of AI training happens in the cloud today, and all major cloud providers are now investing heavily in their own custom AI chips. Even large non-cloud tech companies like Meta Platforms are increasingly designing its own custom AI chips in order to lower costs.\nWhile each cloud provider and Meta have solid chip design capabilities, they all need third-party intellectual property to make a significant portion of their custom AI ASICs (application-specific integrated chips). This is where Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) comes in, providing some key technologies that go into these third-party chips that are produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\nBroadcom already counts Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and TikTok owner ByteDance as customers. Moreover, it's been rumored that even generative AI model leader OpenAI has recruited Broadcom to design a custom chip for its own models.\nBroadcom noted its custom ASIC revenue grew more than 3.5 times, or 350%, year over year last quarter. And CEO Hock Tan said he'd flipped his view about the AI market being dominated by neutral merchant chips like Nvidia's. Now, he sees custom AI ASICs being taken up at a faster pace, saying, \"they [the cloud providers] will all go in that direction totally into ASIC or, as we call it, XPUs, custom silicon.\"\nBroadcom also has other strong businesses in AI networking chips for Ethernet and VMware software, which the company bought in late 2023. These high-growth businesses are now set to make up more than 50% of Broadcom's revenue in short order, which could lead to a growth acceleration.\nMeanwhile, Broadcom's diverse business across many types of chips and software give it ample growth opportunities to expand its empire where it sees fit. Since management has a growth-by-acquisition strategy, that means Broadcom has lots of options as to where it can expand its increasingly AI-focused empire. With a growing 1.2% dividend as a kicker, Broadcom looks like a solid value even after its recent run.\nNo matter if Nvidia leads or other competitors emerge in the AI chip space, next-generation AI chips and memory will all be produced by the same handful of semiconductor equipment companies. Of all these competitively advantaged, high-profit equipment stocks, Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX) looks like a solid bet right now after its recent 10-for-1 stock split and its 15% dividend increase.\nAfter surging earlier this year, Lam sold off with other chip names over the summer. Shares currently reside 29% below their highs set back at last July, and at just 23 times earnings estimates for the fiscal year ending in June 2025.\nThat makes Lam one of the cheaper semicap equipment companies, despite the fact that it's primed for strong earnings growth. Lam specializes in etch and deposition machines that enable the stacking of chip transistors and other chip elements in a vertical fashion. Until recently, the NAND flash industry has made widespread use of verticalization to stack NAND modules on top of each other; while the NAND business became vastly oversupplied in the last few years, leading-edge logic chips, like AI GPUs and CPUs, as well as DRAM memory, are just beginning to use more vertical structures now.\nLam's machines help DRAM makers produce the vertical through-silicon vias (TSV) in high bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI applications, and should see increasing capital spend. HBM itself is also a larger die size, meaning there are fewer dies per wafer, which likely means more wafer expansions and more equipment needed for DRAM chipmakers.\nMeanwhile, Lam's atomic-layer deposition tools are required for gate-all-around transistors, the new type of transistor architecture all logic chipmakers are just beginning to use at the upcoming 2nm node next year. Lam expects an extra $1 billion in revenue from gate-all-around nodes this year, and strong growth above that into next year.\nNext year, as gate-all-around and HBM kicks into high gear, Lam's NAND flash segment should also see incremental growth coming off just about the worst downturn in NAND flash history. With NAND equipment investment having nowhere to go but up and its AI-focused segments primed to take off, Lam looks to be a solid growth story for the next couple of years at least.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Over the past decade, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) rally of approximately 29,530% would have turned a $20,000 investment into $5.9 million. That millionaire-making rally was initially driven by the market's robust demand for its gaming GPUs, but its recent growth spurt was sparked by the explosive AI market -- which drove more companies to buy its newest data center GPUs to process complex machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.\nThe market's demand for Nvidia's data center GPUs is still outstripping its available supply. Analysts expect the chipmaker's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% and 56%, respectively, from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027). Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 36 times next year's earnings -- but it could still face more unpredictable regulatory, macro, and competitive headwinds.\nSo while Nvidia is a great long-term investment in the long-term expansion of the AI market, it might be smart for investors to look beyond the sector's bellwether and check out a few other underappreciated AI stocks. I believe these three other millionaire-making AI stocks are compelling alternatives to Nvidia right now: AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).\nIn 2014, AMD's stock dropped to $3 as it failed to keep up with Intel\u00a0in the CPU market and Nvidia in the GPU market. But if you had invested $20,000 in AMD back then, your investment would be worth $1.1 million today.\nAMD bounced back under CEO Lisa Su, who drove the chipmaker to sell more custom APUs (which merge CPUs and GPUs) for gaming consoles, design more powerful and more power-efficient chips, and shift its production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. It also acquired the programmable chipmaker Xilinx, rolled out more server chips, and expanded its lineup of data center GPUs for accelerating AI tasks. As AMD turned itself around, Intel struggled with persistent delays, production issues, and chip shortages.\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect AMD's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 20% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 102%. That growth should be fueled by its market share gains against Intel in the CPU market, the stable growth of its gaming GPU business, and AI tailwinds for its cheaper data center GPUs. AMD's stock might seem a bit pricey at 50 times next year's earnings -- but its strengths could justify its premium valuation and drive its stock even higher over the next decade.\nSuper Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, was once considered a slow-growth supplier of traditional servers. But if you had invested $20,000 in Supermicro 10 years ago, your investment would have grown to over $2.7 million this March...before shrinking back to about $400,000 today.\nSupermicro is an underdog in the server market, but it carved out a niche by producing high-end liquid-cooled servers. That focus made it an ideal partner for Nvidia, which granted it early access to its high-end data center GPUs to produce dedicated AI servers. It now generates over half of its revenue from its AI servers.\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026 (which ends in June 2026), analysts expect Supermicro's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 46% and 39%, respectively. Those are stunning growth rates for a stock that trades at just 12 times next year's earnings, however, its valuations are being compressed by a short-seller's allegations of accounting issues, a delayed 10-K filing, and rumors of a regulatory probe. Supermicro's stock could bounce back quickly if it resolves those pressing issues.\nIf you'd invested $20,000 in Microsoft 30 years ago, your investment would be worth nearly $2.5 million today. Much of that growth occurred after Satya Nadella took the helm as the tech giant's third CEO in 2014.\nUnder Nadella, Microsoft transformed its desktop-based applications into cloud-based services, expanded Azure's cloud infrastructure platform, and rolled out more mobile versions of its apps for Android and iOS devices. It also expanded its Xbox business, rolled out more hardware devices, and tightly integrated OpenAI's generative AI tools into its ecosystem.\nThat forward-thinking transformation turned Microsoft into a growth stock again. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in June 2027), analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow at CAGRs of 14% and 15%, respectively, as its cloud, mobile, AI, and gaming businesses continue to flourish. Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 27 times next year's earnings, and it could be a much more balanced play on the AI market than Nvidia.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn't the only game in town when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Customers can seek high-performance chips -- and at a lower price -- from rivals like Advanced Micro Devices or Intel, for example. But Nvidia has stood out, and claimed the lion's share of the AI chip market, thanks to its superior performance.\nCustomers are willing to pay more to get ahead in the highly competitive AI race, and that's led to demand for Nvidia's chips surpassing supply. And all of this has translated into triple-digit increases in earnings for the company quarter after quarter and outsized share price gains. Nvidia reported a record $30 billion in revenue in the recent quarter, and the stock has soared 172% so far this year.\nSoon, though, another rival may launch an initial public offering (IPO), a way to raise capital and possibly set it along the path to major growth in the AI chip market. Cerebras Systems late last month filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in preparation for a potential IPO. The company sells an AI processor that could rival Nvidia's current top seller, the H100, and even Nvidia's new Blackwell chip. With this IPO on the horizon, has the AI giant met its match? Let's find out.\nFirst, let's consider Nvidia's Blackwell chip, set for release this year. The Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU) is loaded with 208 billion transistors -- the idea is the more transistors a chip has, the more impressive the speed, memory, and general performance. Customers using the latest NVLink can ensure high levels of communication among as many as 576 GPUs.\nCerebras takes a completely different approach that sets it apart from other chip designers. The company bypasses the idea of linking together many GPUs to do a particular job and instead builds giant chips -- the size of an entire silicon wafer. The Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine, or WSE-3, is the biggest chip ever commercialized. It's 57 times bigger than Nvidia's GPUs and has 52 times more compute cores, 880 times more on-chip memory, and 7,000 times more memory bandwidth.\nThis impressive size allows Cerebras to keep the job on the chip, so customers don't have to link together many GPUs. As a result, they can solve problems faster and use less energy, the company says.\n\"We believe Cerebras has built the world's fastest commercially available AI training and inference solution,\" the company said in its SEC filing.\nAn analyst at Futurum Group took a deep dive into Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip versus WSE-3 technology and reported that Cerebras could indeed be viewed as the fastest -- thanks to top performances in memory and training, and power efficiency over time.\nCerebras is seeing mind-boggling growth, with revenue skyrocketing 1,474% to more than $136 million in the first six months of this year compared with the year-earlier period. The company's gross margin slipped to 41% from 50%, but this was due to a change in the mix of hardware and services revenue -- in the prior year, the company sold more of the higher-margin services offerings.\nAll this shows us that Cerebras' product could be a formidable rival for Nvidia and other chip designers. But does this mean Nvidia has met its match? Not necessarily.\nFirst, it's important to note that Cerebras' IPO may not happen overnight. The company hasn't yet set the number of shares to be offered or the price range and says the offer is \"subject to market conditions.\" So we're in the early stages of the process.\nOn top of this, Reuters reported Cerebras may postpone the IPO after facing delays in a U.S. security review of the UAE-based tech group G42's investment in the company -- the wire service cites people familiar with the matter. This is amid concern that third parties could leak U.S. technology to China -- a country not authorized to access the technology directly.\nIt's also worth noting that G42 is Cerebras' biggest customer, and this reliance on one player represents some risk. Last year, G42 spent more than $65 million as a Cerebras customer, representing 83% of the company's total revenue.\nFinally, it's key to remember that Nvidia has built a solid position in the market, with customers investing in its complete system; this isn't something a customer drops overnight to switch to a competitor. Nvidia's focus on innovation means it's likely to launch fresh, high-performance products often enough to keep customers satisfied. In fact, it's already promised an annual update to its GPUs.\nCerebras' technology sounds exciting and could progressively gain market share, especially after a potential IPO. It is definitely an AI company to watch. But I wouldn't worry about Nvidia losing its top spot anytime soon, meaning now is still a great time to buy and hold shares of this AI giant.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Before October 7",
        "Author": "  Johnny Rice, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's no secret that Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks have dominated the market for the last few years. With firms like PwC -- one of the \"big four\" accounting firms -- making claims that AI could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 -- the hype makes sense.\nThe revolution's poster child, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), saw its stock skyrocket nearly 1000% from late 2022 to today, but the last few months have not been as kind. After reaching its highest peak in June, shares of Nvidia are down about 10%. More significant market fears mixed with slower growth have caused some to cool on the once red-hot stock. So, where to go from here?\nAs the de facto leader of the entire industry, Nvidia needs to continue to do just that: lead. The 2024 AI Summit, which begins October 7, is a chance for the company to bring together some of the biggest faces and best minds in the industry to help push AI forward, all while keeping itself front and center. It's a chance to communicate Nvidia's vision not just to other industry leaders, but to the public at large.\nOne of the primary questions investors have for the company -- and it's a very legitimate one -- is: Are the real-world applications of AI that impactful? Is the incredible cost of AI hardware worth the investment? The summit will be a chance for Nvidia to showcase the myriad ways AI can be used to return real value. It's a chance to justify the enormous cost of its chips and, ultimately, the price of its shares.\nThe event in and of itself is unlikely to move the needle, but it may help ease some fears and get investors thinking about the possibilities and power of AI. Luckily, the event isn't happening in a vacuum. Here are a few reasons why Nvidia is in a prime position to capitalize on the event.\nIn Nvidia's only major snafu since the AI boom took off, the company announced its latest line of chips, dubbed Blackwell, was delayed. Issues in its manufacturing meant they wouldn't be shipped on time. Nvidia assured that shipments would only be delayed a quarter. Despite these reassurances, some investors worried the issues were more fundamental and the delay would be longer.\nIt seems those fears were unfounded. According to a recent report by \u200b\u200bTom's Hardware, the company is ready to ship the first batch as early as December, only about six weeks behind the original schedule, although these reports have yet to be confirmed by Nvidia. If true, it would do a lot to ease investors' fears and show that the company went above and beyond in fixing its mistake.\nStill, even if they don't ship until later in the quarter, the rollout will be huge for the company regardless. Their impact will be felt immediately, with billions in sales expected before the end of its Q4.\nIt's easy to get bogged down in numbers and fixate on balance sheets and income statements, and while these are extremely important when evaluating a business, certain intangibles are often what makes a company great, like vision. Nvidia has it in spades. Under the leadership of CEO Jensen Huang, the company has been at the forefront of several macro movements in tech. Huang saw back in the early 90s that computer graphics would be huge. The company's GPUs -- graphics processing units -- are a big part of what enabled the video game industry to evolve to where it is today.\nThis vision is why the company controls roughly 90% of today's AI chip market. Nvidia saw that its GPUs could do much more than push the bounds of computer graphics; they could power a new technological revolution. It's why the company caught its competition sleeping. Since the current AI boom took off in late 2022, Nvidia's chips have consistently been miles ahead. Other chipmakers have been playing catch-up ever since.\nThere was relative parity between Nvidia and its longtime rival AMD for decades. Not so anymore; last year, Nvidia made more in profit than AMD made in total revenue. The difference right now is stark, but remember, if Nvidia is profiting much more than its rival, it can then afford to spend more on research and marketing to widen its moat and fend off competitors.\nI know I just said not to get bogged down in the numbers, but they are still important. How is the market valuing Nvidia right now? At a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 56, Nvidia isn't cheap, but given its current pace of growth, a trailing P/E isn't really the best metric for us. Its forward P/E -- that is, a P/E that accounts for its expected earnings in the next 12 months rather than the last 12 -- is just above 30. That's not bad in the world of tech. It's just about where Apple and Amazon sit.\nAnother useful valuation is the PEG ratio, which you get by dividing a company's P/E by its expected earnings growth. This is an excellent metric for companies with a lot of growth potential. As a very general rule, a PEG under 1 is what we're looking for. Nvidia's is 0.94.\nNvidia has plenty of room to deliver the kind of growth that can justify its current valuation. To be sure, metrics are not the be-all and end-all. They are imperfect instruments, and of course, metrics that rely on expected earnings are especially imperfect -- the future is anything but guaranteed. I believe Nvidia will continue to outperform the market for some time.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.74 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +85%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.81 points to a change of +116.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.73 indicates a change of +32.8% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $32.59 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +79.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $124.17 billion and $170.63 billion estimates indicate +103.8% and +37.4% changes, respectively.\nNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +122.4%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.27 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.72%. The EPS surprise was +6.25%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) the Best Quality Stock to Buy According to Analysts?",
        "Author": "  Maham Fatima ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Quality Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the best-quality stocks to buy.\nThe stock market has seen a notable 20% increase year-to-date, but as it approaches the seasonally volatile months leading up to Election Day, potential volatility is expected. The S&P 500 has historically pulled back 5% to 10% around election time but tends to recover afterward.\nInstead of cashing out, investors are encouraged to take advantage of any market pullbacks. Historically, when the Fed cuts rates without an impending recession, it creates a favorable environment for broader market performance. Mona Mahajan, Edward Jones senior investment strategist, recently appeared on CNBC to discuss her similar sentiment on these latest market trends, and where investors can find opportunities right now. We talked about this in our article about the\u00a010 Best WallStreetBets Stocks To Buy Right Now, here\u2019s an excerpt from it:\n\u201cWhen asked if investors should consider cashing out and taking a holiday for the remainder of the year, Mahajan advised against such a move. Instead, she suggested that if there are pullbacks or corrections in the market, it would be prudent to lean into those opportunities\u2026 Additionally, rate cuts typically lead to expanded valuations, particularly for sectors that have lagged behind in this regard. She emphasized that lower borrowing costs from Fed rate cuts would benefit both consumers and corporations. In terms of investment strategies during potential downturns, she recommended focusing on cyclical sectors such as utilities and industrials while also maintaining exposure to technology and the artificial intelligence sectors. Mahajan underscored that diversification would be key over the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d\nGlobal Investment Strategist at ProShares Advisors, Simeon Hyman, appeared on CNBC on October 2 to emphasize \u2018income\u2019 as a key focus, highlighting the opportunity in fixed-income markets, which could provide 10-15% returns if geopolitical tensions worsen. He thinks that the US economy is stronger than the rest of the world despite tensions.\nSimeon Hyman emphasized the importance of the term \u2018income\u2019 in the context of current market conditions, noting that the market was just 1% off its all-time highs. This situation presents a salary cut for income-oriented investors, highlighting the challenges they face. However, the fixed-income market offers a silver lining; it currently provides enough yield to cushion against worsening geopolitical tensions. For instance, the yield on the 10-year bond is nearly 4%, and there is potential for it to drop to 3% or lower if significant negative events occur. This scenario presents an opportunity for investors to realize gains of 10% or 15% on bonds in a tumultuous environment, a situation not seen in over a decade.\nDespite the current market being down by 3.7%, which is slightly less than 4%, Hyman insisted that rounding was at play. He expressed surprise at this performance given ongoing geopolitical tensions but pointed out that positive economic news in the US persists. Specifically, there has been a 50-basis point cut and indications of a soft landing for the economy. A month-over-month increase of just 0.1% suggests that if one can overlook geopolitical issues, the US economy is faring better than many others globally and remains on solid economic footing.\nAdditionally, Hyman proposed a covered call strategy focused on the Russell 2000 index, which has been underperforming compared to the S&P 500. He described this strategy as beneficial because it allows investors to generate income that could offset recent losses while maintaining a bullish position in small caps. Historically, rate cuts have positively impacted small-cap stocks, and this strategy enables investors to capitalize on that trend while also generating income through covered calls.\nFor risk-averse investors, the current emphasis on fixed-income markets as a viable investment option aligns well with the insights shared by Simeon Hyman, who highlighted the potential for 10-15% returns in bonds amid geopolitical tensions. Additionally, they may also explore quality stocks with reliable growth histories, which can provide stability in uncertain market conditions, similar to the defensive strategies Hyman suggested.\nMethodology\nTo compile our list, we first sifted through Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF holdings to find the ones with an upside potential of over 15% as of October 4, 2024. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts\u2019 upside potential.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAverage Upside Potential: 22.10%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is known for its high-performance GPUs, which are widely used in gaming, artificial intelligence, data centers, and professional visualization. Its GPUs are essential for powering advanced graphics and computing tasks, and they are a key component in many modern technologies, such as self-driving cars, virtual reality, and supercomputers.\nThe company recently partnered with Accenture. Management recently talked about this partnership and its new AI chip, Blackwell. Blackwell is now being made in large numbers, and there is a lot of demand for it. AI will help businesses innovate faster through the partnership with Accenture. In late August, management also approved a $50 billion share buyback program.\nNetApp released a new AI tool on September 25 that uses NVIDIA technology to help businesses manage their data. Elon Musk\u2019s company, xAI, is using 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs for its AI project, Colossal. Colossal may grow to use H200 GPUs and Blackwell chips in the future.\nIts networking platform for AI, Spectrum X, is expected to be worth billions of dollars within a year. The company recently partnered with Salesforce to help businesses use AI and data better. In September, the company also introduced a new AI tool called Aerial to improve wireless networks for mobile devices, robots, self-driving cars, and 5G.\nIts software called CUDA gives it an advantage over competitors. However, the company\u2019s future depends on continuing to innovate and find ways to make money from AI. CUDA is a tool that helps developers use GPUs for different kinds of computing. Experts think the company should focus more on robotics to grow.\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) \u2013 Following the release of first-quarter earnings in May featuring record revenue growth of 262% year over year, NVIDIA continued its upward march. On June 10, shares of the company began trading on a split-adjusted basis following a 10-for-1 forward stock split, making stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors alike. Just one week later, the company officially surpassed Microsoft in market cap to become the most valuable publicly traded company (although it would relinquish the title not long after). While other companies have also stood to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) trend this year, NVIDIA stands out as the unquestionable leader in the space and that is unlikely to be challenged for many years ahead. NVIDIA continues to see extremely strong levels of demand and the recent introduction of the Blackwell system looks to be an exciting next phase of growth for the stock.\u201d\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the best-quality stocks. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) generated impressive, life-changing returns in just a fairly short time. In five years, the stock has grown by close to 2,800%. To put that in terms of real dollars, a $5,000 investment in the company back then would be worth more than $140,000 right now.\nBut investors may be concerned that the tech stock is too expensive to still be a good buy today. While a massive return over the next five years may be unlikely, there's a strong bullish case to be made for buying Nvidia stock today. Here's why it could have plenty of upside in both the short term and the long term.\nNvidia is constantly innovating and coming out with new chips that can help companies train and develop artificial intelligence (AI) models. It enjoys a dominant market position today and is building on that position as it looks to ensure its lead remains strong.\nThe company's new Blackwell AI chips cost up to $40,000 per unit. Despite the high price, CEO Jensen Huang says demand for them has been \"insane.\" In what may be the clearest sign that the AI boom remains alive and well, Huang told CNBC in an interview recently that companies remain eager to get the latest and greatest chips: \"Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first.\"\nFor investors, that's a great sign that the business is still experiencing high demand for its chips. When Nvidia reported earnings in August, its stock didn't take off despite hitting $30 billion in quarterly revenue for the quarter ending in July and experiencing 122% growth. Expectations may have been a bit too high.\nBut if demand for the Blackwell chips is as strong as Huang is suggesting it is, the company may offer upgraded and stronger guidance for future quarters. That could be just what's needed to send the stock higher this year. Nvidia's next earnings report is expected to come out in November.\nFor long-term investors, there's an even easier case to make as to why it may not be too late to invest in Nvidia. The AI revolution is in its early stages with a lot of businesses developing their own AI models and integrating new technologies into their workflows.\nAnalysts from Grand View Research project that by the end of the decade, the global AI chip market could be worth more than $323 billion as it expands at a compounded annual growth rate of 28.9% until then.\nWith Nvidia being the leader in the AI chip market, it stands to benefit from all that future growth. Even despite the stock's massive gains in recent years, it's trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 34, which may not seem all that expensive for the fast-growing business. Its price-to-earnings-growth ratio of 1 suggests it's a cheap buy even when you factor in the five-year growth that analysts project for the business.\nThere are AI stocks out there that are cheaper than Nvidia, but as the leader in AI chips, it offers investors a fair bit of safety in the long run, knowing they're going with the big brand and top company in the AI chip market. Even if it doesn't generate four-figure returns in the next five years, it still has the potential to be a solid market-beating investment, making Nvidia one of the safer growth stocks you can add to your portfolio today.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you\u2019d have $20,579!*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $42,710!*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $389,239!*\nRight now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee 3 \u201cDouble Down\u201d stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 7, 2024\nDavid Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other widely held stocks.\nThe last trading day of September is upon us and so are many questions about the market. On September 30, Dana D\u2019Auria, Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the financial market.\nD'Auria regards employment data to be a major concern at the moment. Since inflation rates are subsiding, employment data is something investors should be on the lookout for, along with other data points including GDP and consumer confidence. She suggests that to ensure a soft landing, the Fed must initiate larger rate cuts, and that recessionary conditions are out of the picture.\nSeptember is notoriously volatile along with October, and, with elections in another 35 days, the conditions may be slightly different or even more turbulent. According to D'Auria, the 50 basis point cut is a catch-up for July, and expecting a 50 basis point cut in November is borderline questionable.\nOverall, she believes that the market has been overshooting and we may have to settle for two 25 basis point cuts before the end of 2024. She reiterates that the job market is crucial and investors must get out of their comfort zone to invest in non-cash opportunities. Investors concerned about low-risk options may consider equities in the defensive sectors that are innately low volatile.\nWall Street is heading to close September and Q3 on a high note and stocks have experienced their best September in over a decade. On September 30, Kevin Gordon, harles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis.\nGordon believes that stocks in the utilities and defensive sectors have caught up to tech stocks amid the AI boom, compared to their financials at the end of FY 2023. However, he does acknowledge that sectors like industrials, financials, and materials are performing relatively well, calling it a case of market broadening.\nIn terms of market breadth, most sectors are experiencing an upward trajectory. Almost 81% of the S&P 500 members are experiencing an uptrend, despite the quality bias investors may have towards certain stocks. According to Gordon, large-cap quality stocks will continue to perform well despite the volatility and the Fed's decisions. Speaking of smaller-cap stocks, he believes that some stocks may struggle a bit especially when it comes to earnings growth.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 most widely held stocks by hedge funds, we sifted through Insider Monkey's database that tracks over 900 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. We ranked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The GPU maker is known for its cloud solutions, chip systems, and growing role in producing artificial intelligence solutions.\nThe company logged $26.3 billion in data center revenue, up 16% from the previous quarter and 154% year-over-year. The revenue growth was driven by strong demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPU Computing platform. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) logged $30 billion in revenue during the FQ2 of 2025, up by 122% year-over-year, well above its outlook of only $28 billion.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. Such can be attributed to its rapid advancements in technology and strategic partnerships. The company\u2019s networking platform for AI, Spectrum X, is projected to become a multi-billion dollar entity in a year. Moreover, the company just closed a deal with Salesforce allowing organizations to benefit from advanced AI and data capabilities. Two weeks ago, NVIDIA launched a new AI tool, Aerial, to optimize wireless networks that will meet the needs of the next generation on mobile, robots, autonomous vehicles, and 5G.\nAnalysts are bullish on NVDA and their 12-month median price target of $150 points to a 24% upside from current levels. At the close of Q2 2024, 179 investors were bullish on NVDA, with total stakes amounting to $53.7 billion.\nIthaka Group's\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\"\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds.

        "Author": "  Michael del Castillo ",
        "Text": "Long before Fred Smith was the billionaire founder of FedEx, he was a Vietnam veteran with a love of flying and a small fleet of planes for hire. \u201cI would be flying these parts and pieces from Xerox in Rochester to Pittsburgh or wherever the case may be,\u201d he told a gathering of 200 Goldman Sachs executives and entrepreneurs on Thursday. \u201cAnd I would sort of sit in amazement there and say, 'They're hiring me and this whole damn airplane to carry this little part.'\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the likes of early tech giants Burroughs, Sperry, UNIVAC and IBM to hire him and his growing fleet to fly parts from the burgeoning Asian manufacturing market to the rest the world. \u201cWhat I was actually seeing was the beginning of the automation of society,\u201d he said.\nIt was the first time his logistics company found itself at the extreme forefront of tech trends that would change the world.\nSpeaking at Goldman's annual Builders and Innovators Summit in Healdsburg, California, Smith explained how data from the logistics giant that now moves about $2 trillion worth of goods a year in every industry in nearly every country predicted the rise of Tesla and Nvidia and is now seeing into the future of geopolitical tensions and more.\n\u201cWe just have this kaleidoscope of what's going on in the economy,\" he said. \"And so we're able to think we see trends.\u201d\nSmith founded FedEx in 1971 in Little Rock, Arkansas to solve business logistics problems. Since those days when he personally made delivery runs, Smith says the company\u2019s greatest technological breakthrough was software that let it track goods in motion.\n\u201cWe had gotten to the point where we were buying more PCs than any entity in the world,\u201d said Smith. \u201cAnd we were putting them in our customers' offices so the shipping managers could track and trace and prepare the shipping labels.\u201d\nThe company now operates more than 700 aircraft and more than 200,000 motorized vehicles, generating $87.7 billion revenue in fiscal year 2024, and $21.6 billion last quarter. But it\u2019s the data provided by that software that lets FedEx track goods that provides the company with the trend-spotting super-power.\nFor example, Smith says the company is currently shipping Nvidia chips from Guadalajara up the west coast of the United States and pallets from John Deere to Europe. Last year, FedEx added a Danone S.A. executive focused on Mexico to its board of directors, and earlier this year expanded service between the U.S. and Europe, specifically to open up opportunities to China.\nIn fact, Smith highlighted China obstacles and opportunities as another example of a trend FedEx data reveals. \u201cWhat has happened, more than anything else,\u201d he said, \u201cis supply chains have regionalized on a China Plus One basis.\u201d China Plus One is an increasingly popular business strategy which dictates that investors looking to capitalize on China\u2019s booming economy should also invest in another market.\nFor example, he says FedEx is seeing spikes in activity in Eastern Europe, particularly in Hungary and Poland. In southern Mexico, there are 1,000 properties that are either manufacturing plants under construction or fulfillment and distribution centers where there's land in reserve\u2014many of which are owned by Chinese entities.\nSuch interconnectedness that blurs the lines separating nations, complicates the whole idea of imposing sanctions on one nation or another. As a result, Smith is skeptical that the tariffs imposed on imports by both Biden and Trump before him will resolve the geopolitical tension. To support his skepticism, he cites research by the Financial Times that he says shows tariffs slow trade for everyone. Instead, he thinks properly recognizing the interconnectedness of global markets might lead to more measured solutions.\n\u201cEverybody looks at China as a monolithic entity,\" he said. \"There's a business class in China that doesn't want to be wiped out either, as China has become more protectionist. And if you go into a FedEx hub today, you'll be amazed at the choreography of stuff going from every part in the world to every other part in the world.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Outperform Nvidia Over the Next Decade",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco ",
        "Text": "A couple of years ago, semiconductor specialist Nvidia attempted to acquire a little-known company called Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM).\nUnfortunately for Nvidia, the company abandoned the deal as long-winded court cases revolving around antitrust concerns seemed to have no end in sight. Following the failed acquisition, Arm pursued an initial public offering (IPO) \u2014 hitting the Nasdaq last September.\nSince going public, Arm stock has surged 138% on the backdrop of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. But even after such a meteoric rise, I see much better days ahead for Arm. In fact, I think Arm stock will handily outperform Nvidia over the next decade.\nBelow, I'll detail why I'm so bullish on Arm and explain how rising competition in the chip realm could ignite Nvidia's first uphill battle in quite some time.\nThe semiconductor industry has many different components. Not all chip companies make graphics processing units (GPUs) like Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices. There are far more applications for chips, and Arm dominates a pretty singular pocket of the market.\nAt its core, Arm designs chip architecture for mobile devices, consumer electronics, networking equipment inside data centers, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The company makes money from licensing out its intellectual property (IP), and earns a royalty based on its various architectures.\nAs illustrated in the graphic above, Arm's architecture is deeply embedded across various applications. This provides the company with an enviable level of flexibility regarding new chips hitting the market in the future. In other words, companies running on Arm's architecture are less inclined to develop a new hardware and software system that is incongruent with Arm's architecture.\nFurthermore, the slide above shows that Arm's market share has increased across the board over the last two years. With that in mind, I think the company is well positioned to continue benefiting from new chip-based devices, since Arm's IP is already leveraged across so many devices around the world.\nFor this reason, I see Arm as less vulnerable to competitive forces in the chip space compared to peers such as Nvidia.\nLike Arm, Nvidia has a massive presence in its core end market. The company's A100 and H100 chipsets have helped Nvidia acquire an estimated 88% of the GPU market.\nHowever, I see some obvious risks that could expose Nvidia over the next several years, and I would not be surprised to see the company begin to lose market share.\nFirst, companies including Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all investing in their own custom chip designs. Moreover, these companies have been labeled by Wall Street analysts as Nvidia's largest customers \u2014 accounting for nearly half of the company's revenue.\nWhile you could argue that more competition is a good thing for Nvidia, I don't see it that way in this case. These companies will probably remain customers of Nvidia for the next several years, but the introduction of their own hardware could wind up being a bargaining chip in the long run.\nWhat I mean by that is that more GPUs on the market will likely weaken Nvidia's pricing power. In turn, I think Nvidia's revenue and profit growth could have a dramatic slowdown \u2014 a dynamic that growth investors won't want to see.\nBut rising competition isn't the only risk facing Nvidia. Given the company's near-monopoly position, there is a possibility that the Department of Justice (DOJ) could investigate Nvidia's business practices and force the company to loosen up its ecosystem.\nWith so many unknowns revolving around Nvidia's future, I'm skeptical that the stock is a no-brainer at this juncture.\nThere have been many periods of expansion and contraction in Arm's trading activity. But with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 96, it's hard to say the stock is cheap.\nThe forward P/E of the S&P 500 is about 23, less than one-quarter that of Arm.\nHere's how I think about it: The market is clearly placing a premium on Arm stock for a reason. I think there are two core themes to unpack.\nAt a macro level, AI appears to be here for the long run, and technology's biggest companies are committed to spending billions on future artificial intelligence initiatives. While spending will change from year to year, the secular tailwinds presented by AI should bode well for Arm.\nAt a company-specific level, Arm's unique position in the chip space and its lucrative business model suggest that the company's growth will remain robust over time.\nFor these reasons, I see Arm as the superior investment over Nvidia in the next decade. While the stock isn't a bargain, I think it still looks like a compelling opportunity for long-term investors.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is known for inventing, staying ahead of the curve, and surprising the market with its latest innovations. This has helped the company dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, seizing 80% share, and become a general AI powerhouse.\nNvidia isn't about just AI chips anymore. The company sells an entire suite of products and services, from networking to enterprise software, to serve customers with AI projects.\nAll of this has helped Nvidia stock to soar in the quadruple digits over the past five years, and just this year, it's heading for a gain of more than 160%. Nvidia shares may not rise in a straight line forever and have dipped at certain points this year -- but the company still has plenty of fuel in the tank to power spectacular share performance over the long haul.\nThe stock could get a boost from news Nvidia announced just recently. My prediction is that this will be the company's biggest move yet.\nLet's review Nvidia's path so far, just to get an idea of how powerful this company has become in the AI world. Nvidia started out primarily serving the video game market with its graphics processing units (GPUs) but progressively expanded the reach of these chips into other areas, including AI. The GPU's ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously make it the ideal chip for key AI tasks such as the training and inferencing of models.\nNvidia's chips are the fastest around. Even though they're also the most expensive, customers have flocked to the company. Part of the reason may be that customers, eager to win in the AI market, see working with the strongest products right from the start as the best way to reach that goal.\nThey also may agree with Nvidia's Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang on the following point: Nvidia's chips, due to their high performance, will save customers time and make workflows more efficient, resulting in lower total cost of ownership over time. In the long run, Nvidia's chips may represent the best bargain.\nHere's an anecdote to illustrate just how eager big companies are to get in on Nvidia. Recently, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said that he and Tesla chief Elon Musk \"begged\" Nvidia's Huang to sell them more chips. Nvidia has struggled to meet the needs of these companies because demand for its chips has exceeded supply.\nNow let's consider Nvidia's recent move, one that I predict could be its biggest. The tech giant expanded its partnership with Accenture (NYSE: ACN) -- and as part of this, the latter formed the Accenture Nvidia Business Group. This is a team of 30,000 who will help clients jump-start their AI projects and scale the adoption of enterprise AI.\nAs part of this, Accenture AI Refinery -- using the complete Nvidia AI stack -- will help clients reimagine their processes and even develop areas such as sovereign AI. The refinery will be found on all public and private clouds, making it easily accessible.\nThis can be particularly big for Nvidia because it expands the reach of this AI powerhouse even further. And this is in the context of soaring demand for AI from Accenture customers.\nThe consulting and professional services company said in its recently closed fiscal year that generative AI demand drove $3 billion in bookings, and $1 billion of that came in the most recent quarter. It's also important to keep in mind that Accenture is a huge player, with clients in more than 120 countries -- so it has significant reach.\nThis offers Nvidia yet another opportunity to grow its AI market share and further strengthen its reputation as the \"go-to\" company for AI products and services. All of this should equal another big wave of revenue growth.\nThat's why I think this expanded partnership with Accenture will be Nvidia's biggest move yet. It also makes this top AI stock a great player to buy now and hold onto for the long term to potentially benefit from gains to come.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nTom Lee, Fundstrat co-founder, while talking to CNBC in a latest program, explained his bullish case for the market and why he believes the S&P 500 is headed to close the year \u201cwell beyond\u201d 5,700.\n\u201cBull markets are supported by a strong fundamentals and this is a case where not only has the economy survivie extremely high interest rates but the Fed is beginning to cut rates, and an economy that has been sort of languishing has been China. Now we have stimulus and what looks like some bazooka policies that are supporting that region, and we have a lot of cash on the sidelines. I think this is a formula for stocks to do pretty well the next three to 12 months, and that\u2019s why we think that we would be well beyond 5700 before year-end.\u201d\nLee said that he\u2019s inclined to buy \u201crisks outright\u201d as he believes more upward momentum would come for stocks after the election.\n\u201cSmall caps still have good fundamentals, earnings growth is accelerating, the media P/E is eleven times which is almost seven turns lower than the S&P so I think there is still case to be made that small-cap are starting a multi-year gain.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks that are making big moves on the back of latest news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains one of the \u201ctop picks\u201d among large-cap generative artificial intelligence companies, according to William Blair. \u201cThe company has already seen tremendous growth for its GPU and parallel computing systems, and we believe there is time for continued growth, driven by robust training demand from hyperscalers and enterprises, and a ramping inference opportunity,\u201d said William Blair analysts Sebastien Naji and Jason Ader in a detailed investor note.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has also built a strong competitive advantage, with its CUDA software stack being the standard interface for GPUs and AI, Naji added. Both training and inference offer further growth potential as the new Blackwell cycle gets underway.\nNvidia\u2019s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\nAt Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\nOf course, Nvidia won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\nClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThis focus on consistency also guides our regular trimming of strong performers to manage stock-specific and overall portfolio risk. The quarter saw us continue to trim\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), reducing the GPU chipmaker from an active weight in the portfolio to an underweight versus the benchmark. We continue to believe in Nvidia\u2019s 10-year trajectory as hyperscaler and enterprise customers invest in GPU architecture. However, we have reduced our Nvidia position as its valuation now more fully reflects the company\u2019s robust growth path and as estimates have risen to levels that require a very steep growth trajectory to drive further stock appreciation.\u201d\nOverall,\u00a0NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks in October.

Headline inflation rose by 2.4%, slightly above the anticipated 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. Month-over-month, CPI increased by 0.2%, exceeding the forecast of 0.1%.\nCore inflation, excluding food and energy, also came in higher than expected at 3.3%, compared to the anticipated 3.2%, marking a slight increase from August. On a monthly basis, core CPI rose by 0.3%, which matched August\u2019s figures but was above expectations of 0.2%.\nFollowing the report, the market is expecting a 25 basis points rate cut to no rate cuts in the upcoming Fed meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 79.9% of interest rate traders expect the rate cuts to be at 450-475 bps at the coming Fed meeting while 20.1% expect the rate cut to stay the same. At the beginning of the month, 32.1% expected a 50 bps rate cut, while 67.9% anticipated a 25 bps cut.\nDespite the sticky inflation, IBM's vice chair, Gary Cohn believes that the Fed will cut rates by 100 bps this year. In an interview at CNBC's \u2018Money Movers',\u00a0he suggested that the U.S. is experiencing what a soft landing looks like, with inflation decreasing but not steadily. He indicated that reaching the Fed's 2% target will be challenging, as inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around this level.\nCohn noted that for the first time in nearly two decades, the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate, employment, and price stability, after focusing primarily on one at a time. He believes the Fed is making the right decisions and is currently in a delicate position as it missed meeting opportunities this year.\nCohn expects that the Fed will implement a total of 100 basis points in rate cuts this year, likely consisting of 25 basis point reductions over the next couple of months. When asked about inflation targets, he expressed a preference for slightly exceeding the target inflation rate, suggesting that a rate of around 2.2% would be more acceptable in a growing economy than undershooting the target.\nCohn also highlighted concerns about geopolitical risks and said that global tensions could lead to inflationary pressures by disrupting supply chains and increasing shipping costs.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we use stock screeners to identify nearly 30 stocks above $100 billion market cap and $10 billion TTM net income. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks that had a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate of above 10% and were most widely held by institutional investors.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the\u00a010 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other the Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years.\nThe US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve\u2019s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts.\nJamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks\u00a0and\u00a010 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows.\nPowell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month\u2019s half-point cut, but there\u2019s market debate on the pace.\nSoaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop.\nNevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves.\nApart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions.\nAccording to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. \u201cThe bull market has survived the year\u2019s historically weakest quarter,\u201d said Hill in an interview with CNBC. \u201cIt is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.\u201d\nWhen considering which stocks to buy, it\u2019s beneficial to ask, \u201cWhich industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?\u201d Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million.\nSome of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence.\nIn an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves.\nAccording to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward.\nWith this economic perspective in mind, let\u2019s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has made a name for itself as a poster child of the artificial intelligence race and one of the stocks sure to make any investor rich in the next five to ten years. The company is known for producing the most sought-after graphics processing units (GPUs) that can handle more complex workloads, such as training large language models and AI applications.\nStrong demand was the catalyst behind NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), accounting for 98% of shipments of GPUs for data centers last year, and it has a market share of more than 80% for AI chips. One reason the company has achieved such a dominant position is the superior performance of its hardware.\nAdditionally, the CUDA software ecosystem contributes to the company\u2019s success in gaining such a strong market position. Hundreds of software libraries make it easier to develop GPU-accelerated applications with CUDA. Since Nvidia is the only chipmaker offering anything like CUDA, Nvidia GPUs have become the industry standard for data center accelerators.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is anticipated to grow quickly and generate more shareholder value due to the strong demand for AI infrastructure. Grand View Research projects that through 2030, the market for AI accelerators will grow at a rate of 29% annually, while spending on AI services, software, and hardware will compound at a rate of 36% annually. This is encouraging for Nvidia\u2019s investors.\nThe strong demand for the company\u2019s GPUs was the catalyst behind the 122% year-over-year growth in revenue in Q2 to $30 billion. Earnings were up 168% from last year to $0.67 a share. Given that the artificial intelligence race is just starting, it affirms why NVidia is one of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, going by solid financial results.\nAt the close of Q2 2024, 179 investors were bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), down from 186 in the previous quarter.\nIthaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs).

        "Title": "Nvidia vs. Palantir: Which Is the Better Red-Hot AI Stock?",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) have been two of 2024\u2019s hottest stocks \u2014 Nvidia\u2019s 179.6% year-to-date gain has made it the second-most valuable company in the world by market cap, while Palantir\u2019s 153.3% gain has put it on the map as a mega-cap tech stock to be reckoned with, not to mention a new member of the S&P 500 (SPX).\nBoth stocks have benefitted from being key players in the AI revolution. Both companies have exciting futures ahead of them, but there is a key difference between the two that makes one the more compelling opportunity at this point in time. Which looks like the better choice for investors right now?\nNvidia\u2019s 2024 surge has taken it to a relatively high valuation multiple of 47.5 times January 2025 earnings estimates. The S&P 500 trades at 24.7 times earnings, meaning that Nvidia is nearly twice as expensive as the broader market.\nHowever, with consensus earnings per share projected to grow to $4.01 per share for the fiscal year ending in January 2026, Nvidia looks quite a bit more palatable at 33.6 times forward earnings. While this is still fairly expensive, it\u2019s starting to look reasonable enough for a mega-cap powerhouse projected to grow earnings per share by over 40% for the year.\u00a0While Nvidia sometimes catches flack from value-oriented investors for its above-average price-to-earnings multiple, Palantir is even more expensive.\nThe massive 153% YTD gain has pushed shares of Palantir to an incredible valuation of 122.4 times December 2024 earnings estimates. This is more than double Nvidia\u2019s valuation and roughly five times the broader market.\u00a0With the stock expected to grow earnings per share by 19.4% to $0.43 per share for December 2025, the stock\u2019s valuation comes down a bit but is still trading at an exorbitant triple-digit multiple of 100.8 times forward earnings.\nPlus, it\u2019s not just price-to-earnings that makes Palantir look significantly more expensive than Nvidia. When looking at the two stocks on a price-to-sales basis, a popular metric often used for evaluating high-growth names like technology stocks and software stocks, Palantir trades at an astronomical price-to-sales ratio of 35.3, while Nvidia trades for a high but comparatively cheaper 26.3 times sales.\nLastly, it\u2019s worth comparing the two stocks based on their PEG ratios (price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio), a popular valuation metric useful for evaluating growth stocks like Nvidia and Palantir by accounting for earnings growth.\u00a0PEG ratio is calculated by taking a stock\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio and dividing it by its earnings growth rate. The lower the PEG ratio, the better a stock looks by this measure. Investors and analysts who utilize this metric typically view a PEG ratio of 1.0x or less to be undervalued.\nSo, how do Nvidia and Palantir stack up on this basis? Nvidia\u2019s PEG ratio of 1.8 is a bit higher than ideal but not prohibitive. On the other hand, Palantir trades at a significantly higher PEG ratio of 10.4, indicating that it is likely overvalued even when accounting for its earnings growth.\nPalantir is no doubt an exciting company, but it\u2019s hard to sustain a valuation multiple like this, and it leaves little room for error \u2014 if the company falls short of analyst expectations or hits any speed bumps, shares could tumble quickly.\nTurning to Wall Street, NVDA earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months. The average NVDA stock price target of $152.86 implies 10.7% upside potential from current levels.\nSee more NVDA analyst ratings\nTurning to Wall Street, PLTR earns a Hold consensus rating based on four Buys, six Holds, and six Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average PLTR stock price target of $27.67 implies 36.2% downside potential from current levels.\nSee more PLTR analyst ratings\nWall Street analysts are far more constructive on Nvidia, and so is TipRanks\u2019 proprietary Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating. Scores of four, five, six, or seven are considered Neutral, and scores of three or below are considered equivalent to an Underperform rating.\nNvidia boasts an Outperform-equivalent Smart Score of 9.\nMeanwhile, Palantir receives a far less favorable Neutral Smart Score of 4.\nNVDA and PLTR are both high-flying AI stocks, and both are projected to grow earnings significantly in the year ahead. However, Nvidia is projected to grow earnings more than twice as much as Palantir. Despite this, Nvidia shares trade for a far cheaper valuation multiple. Nvidia is often criticized as an \u2018expensive\u2019 stock, but its forward earnings multiple is just a third of Palantir\u2019s double-digit valuation, making it look downright cheap in comparison.\nPlus, sell-side analysts rate Nvidia a Strong Buy and see an upside of 10.7% over the next 12 months, while they are considerably more cautious towards Palantir, rating it a Hold and forecasting a potential downside of 36.4% from current levels. This disparity in analyst views is another strong point in favor of Nvidia.\nI\u2019m bullish on Nvidia based on its significantly cheaper valuation and superior earnings growth, making it the clear-cut winner in this comparison of high-profile AI stocks. For investors looking to capitalize on the generative AI wave, Nvidia continues to look like a smart choice.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "Jensen Huang Was Once Told 'NVIDIA Can Never Be Larger Than A Billion Dollars.' Here's What They Did To Shatter That Ceiling 1,000X Over",
        "Author": "  Adrian Volenik ",
        "Text": "In the early days of NVIDIA, CEO Jensen Huang was told the company would never be worth more than a billion dollars. This bold claim might have discouraged some leaders, but for Huang, it was just the start of a journey to prove the skeptics wrong. Today, NVIDIA has not only surpassed that billion-dollar mark \u2013 it has blown past it by a factor of a thousand.\nSo, how did NVIDIA pull off this incredible feat?\nDon't Miss:\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nNVIDIA started out making powerful gaming processors. Still, Jensen Huang had a bigger idea and saw that NVIDIA\u2019s technology could be applied to more than just graphics for video games. In an interview, Huang shared, \"A long time ago, I was told that NVIDIA could never be larger than a billion dollars. Obviously, that was an underestimation, underimagination of the size of the opportunity.\"\nInstead of limiting itself to producing chips, NVIDIA has created platforms for particular sectors, including health care, AI or the metaverse. NVIDIA now offers complete solutions that integrate hardware, software and AI models, allowing it to capture massive new markets that extend far beyond its origins in graphics processing.\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nAt a GTC conference a few years back, Huang clarified that platforms \u2013 not just chips \u2013 are NVIDIA's future. For example, the Omniverse Enterprise platform allows companies to collaborate in a 3D digital space, creating \"digital twins\" of everything from cars to entire factories. These digital simulations are revolutionizing industries by increasing accuracy and speeding up development.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s most significant shift came when the company moved into AI. Huang's vision for AI was far bigger than just building chips for computers. Instead, he saw the potential for AI to reshape industries entirely. He explained that rather than just thinking about how many chips are needed for AI, it's about what those chips do.\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\"If you built a system that assisted in the driving of the car, what's the value of an autonomous chauffeur every now and then? Now the opportunity becomes much larger,\" said Huang. This thinking allowed NVIDIA to tap into enormous markets, from self-driving cars to AI-driven health care.\nStill, one of the most exciting areas where NVIDIA has extended its platform leadership is in autonomous vehicles (AVs). NVIDIA has created a comprehensive AV platform with tools for everything from data gathering and mapping to simulation and driving assistance. A synthetic data replicator is also included in their AV platform to expedite the training of AI models for self-driving automobiles.\nSee Also: Unlock a $400 billion opportunity by investing in the future of EV infrastructure on this startup already valued at $50 million with just $500.\nNVIDIA has been developing an end-to-end platform for AVs for several years now. Nobody comes close. This platform approach ensures NVIDIA is well ahead of competitors, who are still trying to get their chips to market. By offering a complete solution, NVIDIA has established itself as a leader in the autonomous vehicle space.\nNVIDIA\u2019s growth is continuing as the company develops. From just making chips, they have evolved into a platform business that provides solutions for some of the most innovative technology available today, such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars. Huang noted that \"the market size is enormous. It's measured in trillions,\" and NVIDIA is positioned to capture a significant share of that.\nRead Next:\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "Title": "4 Billion-Dollar Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Right Now",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has soared over the past five years as the company solidified its dominance in the high-growth artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. The tech giant holds about 80% of that market thanks to the power of its graphics processing units (GPUs) \u2014 their ability to process multiple tasks simultaneously makes them perfect for critical AI tasks like the training of models.\nSales of chips and other AI products and services has helped Nvidia grow its data center revenue in the triple digits to record levels. In the most recent quarter, revenue from that business topped $26 billion. This is huge, considering that revenue for the entire company totaled $27 billion as recently as fiscal 2023.\nAfter such earnings and stock performance, though, you may be wondering if it's too late to get in on this AI player and if the biggest opportunity for gains has passed. It's impossible to predict with 100% accuracy whether Nvidia will repeat its past performance. But it is fair to say earnings growth drivers not only still exist but have multiplied \u2014 and as earnings soar, so could the stock price. Let's check out four billion-dollar reasons to buy Nvidia now \u2014 each is set to add major growth to Nvidia's top line moving forward.\nNvidia has generally stood behind its InfiniBand platform for networking, or the transmission of data across various devices. But Ethernet networking remains more broadly used due to compatibility across device types. Not to be left out, Nvidia launched its Spectrum-X Ethernet platform last year, a move that allows the company to continue to grow InfiniBand and gain ground in the Ethernet market too.\nIn the most recent quarter, Nvidia's Ethernet for AI revenue doubled from the previous quarter as \"hundreds of customers\" signed on for the company's Ethernet offerings. In fact, Spectrum-X is set to become a multibillion-dollar range of products after just one year of commercialization. And since the company aims to release new Spectrum-X products every year, there's reason to be optimistic about future growth.\nSovereign AI refers to a country's ability to generate AI through its own infrastructure and resources \u2014 it's particularly valuable because it means a nation can preserve and harness the strengths of its culture, traditions, language, and more.\nThis new area represented zero revenue for Nvidia last year, but this year it's already on its way to delivering revenue in the low-double-digit billions. Examples of Nvidia's work in the area include projects to build supercomputers with Japan and Italy \u2014 and even a project with a French company to build Europe's biggest supercomputer.\nNvidia spoke about the importance of sovereign AI as the movement began, and it's clear the opportunity could bring in major revenue as various nations launch projects \u2014 and turn to Nvidia for help.\nWhen Nvidia announced the upcoming release of its new Blackwell architecture and chip, Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk's comment illustrated the importance of the chip designer in his industry: \"There is currently nothing better than Nvidia hardware for AI,\" Musk said. On top of this, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison recently said he and Musk begged Nvidia for more chips during a meeting with CEO Jensen Huang \u2014 Nvidia has said demand for its GPUs has surpassed supply.\nThe automotive industry was a big growth driver for Nvidia during the recent quarter because every developer of self-driving technology is using Nvidia products. The company predicts the industry will result in \"multibillion dollars\" in revenue \u2014 and this revenue will climb as more and more compute is needed for next-generation vehicles.\nAI may revolutionize many areas, but Nvidia's Huang predicts the technology will make the biggest mark on healthcare. At the company's GTC conference earlier this year, Huang highlighted that Nvidia is already present in various specialties \u2014 from imaging to gene sequencing and robotics.\nAt the conference, Huang announced the launch of about two dozen new services spanning the areas of imaging, speech recognition, and drug discovery. And in the recent earnings report, Nvidia said healthcare is \"on its way\" to becoming a multibillion-dollar business for the company.\nAll of these elements show us that Nvidia's revenue growth has much farther to go. And each of these areas represents a long-term opportunity, meaning we're not just talking about a quarter or two of revenue growth but growth that could persist over time. And that's why these are four fantastic billion-dollar reasons to buy Nvidia stock today.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), has an important message for anyone who wants success \u2013 resilience is more important than you think. Huang gave a tip that helped him succeed when he spoke at the 2024 SIEPR Economic Summit \u2013 have low expectations.\nDon't Miss:\nBeating the market through ethical real estate investing' \u2014 this platform aims to give tenants equity in the homes they live in while scoring 17.17% average annual returns for investors \u2013 here\u2019s how to join with just $100\n\u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\u201cOne of my great advantages is that I have low expectations,\u201d Huang said. It might sound strange, but Huang thinks having low expectations helps build resilience, which he says is crucial for success. \u201cPeople with very high expectations have very low resilience \u2013 and, unfortunately, resilience matters in success.\u201d\n\nSee Also: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nHuang\u2019s life shows how true this is. He moved from Taiwan to the U.S. when he was nine years old, faced bullying at his school in Kentucky and started working as a busser at Denny\u2019s when he was 15. At Denny\u2019s, the idea for Nvidia \u2013 a company now worth $3.3 trillion \u2013 began to take shape.\nFrom washing dishes to leading one of the most valuable tech companies in the world, Huang says his journey was shaped by the challenges he faced and his determination to keep going even when things got tough.\nTrending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to teach it to you except for I hope suffering happens to you,\u201d Huang told Stanford students earlier this year, showing that he believes hardship is necessary to build character. He explained, \u201cGreatness comes from character and character isn\u2019t formed out of smart people. It\u2019s formed out of people who suffered.\u201d\nHuang also said that resilience isn\u2019t just a personal trait \u2013 it is a big part of Nvidia\u2019s culture. He often jokes with his team about \u201cpain and suffering,\u201d saying that he wants to build character within the company.\nSee Also: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion \u2013 they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nAnd that\u2019s why he said to the auditorium: \u201cFor all of you Stanford students, I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering.\u201d\nEven with Nvidia\u2019s incredible growth \u2013 including a stock increase of almost 200% in the past year and $30 billion in revenue last quarter \u2013 Huang stays humble. He often jokes about how he started just trying to be the best dishwasher at Denny\u2019s, calling his journey \u201cthe most extraordinary thing that a normal dishwasher busser could grow up to be this.\u201d\nIn a world where many people aim high and expect fast rewards, Huang's story reminds us that our experiences mold who we are.

        "Author": "  Ryan Vlastelica ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.\u2019s shares are roaring back after the company successfully calmed investor concerns about product delays and its long-term growth prospects.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHow Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought\nDubai\u2019s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City\u2019s Infrastructure\nThe Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan\u2019s Capital Is No Longer Working\nAs Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization\nThe Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City\u2019s Populous Outskirts\nThe stock is up almost 14% this month, including a 2.4% gain on Monday that resulted in its first record close since June, though it remains below an intraday peak. It\u2019s the second-best performer in the S&P 500 Index this year.\nListen to the Bloomberg Daybreak Europe podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\nRecent strength came after CEO Jensen Huang said Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chip \u201cis in full production,\u201d and that demand for it \u201cis insane,\u201d comments that came after Blackwell was delayed due to engineering snags, prompting a selloff that has now been erased. In addition, a report last week from Morgan Stanley analysts who met management said that Blackwell orders \u201care booked out 12 months or so,\u201d with \u201cevery indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility.\u201d\nThe comments cement the view that Nvidia is still a favored way to invest in artificial intelligence, especially as major companies remain committed to their AI initiatives. Microsoft Corp., for example, is projected to boost capex spending by nearly a third in fiscal 2025 to about $58 billion, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cThere had been questions about the impact production delays could have, so these updates are reassuring,\u201d said Zehrid Osmani, portfolio manager at Martin Currie Investment Management.\nBeyond the Blackwell optimism, recent sales from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. showed strong AI demand, while a funding round for OpenAI resulted in a $157 billion valuation. OpenAI recently released an AI model with reasoning capabilities, something Alphabet Inc. is also working on.\nThese events \u201chave driven a reinvigoration of interest in the space, and people are really getting excited about the use cases for reasoning-based AI,\u201d said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. \u201cReasoning represents a new area for Nvidia, and when you consider how compute-intensive it is, this could be a huge new product category.\u201d\nBelton views Nvidia as a core holding and sees AI offering \u201ca steady drumbeat of demand\u201d for years. \u201cIt\u2019s not an undiscovered stock, but the valuation is still reasonable if it can deliver the numbers that are expected.\u201d\nAnalysts expect Nvidia\u2019s revenue to more than double in its current fiscal year, and rise another 44% the following one, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Street has continually raised estimates for Nvidia\u2019s earnings and profit over the past quarter.\nNvidia\u2019s strong growth prospects have kept its valuation in check, helping bulls support their case to keep buying. It trades above 37 times estimated earnings, which represents a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, but is below its five-year average and under a June peak of more than 44 times.\n\u201cNvidia still looks formidable,\u201d said Osmani, of Martin Currie. \u201cIt remains really well positioned to harness the AI opportunity.\u201d\nSigns of optimism have also been flashing in the options market. On Thursday, there was a wave of purchases in calls that allow holders to buy more than 30 million shares at levels from $150 to $189 through March. Nvidia closed at $138.07 on Monday.\nThe cost of calls relative to bearish put options \u2014 known as the skew \u2014 has fallen, making it cheaper to bet on a further rally. The contracts won\u2019t expire until after Nvidia\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings release, expected in late February.\n\u201cThe stock will remain volatile and orders will be lumpy,\u201d said Dan Flax, managing director and senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman. \u201cBut so long as Nvidia executes on its product road map, that will drive the kind of healthy growth that keeps the stock attractive.\u201d\nTech Chart of the Day\nTesla Inc. shares fell 8.8% on Friday in the wake of its Robotaxi event, with the stock dropping near a key technical level. The shares closed only slightly above their 100-day moving average, a level it has held above since June. Breaking under it would be a negative sign for medium-term momentum trends. Shares rose 0.6% on Monday.\nTop Tech Stories\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official, as the chipmaker expands its global footprint.\nTPG Telecom Ltd. agreed to sell its fiber assets and the company\u2019s fixed business serving enterprise, government and wholesale customers to Vocus Group Ltd. in a deal valued at A$5.25 billion ($3.5 billion).\nSouth Korea\u2019s exports of technology products slowed for a second straight month in an indication global demand may be peaking out, according to government data that also showed memory-chip shipments and prices losing momentum.\nApple Inc. is finally preparing to compete for the smart home market after falling behind Amazon and Google. For years, Apple has sold the go-to devices for our pockets, wrists, backpacks and desks.

        "Title": "Prediction: Nvidia Could Be Headed to $150 in 2025",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been one of the market's top performers in recent years, soaring a mind-boggling 2,600% over the past five. And this year, the trend continues with Nvidia stock heading for a 150% gain. All of this is thanks to the company's dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, where it holds more than 80% share.\nAnd Nvidia hasn't stopped there but has developed a broad range of AI products and services, helping the company deliver billions of dollars in earnings quarter after quarter. In fact, Nvidia has been on a roll, growing quarterly revenue in the triple digits year over year. So now, the natural question is: With all of this positive momentum, where is Nvidia's stock going to land in 2025?\nToday, Nvidia shares trade for about $124 following the company's 10-for-1 stock split in June. A stock split doesn't change the total value of a company but lowers the price of each individual share through the issuance of new shares to current shareholders. This makes it easier for a broader range of investors to access the stock. From this new price level, my prediction is Nvidia could be headed to $150 next year as gains continue but potentially at a slower pace than in recent times. Let's find out more.\nFirst, some background on Nvidia. The company sells graphics processing units (GPUs) used to power many tasks -- from gaming to AI. Gaming actually was Nvidia's biggest business a few years ago, but as the AI boom accelerated, so did Nvidia's AI business. Data-center revenue, accounting for 87% of Nvidia's total revenue, came in at more than $26 billion in the most recent quarter -- a record and a triple-digit gain from the prior year.\nOther companies sell AI chips, but Nvidia's are particularly sought-after due to their speed -- they're the fastest around, and Nvidia says this high performance can save customers money over the long term. So, while they pay more for a Nvidia GPU today, they're likely to have a lower-total cost of ownership over time.\nCompanies developing major AI projects clearly are on board because demand for Nvidia's soon-to-launch architecture Blackwell is surpassing supply. Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang says he expects this trend to continue well into next year even as Nvidia works night and day to bring supply to the highest levels possible. In a recent interview with CNBC, Huang even said demand for the company's new Blackwell chip is \"insane.\"\nAll of this should support the idea of more gains for Nvidia stock. The company predicts that after ramping production of Blackwell in the fourth quarter, Nvidia also should see \"several billion dollars\" in revenue from the platform in that quarter too. We also should expect a clear picture of how the demand for Blackwell translates into earnings in the following quarters throughout 2025.\nIf Nvidia is able to serve most of the demand and generate growth from Blackwell from quarter to quarter, I would expect investors to continue flocking to the stock. It's also important to keep in mind that Nvidia isn't cheap, but it isn't excessively expensive for a growth stock either -- at 44 times forward-earnings estimates -- especially considering potential for growth down the road thanks to the company's market leadership and focus on innovation to keep its top spot. So Nvidia stock could increase in valuation from today's level and still remain reasonably priced.\nNow let's talk market value. If Nvidia were to increase to $150 next year, market cap would reach $3.6 trillion, roaring past the value of market giant Microsoft, today worth $3.09 trillion. But it's important to keep in mind that Microsoft, too, may climb next year, keeping it ahead of Nvidia. In any case, I would expect the two companies, both building solid positions in the high-growth area of AI, to remain neck and neck when it comes to market value over the coming year.\nFinally, my prediction of an increase to $150 represents a gain but only about 20% from today's level. That isn't much compared to this year's winnings so far. I'm not any less positive on Nvidia than I was earlier in the year. But stocks generally don't soar nonstop without any slowdown in the pace from time to time, and Nvidia, considering its enormous advance over the past few years, now may enter a phase of more measured increases.\nAnd this is actually positive because it would show that Nvidia stock isn't a bubble ready to burst but instead a player that has what it takes to deliver lasting gains over the long haul.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "In the early days of NVIDIA, CEO Jensen Huang was told the company would never be worth more than a billion dollars. This bold claim might have discouraged some leaders, but for Huang, it was just the start of a journey to prove the skeptics wrong. Today, NVIDIA has not only surpassed that billion-dollar mark \u2013 it has blown past it by a factor of a thousand.\nSo, how did NVIDIA pull off this incredible feat?\nDon't Miss:\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nNVIDIA started out making powerful gaming processors. Still, Jensen Huang had a bigger idea and saw that NVIDIA\u2019s technology could be applied to more than just graphics for video games. In an interview, Huang shared, \"A long time ago, I was told that NVIDIA could never be larger than a billion dollars. Obviously, that was an underestimation, underimagination of the size of the opportunity.\"\nInstead of limiting itself to producing chips, NVIDIA has created platforms for particular sectors, including health care, AI or the metaverse. NVIDIA now offers complete solutions that integrate hardware, software and AI models, allowing it to capture massive new markets that extend far beyond its origins in graphics processing.\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nAt a GTC conference a few years back, Huang clarified that platforms \u2013 not just chips \u2013 are NVIDIA's future. For example, the Omniverse Enterprise platform allows companies to collaborate in a 3D digital space, creating \"digital twins\" of everything from cars to entire factories. These digital simulations are revolutionizing industries by increasing accuracy and speeding up development.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s most significant shift came when the company moved into AI. Huang's vision for AI was far bigger than just building chips for computers. Instead, he saw the potential for AI to reshape industries entirely. He explained that rather than just thinking about how many chips are needed for AI, it's about what those chips do.\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\"If you built a system that assisted in the driving of the car, what's the value of an autonomous chauffeur every now and then? Now the opportunity becomes much larger,\" said Huang. This thinking allowed NVIDIA to tap into enormous markets, from self-driving cars to AI-driven health care.\nStill, one of the most exciting areas where NVIDIA has extended its platform leadership is in autonomous vehicles (AVs). NVIDIA has created a comprehensive AV platform with tools for everything from data gathering and mapping to simulation and driving assistance. A synthetic data replicator is also included in their AV platform to expedite the training of AI models for self-driving automobiles.\nSee Also: Unlock a $400 billion opportunity by investing in the future of EV infrastructure on this startup already valued at $50 million with just $500.\nNVIDIA has been developing an end-to-end platform for AVs for several years now. Nobody comes close. This platform approach ensures NVIDIA is well ahead of competitors, who are still trying to get their chips to market. By offering a complete solution, NVIDIA has established itself as a leader in the autonomous vehicle space.\nNVIDIA\u2019s growth is continuing as the company develops. From just making chips, they have evolved into a platform business that provides solutions for some of the most innovative technology available today, such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars. Huang noted that \"the market size is enormous. It's measured in trillions,\" and NVIDIA is positioned to capture a significant share of that.\nRead Next:\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "Author": "  Adria Cimino ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has soared over the past five years as the company solidified its dominance in the high-growth artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. The tech giant holds about 80% of that market thanks to the power of its graphics processing units (GPUs) \u2014 their ability to process multiple tasks simultaneously makes them perfect for critical AI tasks like the training of models.\nSales of chips and other AI products and services has helped Nvidia grow its data center revenue in the triple digits to record levels. In the most recent quarter, revenue from that business topped $26 billion. This is huge, considering that revenue for the entire company totaled $27 billion as recently as fiscal 2023.\nAfter such earnings and stock performance, though, you may be wondering if it's too late to get in on this AI player and if the biggest opportunity for gains has passed. It's impossible to predict with 100% accuracy whether Nvidia will repeat its past performance. But it is fair to say earnings growth drivers not only still exist but have multiplied \u2014 and as earnings soar, so could the stock price. Let's check out four billion-dollar reasons to buy Nvidia now \u2014 each is set to add major growth to Nvidia's top line moving forward.\nNvidia has generally stood behind its InfiniBand platform for networking, or the transmission of data across various devices. But Ethernet networking remains more broadly used due to compatibility across device types. Not to be left out, Nvidia launched its Spectrum-X Ethernet platform last year, a move that allows the company to continue to grow InfiniBand and gain ground in the Ethernet market too.\nIn the most recent quarter, Nvidia's Ethernet for AI revenue doubled from the previous quarter as \"hundreds of customers\" signed on for the company's Ethernet offerings. In fact, Spectrum-X is set to become a multibillion-dollar range of products after just one year of commercialization. And since the company aims to release new Spectrum-X products every year, there's reason to be optimistic about future growth.\nSovereign AI refers to a country's ability to generate AI through its own infrastructure and resources \u2014 it's particularly valuable because it means a nation can preserve and harness the strengths of its culture, traditions, language, and more.\nThis new area represented zero revenue for Nvidia last year, but this year it's already on its way to delivering revenue in the low-double-digit billions. Examples of Nvidia's work in the area include projects to build supercomputers with Japan and Italy \u2014 and even a project with a French company to build Europe's biggest supercomputer.\nNvidia spoke about the importance of sovereign AI as the movement began, and it's clear the opportunity could bring in major revenue as various nations launch projects \u2014 and turn to Nvidia for help.\nWhen Nvidia announced the upcoming release of its new Blackwell architecture and chip, Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk's comment illustrated the importance of the chip designer in his industry: \"There is currently nothing better than Nvidia hardware for AI,\" Musk said. On top of this, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison recently said he and Musk begged Nvidia for more chips during a meeting with CEO Jensen Huang \u2014 Nvidia has said demand for its GPUs has surpassed supply.\nThe automotive industry was a big growth driver for Nvidia during the recent quarter because every developer of self-driving technology is using Nvidia products. The company predicts the industry will result in \"multibillion dollars\" in revenue \u2014 and this revenue will climb as more and more compute is needed for next-generation vehicles.\nAI may revolutionize many areas, but Nvidia's Huang predicts the technology will make the biggest mark on healthcare. At the company's GTC conference earlier this year, Huang highlighted that Nvidia is already present in various specialties \u2014 from imaging to gene sequencing and robotics.\nAt the conference, Huang announced the launch of about two dozen new services spanning the areas of imaging, speech recognition, and drug discovery. And in the recent earnings report, Nvidia said healthcare is \"on its way\" to becoming a multibillion-dollar business for the company.\nAll of these elements show us that Nvidia's revenue growth has much farther to go. And each of these areas represents a long-term opportunity, meaning we're not just talking about a quarter or two of revenue growth but growth that could persist over time. And that's why these are four fantastic billion-dollar reasons to buy Nvidia stock today.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before the Blackwell Launch? 1 Incredibly Important Detail May Give You the Answer.",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the most important pieces of generative artificial intelligence (AI) development is sophisticated chipsets called graphics processing units (GPUs). Right now, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) absolutely dominates the GPU realm thanks to its A100 and H100 chipsets.\nWhile these products contributed to record revenue and profit growth for Nvidia over the last couple of years, the company's new Blackwell series GPUs could wind up being its biggest product yet.\nWith Blackwell set to launch later this year, is now a good time to buy Nvidia stock? Below, I'll reveal one clue that could help in making your decision.\nCEOs are more than just executives who sit atop the organizational structure. They are often masters at marketing, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is no exception.\nDuring a recent interview on CNBC, Huang said that demand for Blackwell is \"insane\" and that \"everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first.\"\nAll things considered, early signs indicate that Nvidia will have no problem selling its Blackwell GPUs. But with so much potential on the horizon, I just can't help but fixate on one peculiar statistic.\nThe term \"insider\" is applied to people such as members of a company's board of directors or senior executives. Entities or investors owning over 10% of the company are also considered insiders.\nMany of Nvidia's insiders have been selling the stock throughout 2024. Granted, much of the activity stems from terms of automatic sales protocols agreed upon in the past. However, there's one thing surrounding Nvidia's insider activity that I can't seem to get over.\nAccording to public records, the last time an insider at Nvidia bought stock was back in December 2020, when the company's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, bought 200 shares on the open market.\nI fully understand that rules set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pertaining to insider buying and selling are stringent. Right now, it's highly likely that Nvidia's insiders know a lot of details surrounding Blackwell that are not yet public.\nThis could include production volumes, purchase orders, backlog trends, and more. For this reason, it would look a little nefarious if an insider made a massive purchase of the stock as the Blackwell launch looms.\nHowever, let's zoom out and think about the bigger idea here.\nThe prospects of AI have been the primary pillar of Nvidia's bull thesis for a couple of years now. Moreover, developing a successor product to the H100 was not an overnight project. Considering those points, insiders had the opportunity to scoop up shares in anticipation that Nvidia's research and development (R&D) investments would bear fruit at some point down the road.\nLooked at from another perspective, insiders may be cashing out because they think Nvidia's share price is unlikely to be an outsize multibagger again over the next couple or even several years. When you layer on top that big-name hedge funds run by Ken Griffin, David Shaw, and David Tepper have also been offloading Nvidia stock, I'm hard-pressed to see a reason to buy shares at the moment.\nI believe Blackwell will serve as a near-term catalyst for Nvidia's growth.

        "Text": "Just as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares approached the all-time high set in June, the stock has begun to reverse course today. Shares were down as much as almost 7% as of about 10:40 a.m. ET Tuesday, with several recent news items apparently scaring investors.\nOne thing that likely spooked some shareholders was reports that the Biden administration was discussing capping sales of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips supplied by Nvidia and other U.S. companies to some countries. At the same time, semiconductor equipment maker ASML warned investors of weaker China sales expected over the next year.\nBut reading deeper into each of these news items and looking at what Nvidia offers customers should have investors wondering whether today's pullback is, in fact, a good opportunity to buy Nvidia stock.\nAstute investors know that Nvidia has faced headwinds in the past. Export restrictions to China, slumping demand in the cryptocurrency mining sector, production delays, and increased competition have all affected its business. But even with that competition, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for its newest, next-generation Blackwell AI chip is \"insane.\"\nNvidia's first-mover status is just one reason customers keep placing orders for its new AI chips. Another important factor is how Nvidia has designed its entire AI platform. Nvidia's architecture is based on its CUDA software kit. CUDA, or Compute Unified Device Architecture, is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface the company developed.\nCUDA enables systems to ingest AI data to accelerate the training of more AI data. Huang recently described it as a flywheel effect. It allows older versions of its chips to maintain usefulness as the newer, more powerful chips are used to help large language models build AI inference data.\nThat is to say, Nvidia has a competitive moat that can help continue to push growth in revenue and earnings. That makes today's pullback a good chance for investors to either start or add to positions in the stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- As Nvidia Corp. found itself the target of a deep selloff earlier this year, Impax Asset Management was quietly seizing the moment to build a stake it had long regretted not owning.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSan Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes\nThe Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City\u2019s Populous Outskirts\nChicago\u2019s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World\u2019s Most Unequal Nation\nShould Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters?\nIan Simm, chief executive officer and founder of the $50 billion London-based asset manager, says he and his team had been looking for an opportunity to correct what they had come to realize was a wrong call a few years ago, which meant missing out on Nvidia\u2019s stunning 800% rally since the beginning of 2023.\n\u201cWe just underestimated the market potential of their product,\u201d Simm said in an interview. Impax had been looking for a way in, but Nvidia \u201cwas expensive.\u201d That is, \u201cuntil it had a selloff.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s share-price slump earlier this year resulted in a peak-to-trough decline in its market value of close to $1 trillion. Though much of that has since been recouped, Simm says he thinks the company\u2019s current valuation of more than $3.2 trillion still understates what it\u2019s really worth.\nEstablished in 1998, Impax has made a name for itself as a giant among asset managers focused on the transition to a more sustainable economy. Simm says that goal should be compatible with making money for his clients. But it\u2019s been a tough sell of late.\nOver the past couple of years, a spike in interest rates, an energy crisis and the ascent of the so-called Magnificent Seven of technology behemoths have turned green investing into a losing bet. Impax\u2019s own share price is down almost 30% this year, while the S&P Global Clean Energy Index has lost more than 10%. The S&P 500, meanwhile, is up more than 20% in the same period.\nImpax recently reported results that showed gains in listed equities of \u00a35.3 billion ($6.9 billion) for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. That was less than the \u00a35.8 billion of net outflows that Impax saw in the period.\nA few years ago, Simm says there was a \u201cbig debate\u201d at Impax on the merits of piling into Nvidia. The case around artificial intelligence was \u201cspeculative at the time,\u201d he said. Back then, the asset manager concluded that Nvidia\u2019s technology was largely limited to the gaming industry and therefore the asset manager decided against going big on investing.\n\u201cFrankly, we\u2019ve underperformed for the last couple of years in our main strategies because we\u2019ve been more growth-at-a-reasonable-price, staying away from the momentum and hype around mega-cap tech investing,\u201d he said.\nAs Nvidia\u2019s share price was falling in June, Impax more than tripled its stake in the company to 4.9 million shares by the end of the month from 1.4 million shares at the end of the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and confirmed by Impax.\nSimm says Impax still considers Nvidia to be undervalued when taking into account how the boom in artificial intelligence is expected to drive demand for its chips.\nSimm says holding Nvidia, which like other technology giants needs to consume vast stores of energy to power its growth, also makes investing sense from a climate perspective. As demand for energy continues to increase, Nvidia and other companies that develop more efficient models will be better for the environment, he says.\nNvidia\u2019s Blackwell chips, which are beginning to roll out to customers this year, would need 3 gigawatts of power to develop OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 software, the company said at an event earlier this month. Ten years ago, that process would have required 5,500 gigawatts, the chipmaker said.\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s ability to deliver energy savings makes it even more valuable,\u201d Simm said.\nNvidia is emitting greenhouse gasses at a pace that exceeds levels needed to limit global warming to the critical threshold of 1.5C. Back in April, Morningstar analysts estimated the company\u2019s so-called implied temperature rise was 3.8C.\n\u201cYou can still make money from investing in society\u2019s response to too much CO2 emissions while still being bearish about what the net result\u2019s going to be,\u201d Simm said. Impax looks \u201cfor growth at a reasonable price rather than from an ethical perspective or the non-financial impact.\u201d\nExceeding the thresholds in the Paris climate agreement is \u201ca risk issue.\u201d\nBut \u201cpricing should sort that out, if countries are moving ahead with internalizing the cost of CO2 emissions,\u201d he said.\nImpax holds Nvidia in five strategies and funds. That includes its Global Opportunities portfolio, which is limited to 40 stocks and consists of companies that have a diversified business model, operate in high-growth markets and are \u201cout of favor for whatever reason,\u201d Simm said. Microsoft Corp. is included because Impax thinks it\u2019s undervalued \u201cin the context of the secular trend toward more AI,\u201d he said.\nIn fact, \u201cthe whole industrial space\u201d now looks undervalued, Simm said. That may change as a \u201csoft landing in the US\u201d looks increasingly likely, which is helping restore confidence, he said. The cost of capital is falling and consumer sentiment is stabilizing, so equity \u201cis looking more attractive.\u201d\n(Adds Nvidia implied temperature rise, CEO comments in final paragraphs.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nLina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes)\nWhy Is It So Hard for Clothing Resale Platforms to Make Money?\nMusk Reveals Why He\u2019s Jumping Into Trump\u2019s Arms\nChina Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space\nHow Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA): Hedge Funds Are Bullish On This NASDAQ Stock Right Now",
        "Author": "  Maham Fatima ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Performing NASDAQ Stocks in 2024.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other great performing NASDAQ stocks.\nFed's recent cut has resulted in significant outperformance in the tech sector, signaling a positive sentiment among investors. Tech stocks are thriving in this lower interest rate environment, which has contributed to a broader market rally. The strength of small-cap stocks and cyclical sectors was noticeable even before the reduction, suggesting that market confidence was building. Analysts expect ongoing growth driven by advancements in AI, which continues to be a key theme influencing investor behavior.\nThe occurrence of rate cuts while markets are at record highs raises important questions about potential volatility. Historically, markets have shown resilience and often continue to rise even when rate cuts occur near market peaks. This suggests that much of the current optimism may already be reflected in stock prices. The recent rate cut is generally viewed as a preventive measure rather than a direct response to economic weakness, which could further enhance consumer confidence and spending.\nTowards the end of September, RaeAnn Mitrione, Investment Management Partner at Callan Family Office, appeared in an interview and highlighted significant market developments following the Fed\u2019s unexpectedly larger-than-anticipated rate cut. We covered this in detail in our article on the 7 Cheap Technology Stocks To Buy Right Now, here's a short excerpt from it:\n\u201c...Mitrione emphasized that the market is reacting favorably to lower interest rates, particularly benefiting the tech sector... Pointing at a chart, Mitrione remarked that it is unusual to see rate cuts while markets are at record highs, raising questions about potential volatility ahead. Historically, even when rate cuts occur near market peaks, stocks often continue to rise. Much of this positive sentiment has been priced in due to prior indications of the rate cut. She explained that the economy remains strong, and the rate cut serves as a preventive measure rather than a reaction to economic weakness. This supportive environment could enhance consumer confidence and spending, further improving market performance.\u201d\nOn September 28, DataTrek Research co-founder, Nick Colas, joined an interview on CNBC to discuss the trading day and highlight that the tech rally will have to wait until year-end. As September ended, the S&P 500 saw a remarkable increase of 20% year-to-date. In light of this performance, market participants began revisiting the post-Fed rate cut playbook following the initial easing. Nick Colas noted that one of the most encouraging aspects of September is that the market has not experienced a decline, which is typically expected during this month known for its volatility. Instead, the S&P had risen by 1.6% so far in September, demonstrating resilience despite some initial choppiness, which is particularly noteworthy given September's historical reputation for turbulence.\nAs Colas noted, on the macroeconomic front, positive indicators are emerging. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model has revised its Q3 growth estimate upward to 3.1%, signaling that the economy is performing well. Additionally, gasoline demand has increased by 6% year-over-year, reflecting strong consumer activity. Initial jobless claims reported recently also show a solid performance, falling below the three-year average. These data points support the mid-cycle playbook employed by DataTrek, suggesting that the economy is continuing to progress without any significant cracks or fissures in its foundation.\nDespite these positive trends, questions remain about whether the market can sustain its momentum without new positive catalysts. Colas pointed out that historically, price-to-earnings multiples and stock prices tend to rise together as long as there are no major negative catalysts to disrupt the economic recovery. This correlation indicates that investor confidence remains intact and is likely to persist through the remainder of the year. Furthermore, as the market approaches traditionally strong months following elections, there are expectations for a potential old Santa Claus rally in December.\nHowever, with the volatility index elevated at around 17 and geopolitical tensions looming, especially as elections approach, investors are likely to remain cautious. Over the past two years, the NASDAQ 100 has surged approximately 67%, marking a significant recovery since its lows in October two years ago. This performance is substantially above the historical average return of around 25%. Colas emphasized that while such returns are impressive, they do not yet indicate speculative excess; historically, a doubling of the NASDAQ over two years would signal potential trouble for investors.\nLooking back further, Colas noted that since peaking before the bear market in November 2021, the NASDAQ 100 has only risen about 20% over three years. This suggests that there may still be room for growth compared to prior bubbles when returns were much more pronounced within shorter time frames.\nThe ongoing rotation away from technology stocks has been observed recently, with cyclical sectors and financials performing well. Colas believes this trend may continue for now, with a potential resurgence in tech stocks expected closer to November and December as year-end approaches. Investors appear to be favoring cyclical sectors at present, which offer more immediate upside opportunities.\nWhile there are challenges ahead, the current economic indicators suggest a robust environment for continued growth in equities as long as investor confidence remains high and no major negative catalysts emerge to derail progress. Despite a recent rotation away from tech stocks, the market remains resilient, with the potential for a tech resurgence as we approach year-end, setting the stage for a bullish outlook for both tech and the NASDAQ in the coming months.\nWhen optimism about economic conditions or technological advancements rises, tech stocks typically perform well, boosting the NASDAQ.\nMethodology\nWe used stock screeners to look for companies listed on NASDAQ that were trading over $10 billion. We then selected the top 10 NASDAQ stocks with the best year-to-date performance and that were also the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their year-to-date performance.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nYear-to-Date Performance as of October 2: 136.26%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading player in the semiconductor industry that designs and manufactures GPUs for the gaming, data center, and professional visualization markets. Its GPUs are widely used for rendering graphics, accelerating AI applications, and powering HPC workloads. The company has also expanded into other areas, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality.\nThe company holds ~80% of the global market share in GPU semiconductor chips. In the second fiscal quarter of 2025, the company achieved a remarkable 122.40% year-over-year revenue growth. Data center revenue surged 54% year-over-year, fueled by robust demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers accounted for approximately 45% of data center revenue.\nCollaborations with healthcare institutions and the growing demand for AI-driven diagnostic solutions have fueled this robust financial performance. In late August, management also approved a $50 billion share buyback program.\nOn September 25, NetApp introduced a new AI-powered data solution utilizing NVIDIA technology, enhancing its unified storage operating system and benefiting thousands of enterprises. Elon Musk's xAI launched Colossal is powered by 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Colossal is expected to expand with H200 GPUs and potentially Blackwell chips. Despite challenges in product launches and GPU pricing, NVIDIA's focus on AI monetization and sustainability positions it for long-term growth.\nAlthough CUDA software provides a competitive edge, the company's future relies on continued innovation and effective AI monetization. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and API that allows developers to utilize the power of GPUs for general-purpose processing. Market analysts anticipate a shift toward robotics for the company's growth. Management forecasts low-double-digit billion AI revenue this year.\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) \u2013 Following the release of first-quarter earnings in May featuring record revenue growth of 262% year over year, NVIDIA continued its upward march. On June 10, shares of the company began trading on a split-adjusted basis following a 10-for-1 forward stock split, making stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors alike. Just one week later, the company officially surpassed Microsoft in market cap to become the most valuable publicly traded company (although it would relinquish the title not long after). While other companies have also stood to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) trend this year, NVIDIA stands out as the unquestionable leader in the space and that is unlikely to be challenged for many years ahead. NVIDIA continues to see extremely strong levels of demand and the recent introduction of the Blackwell system looks to be an exciting next phase of growth for the stock.\u201d\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best performing NASDAQ stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

It\u2019s the second-best performer in the S&P 500 Index this year.\nListen to the Bloomberg Daybreak Europe podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\nRecent strength came after CEO Jensen Huang said Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chip \u201cis in full production,\u201d and that demand for it \u201cis insane,\u201d comments that came after Blackwell was delayed due to engineering snags, prompting a selloff that has now been erased. In addition, a report last week from Morgan Stanley analysts who met management said that Blackwell orders \u201care booked out 12 months or so,\u201d with \u201cevery indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility.\u201d\nThe comments cement the view that Nvidia is still a favored way to invest in artificial intelligence, especially as major companies remain committed to their AI initiatives. Microsoft Corp., for example, is projected to boost capex spending by nearly a third in fiscal 2025 to about $58 billion, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cThere had been questions about the impact production delays could have, so these updates are reassuring,\u201d said Zehrid Osmani, portfolio manager at Martin Currie Investment Management.\nBeyond the Blackwell optimism, recent sales from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. showed strong AI demand, while a funding round for OpenAI resulted in a $157 billion valuation. OpenAI recently released an AI model with reasoning capabilities, something Alphabet Inc. is also working on.\nThese events \u201chave driven a reinvigoration of interest in the space, and people are really getting excited about the use cases for reasoning-based AI,\u201d said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. \u201cReasoning represents a new area for Nvidia, and when you consider how compute-intensive it is, this could be a huge new product category.\u201d\nBelton views Nvidia as a core holding and sees AI offering \u201ca steady drumbeat of demand\u201d for years. \u201cIt\u2019s not an undiscovered stock, but the valuation is still reasonable if it can deliver the numbers that are expected.\u201d\nAnalysts expect Nvidia\u2019s revenue to more than double in its current fiscal year, and rise another 44% the following one, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Street has continually raised estimates for Nvidia\u2019s earnings and profit over the past quarter.\nNvidia\u2019s strong growth prospects have kept its valuation in check, helping bulls support their case to keep buying. It trades above 37 times estimated earnings, which represents a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, but is below its five-year average and under a June peak of more than 44 times.\n\u201cNvidia still looks formidable,\u201d said Osmani, of Martin Currie. \u201cIt remains really well positioned to harness the AI opportunity.\u201d\nSigns of optimism have also been flashing in the options market. On Thursday, there was a wave of purchases in calls that allow holders to buy more than 30 million shares at levels from $150 to $189 through March. Nvidia closed at $138.07 on Monday.\nThe cost of calls relative to bearish put options \u2014 known as the skew \u2014 has fallen, making it cheaper to bet on a further rally. The contracts won\u2019t expire until after Nvidia\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings release, expected in late February.\n\u201cThe stock will remain volatile and orders will be lumpy,\u201d said Dan Flax, managing director and senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman. \u201cBut so long as Nvidia executes on its product road map, that will drive the kind of healthy growth that keeps the stock attractive.\u201d\nTech Chart of the Day\nTesla Inc. shares fell 8.8% on Friday in the wake of its Robotaxi event, with the stock dropping near a key technical level. The shares closed only slightly above their 100-day moving average, a level it has held above since June. Breaking under it would be a negative sign for medium-term momentum trends. Shares rose 0.6% on Monday.\nTop Tech Stories\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official, as the chipmaker expands its global footprint.\nTPG Telecom Ltd. agreed to sell its fiber assets and the company\u2019s fixed business serving enterprise, government and wholesale customers to Vocus Group Ltd. in a deal valued at A$5.25 billion ($3.5 billion).\nSouth Korea\u2019s exports of technology products slowed for a second straight month in an indication global demand may be peaking out, according to government data that also showed memory-chip shipments and prices losing momentum.\nApple Inc. is finally preparing to compete for the smart home market after falling behind Amazon and Google. For years, Apple has sold the go-to devices for our pockets, wrists, backpacks and desks.

        "Title": "Prediction: Nvidia Could Be Headed to $150 in 2025",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been one of the market's top performers in recent years, soaring a mind-boggling 2,600% over the past five. And this year, the trend continues with Nvidia stock heading for a 150% gain. All of this is thanks to the company's dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, where it holds more than 80% share.\nAnd Nvidia hasn't stopped there but has developed a broad range of AI products and services, helping the company deliver billions of dollars in earnings quarter after quarter. In fact, Nvidia has been on a roll, growing quarterly revenue in the triple digits year over year. So now, the natural question is: With all of this positive momentum, where is Nvidia's stock going to land in 2025?\nToday, Nvidia shares trade for about $124 following the company's 10-for-1 stock split in June. A stock split doesn't change the total value of a company but lowers the price of each individual share through the issuance of new shares to current shareholders. This makes it easier for a broader range of investors to access the stock. From this new price level, my prediction is Nvidia could be headed to $150 next year as gains continue but potentially at a slower pace than in recent times. Let's find out more.\nFirst, some background on Nvidia. The company sells graphics processing units (GPUs) used to power many tasks -- from gaming to AI. Gaming actually was Nvidia's biggest business a few years ago, but as the AI boom accelerated, so did Nvidia's AI business. Data-center revenue, accounting for 87% of Nvidia's total revenue, came in at more than $26 billion in the most recent quarter -- a record and a triple-digit gain from the prior year.\nOther companies sell AI chips, but Nvidia's are particularly sought-after due to their speed -- they're the fastest around, and Nvidia says this high performance can save customers money over the long term. So, while they pay more for a Nvidia GPU today, they're likely to have a lower-total cost of ownership over time.\nCompanies developing major AI projects clearly are on board because demand for Nvidia's soon-to-launch architecture Blackwell is surpassing supply. Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang says he expects this trend to continue well into next year even as Nvidia works night and day to bring supply to the highest levels possible. In a recent interview with CNBC, Huang even said demand for the company's new Blackwell chip is \"insane.\"\nAll of this should support the idea of more gains for Nvidia stock. The company predicts that after ramping production of Blackwell in the fourth quarter, Nvidia also should see \"several billion dollars\" in revenue from the platform in that quarter too. We also should expect a clear picture of how the demand for Blackwell translates into earnings in the following quarters throughout 2025.\nIf Nvidia is able to serve most of the demand and generate growth from Blackwell from quarter to quarter, I would expect investors to continue flocking to the stock. It's also important to keep in mind that Nvidia isn't cheap, but it isn't excessively expensive for a growth stock either -- at 44 times forward-earnings estimates -- especially considering potential for growth down the road thanks to the company's market leadership and focus on innovation to keep its top spot. So Nvidia stock could increase in valuation from today's level and still remain reasonably priced.\nNow let's talk market value. If Nvidia were to increase to $150 next year, market cap would reach $3.6 trillion, roaring past the value of market giant Microsoft, today worth $3.09 trillion. But it's important to keep in mind that Microsoft, too, may climb next year, keeping it ahead of Nvidia. In any case, I would expect the two companies, both building solid positions in the high-growth area of AI, to remain neck and neck when it comes to market value over the coming year.\nFinally, my prediction of an increase to $150 represents a gain but only about 20% from today's level. That isn't much compared to this year's winnings so far. I'm not any less positive on Nvidia than I was earlier in the year. But stocks generally don't soar nonstop without any slowdown in the pace from time to time, and Nvidia, considering its enormous advance over the past few years, now may enter a phase of more measured increases.\nAnd this is actually positive because it would show that Nvidia stock isn't a bubble ready to burst but instead a player that has what it takes to deliver lasting gains over the long haul.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Tech led US stocks higher on Thursday as TSMC's (TSM) upbeat outlook eased worries about artificial intelligence chip demand, helping lift shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) to an intraday all-time high. Strong retail sales data also reinforced overall strength in the US economy.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose just over the flatline, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) ticked below it, after briefly touching an intraday record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.4% to hover near all-time highs.\nContract chipmaker TSMC posted a 54% jump in quarterly profit to beat Wall Street estimates and raised its forecast for 2024 revenue growth amid surging AI demand. The outlook boost from the main chipmaker for Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia reassured a market spooked by ASML's (ASML) downbeat sales forecast, reviving hopes for an AI boom.\nTSMC's US-listed shares climbed about 10%, crossing a $1 trillion market valuation. Its forecast helped spur a rally in chip stocks, including Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia, which all were up more than 2%.\nOn the data front, retail sales jumped 0.4%, more than the 0.3% rise expected, giving credence to the argument the economy could be reaccelerating following a surprisingly strong September jobs report. Weekly jobless claims came in at 241,000, far below expectations, and a drop from the prior week's upwardly revised 260,000. The data released Thursday morning was watched by investors debating whether the Federal Reserve will hold off from cutting interest rates in November.\nAfter a stellar showing by big banks, the focus is now on Big Tech earnings to wipe away the disappointments of the last quarter.

A week earlier, it was 6.32%.\nAs Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports, mortgage rates have been on the rise as markets adjust expectations about the size and pace of future Federal Reserve rate cuts.

Apple iOS 18 users can now use Affirm's installment loan service intended to help users with larger purchases.\nThe move lower in Affirm stock follows a rally in the past two weeks, as four Wall Street analysts upgraded their ratings on the stock to Overweight or Equal Weight. Of the analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, some 10 recommend buying the stock, while 10 have an Equal Weight rating, and two maintain a Sell rating, Bloomberg data shows.\nDespite Affirm's decline Thursday, the stock is up more than 30% from three months ago, as shares rallied following the company's most recent earnings report, which topped expectations.

Spot gold also rose to a daily high just north of $2,690.\nYear to date, gold is up more than 30%, beating out the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gain of roughly 22%.\nThe expectation that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates coupled with central banks' accumulation of the yellow metal has made gold one of the best-performing commodities of 2024.\nHomebuilders are feeling more confident about the housing market despite a recent sharp rise in mortgage rates.\nThe National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose two points to 43 in October from the previous month, marking the second consecutive monthly gain. October\u2019s reading was higher than economists\u2019 estimates of 42, per Bloomberg data.\nStill, any reading under 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good.\n\u201cWhile housing affordability remains low, builders are feeling more optimistic about 2025 market conditions,\u201d NAHB Chairman Carl Harris, a custom homebuilder from Wichita, Kan., said in a press release.\nMortgage rates have been rising recently, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed rate loan climbing to 6.32% last week from 6.12% a week earlier in the biggest week-over-week increase since April., according to Freddie Mac. Mortgage rates, which tend to follow US Treasury yields, have been recently moving upward as strong job growth and persistent inflation leads traders to pare back their expectations on how aggressively the Fed will cut interest rates.\nThe NAHB survey also showed more builders offered concessions in October. The survey found that 62% of builders used some sort of sales incentive to close the deal, up from 61% in September. Meanwhile, 32% of builders cut home prices to bolster sales in October, similar to last month. The average price reduction was 6%, up from 5% last month.\nThe gauge measuring sales outlook over the next six months rose 4 points to 57. The prospective-buyer traffic gauge and the NAHB index of current sales conditions also both gained two points in October.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) touched record intraday highs on Thursday morning, gaining roughly 0.3% and 0.4% respectively.\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.6%, with Technology (XLK) leading the gains.\nLucid shares tanked more than 14% on Thursday morning after the luxury electric vehicle maker announced a stock offering to raise about $1.67 billion.\nYear to date, Lucid shares are down more than 32%.\nThe major averages rose on Thursday with tech stocks leading the gains after chipmaker TSMC's (TSM) upbeat outlook helped send the semiconductor sector higher.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%.\nStrong economic data also helped lift stocks. September's retail sales rose 0.4% versus estimates of 0.3% \u2014 a sharp increase from August's 0.1% rise.\nMeanwhile, jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 12 came in at 241,000, versus estimates of 259,000.\nSeptember's retail sales rose 0.4% versus estimates of 0.3% \u2014 a sharp acceleration off August's 0.1% growth.\nMeanwhile, jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 12 came in at 241,000, versus estimates of 259,000.

        "Title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Strong Buy as Hedge Fund Investments Surge and AI Opportunities Expand",
        "Author": "  Ashar Jawad ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of Renaissance Technologies Portfolio: 10 Best Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other best stocks to buy which are part of the Renaissance Technologies portfolio.\nRenaissance Technologies is an American hedge fund that specializes in systematic trading and employs statistical and mathematical tools to drive its investment programs. As of March 2024, the fund managed discretionary assets over\u00a0$89 billion, according to their Form ADV. It was founded in 1982 by Jim Simons, a mathematician who worked as a code breaker for the US National Security Agency during the Cold War.\nSimons is considered among the pioneers of quantitative investing. At the time of his death in May 2024, he had an estimated net worth of $31.4 billion, making him the 51st richest person in the world. His use of mathematical models and algorithms to drive long-term investment returns earned him a legacy that rivaled the likes of Warren Buffet and George Soros.\nHis signature Medallion generated average annual returns of 66% for three decades between 1988 and 2018, earning more than $100 billion in profits during the period. The fund started with charging a 5% fixed fee and also had performance charges of 20%, which were later increased to 44% in 2002. Despite those cuts, Medallion earned annual returns of around 39% on average.\nThe fund was closed to outside investors in 1993 and has since then only been available to past and current employees, and their families. Renaissance Technologies does have other funds that are open to outsiders, such as Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF) and Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha (RIDA).\nSimons stepped down from active management of Renaissance Technologies in 2010 and resigned as its executive chairman in 2021. Peter Brown is the current CEO of the capital market company. He graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics from Harvard University and also holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. Brown\u2019s father, Henry B.R. Brown, invented the Reserve Primary Fund in 1970, which was the first money market fund to be set up.\nBrown is committed to the use of mathematical models to discover and unlock the value of stocks in the market. However, Renaissance hedge funds that are open to outside investors have been shrinking for some while. According to a recent report in the Financial Times, RIEF currently manages around $19.6 billion, significantly down from $35.8 billion in 2020. The collapse of RIDA and Renaissance Institutional Diversified Global Equities (RIDGE) has been even worse. The two funds were merged this year. In 2019, RIDA managed about $15 billion, while RIDGE had a portfolio of $14.3 billion. Today, the combined fund manages only $3.6 billion.\nAs a result, Renaissance\u2019s external assets under management have declined from $65.1 billion in 2019 to $23.2 billion today. Much of the exodus happened following the coronavirus pandemic and was driven by a shock performance by the hedge fund as the stock market rattled. In contrast, the Medallion Fund, which is limited to past and current employees, gained 76% in 2020 despite Covid-19. This is because the fund indulges in high-frequency trading with a lower capacity, a strategy that is strikingly different from those applied for external funds.\nHowever, the performance of external funds is beginning to stabilize after the lows over the last few years. RIEF is up 19.8% this year, while RIDA has also gained 17.4%. Though financial experts believe the improvement is owed more to the fund\u2019s performance, rather than flows.\nWe scanned Renaissance Technologies\u2019 13F portfolio, as of June 30, 2024 and picked the top 10 stocks according to their stake value.\u00a0The figures were sourced from\u00a0Insider Monkey Database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nStake Value as of Q2 2024: $867,494,208\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a software and fabless company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Its share price has soared by over 2000% in the last five years, fueled by strong demand for graphics processing units (GPU) and AI models. It remains the go-to company for cloud computing firms looking for GPUs and semiconductors as they expand investments in artificial intelligence, and this has been a critical catalyst behind NVIDIA\u2019s financial growth.\nThe company continues to drive robust results and had another impressive quarter during Q2 FY25, in which revenue increased 122% year-over-year to reach $30 billion, beating forecasts of $28 billion. Net income totaled $16.6 billion with an EPS of $0.68, going past analyst expectations of $0.645. The strong show during the quarter was attributed to a surge in demand for data center chips.\nNVIDIA anticipates revenue in Q3 to be around $32.5 billion, with gross margins between 74.4% to 75%. It also expects continued revenue growth from its Blackwell and Hopper Architecture products during the backend of the year. There is consensus among Street analysts on the stock\u2019s Strong Buy rating. They also expect an 18% upside in its share price. Having said that, if the market matures and growth fails to meet expectations, that could lead to a downward turn in the share price.\nMost investors, however, remain bullish on the stock. According to Insider Monkey\u2019s database, 179 hedge funds had investments in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as of Q2 2024. Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding the company in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including data center acceleration, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefited from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\nNVIDIA is one of the\u00a0best stocks to buy from the Renaissance Technologies portfolio. The hedge fund has a stake valued at over $867 million in the company, as of June 30, 2024.\nOverall, NVDA ranks 3rd among the Renaissance Technologies Portfolio: 10 Best Stocks To Buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Why Nvidia, AMD, Arm Holdings, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Sank on Tuesday",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Since early last year, investors have been bullish about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI), scooping up shares of companies best positioned to profit from this next-generation technology. However, as the bull market crosses the two-year mark, many are taking a step back to survey the landscape, and some are looking for any excuse to take profits.\nWith that as a backdrop, chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) slumped 6.7%, AI chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) tumbled 4.9%, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) sank 4.8%, semiconductor device supplier Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) fell 3.7%, and chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u00a0(NYSE: TSM)\u00a0dipped 2.6%, as of 12:50 p.m. ET on Tuesday.\nThe catalyst that sent these AI stocks lower were reports the U.S. government is considering new curbs on chip exports.\nThe Biden administration is considering limiting sales of advanced AI processors from Nvidia, AMD, and other companies, according to a report that first appeared in Bloomberg, citing \"people familiar with the matter.\" This would mark the most recent step by regulators to address concerns that advanced technology like AI could be used against the U.S. and its interests.\nThe government is discussing a cap on the number of export licenses for certain countries, citing national security as the reason for the potential move. It's worth noting that the U.S. already has strict limits on the level of AI chip technology it allows to be sold to some countries, including China and 40 other countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\nCurrently, U.S. chipmakers are required to obtain government licenses to sell advanced semiconductors to customers in certain countries. The current deliberations would extend the existing curbs, which might be set on a country-by-country basis, with an emphasis on countries within the Persian Gulf region.\nThe considerations are still in the early stages, and no final decision has been reached, but the plans have been \"gaining traction in recent weeks,\" according to the report.\nLimiting the sales of advanced AI chips to certain countries has potential implications for all of these AI-centric stocks:\nNvidia is the leading provider of the graphics processing units (GPUs) used to facilitate AI systems. The company controls as much as 98% of the data center GPU market, according to semiconductor analyst firm TechInsights. As such, it has the most to lose.\nAMD has long battled with Nvidia for GPU supremacy and has recently decided to prioritize AI processors, with its legacy gaming chips taking a back seat. Curbs on advanced processors could dent those ambitions.\nArm Holdings provides the intellectual property and chip designs used for some of the world's most advanced chips, including those used by Nvidia and AMD. If sales of these processors are severely curbed, Arm Holdings' revenue could take a hit.\nBroadcom provides a number of products that work side by side with GPUs in the data center, including Ethernet switching and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), to accelerate the movement of data. If sales of GPUs falter, sales of complementary products like Broadcom's could suffer as well.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, also called TSMC, is the world's leading foundry, responsible for 62% of the world's semiconductors and an estimated 90% of the advanced processors used for AI. Any curbs on the sale of processors would trickle down to TSMC, crimping its revenue.\nWhile investors fear a hit to Nvidia's (and others') sales, history suggests they may be overreacting. There were similar concerns on multiple other occasions when the U.S. government considered or announced curbs on chips to countries like China. Despite those fears, Nvidia went on to generate triple-digit growth for five consecutive quarters. Furthermore, recent reports suggest the company's Blackwell chips are sold out for the next 12 months. This suggests that, potential curbs aside, demand for AI chips remains robust.\nThen, there are valuations to consider. Arm Holdings, AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom, and TSMC are selling for 96 times, 46 times, 46 times, 36 times, and 28 times forward earnings, respectively. For those looking for a good value, TSMC is likely the only one worth buying, but this doesn't account for the accelerating growth trajectory resulting from AI. Using the more appropriate forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in that growth -- reveals that each of the remaining stocks boasts a multiple of less than 1, the standard for undervalued stocks.\nIt's still early days for the adoption of generative AI, and while some experts peg the market value at $1.3 trillion, others believe the total could be much higher. For investors looking to profit from AI, the best strategy is to buy the best AI stocks you can find and hold tight for the long term.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before the Blackwell Launch? 1 Incredibly Important Detail May Give You the Answer.",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the most important pieces of generative artificial intelligence (AI) development is sophisticated chipsets called graphics processing units (GPUs). Right now, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) absolutely dominates the GPU realm thanks to its A100 and H100 chipsets.\nWhile these products contributed to record revenue and profit growth for Nvidia over the last couple of years, the company's new Blackwell series GPUs could wind up being its biggest product yet.\nWith Blackwell set to launch later this year, is now a good time to buy Nvidia stock? Below, I'll reveal one clue that could help in making your decision.\nCEOs are more than just executives who sit atop the organizational structure. They are often masters at marketing, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is no exception.\nDuring a recent interview on CNBC, Huang said that demand for Blackwell is \"insane\" and that \"everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first.\"\nAll things considered, early signs indicate that Nvidia will have no problem selling its Blackwell GPUs. But with so much potential on the horizon, I just can't help but fixate on one peculiar statistic.\nThe term \"insider\" is applied to people such as members of a company's board of directors or senior executives. Entities or investors owning over 10% of the company are also considered insiders.\nMany of Nvidia's insiders have been selling the stock throughout 2024. Granted, much of the activity stems from terms of automatic sales protocols agreed upon in the past. However, there's one thing surrounding Nvidia's insider activity that I can't seem to get over.\nAccording to public records, the last time an insider at Nvidia bought stock was back in December 2020, when the company's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, bought 200 shares on the open market.\nI fully understand that rules set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pertaining to insider buying and selling are stringent. Right now, it's highly likely that Nvidia's insiders know a lot of details surrounding Blackwell that are not yet public.\nThis could include production volumes, purchase orders, backlog trends, and more. For this reason, it would look a little nefarious if an insider made a massive purchase of the stock as the Blackwell launch looms.\nHowever, let's zoom out and think about the bigger idea here.\nThe prospects of AI have been the primary pillar of Nvidia's bull thesis for a couple of years now. Moreover, developing a successor product to the H100 was not an overnight project. Considering those points, insiders had the opportunity to scoop up shares in anticipation that Nvidia's research and development (R&D) investments would bear fruit at some point down the road.\nLooked at from another perspective, insiders may be cashing out because they think Nvidia's share price is unlikely to be an outsize multibagger again over the next couple or even several years. When you layer on top that big-name hedge funds run by Ken Griffin, David Shaw, and David Tepper have also been offloading Nvidia stock, I'm hard-pressed to see a reason to buy shares at the moment.\nI believe Blackwell will serve as a near-term catalyst for Nvidia's growth. After the launch, I'd keep a keen eye out to see whether insiders continue selling or if someone finally buys shares after so many years without doing so. Should that happen, it could signal that insiders think Nvidia stock is attractively valued and has significant upside.\nAt the end of the day, I am sort of thinking that Blackwell will ignite some short-lived pops in Nvidia stock, making it a lucrative trading opportunity. But as a long-term investor, I'd encourage shying away from trading or buying into momentum and instead seeking steady, gradual winners that can last several years.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

It represents a tiny percentage of the company\u2019s 24.5-billion outstanding shares, but the sales are coming at a time when investors are already on edge about Nvidia\u2019s delayed Blackwell chips and the longevity of artificial intelligence-related spending.\nMore sales are planned. While Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang recently completed the sale of 6 million shares under a pre-arranged trading plan, a trust controlled by director Mark Stevens has filed to sell 3 million additional shares, on top of the 1.6 million he sold this year prior to that filing.\nA representative for Nvidia declined to comment on insider sales.\n\u201cIt definitely doesn\u2019t inspire confidence when you see that level of insider sales but I would definitely couch that in what else is going on,\u201d said Mike Bailey, director of research at Fulton Breakefield Broenniman. For investors looking at whether now is a good time to buy Nvidia shares \u201cthis is probably one less reason for someone to make a new purchase.\u201d\nThe biggest seller this year has been Huang, whose 10b5-1 plan was adopted in March. These plans pre-determine sales on certain dates and aren\u2019t tied to news or share-price moves. There is typically a three-month waiting period before the first sale is allowed under a 10b5-1 plan.\nHuang unloaded about $713 million of shares between mid-June and mid-September under that plan \u2014 a period when Nvidia shares fell about 5% amid a rotation out of Big Tech and increased scrutiny of the AI frenzy.\nEven after executing the plan, Huang still holds Nvidia shares worth more than $100 billion.\nOther big sellers include Stevens and fellow director Tench Coxe, who have sold shares this year worth a total of about $390 million and $525 million, respectively.\nThere have been numerous other pressures on Nvidia shares in the past few months. The biggest factor has been concerns about how long heavy spending on AI computing will continue, according to Denny Fish, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get the verdict as we start getting into 2025 and see the numbers as Blackwell is released,\u201d he said, referring to the new processor line which Nvidia has projected will contribute several billion dollars in sales in the fourth quarter.\nNvidia shares have been on a roller coaster ride since June, when the company\u2019s market capitalization briefly topped Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. to become the world\u2019s most valuable company. Since then, they\u2019ve suffered two drawdowns of more than 20% amid concerns about tech giants\u2019 spending on AI. Still, the stock has rallied back each time and is now about 10% from the June 18 peak.\nAnd while more insider selling is on the horizon, investors shouldn\u2019t necessarily read sales \u2014 especially pre-planned ones \u2014 as a sign of bearishness.\n\u201cWhether CEOs are buying or CEOs are selling in the long run, it\u2019s not a really good correlation to how the stocks can perform,\u201d said Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer at Mahoney Asset Management. \u201cThe CEO of Nvidia is not selling stock because he thinks the growth is slowing down. He thinks just the opposite.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nOpenAI has completed a deal to raise $6.6 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a $157 billion valuation and bolstering its efforts to build the world\u2019s leading generative AI technology.\nSoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son sketched out one of the most aggressive timelines for the adoption of artificial intelligence yet, envisioning a near future where the technology would run entire households.\nGlobal semiconductor makers are monitoring supplies of high-purity quartz, a material critical to the industry, after Hurricane Helene halted production at two North Carolina mines that produce most of the world\u2019s supply.\nUS prosecutors are broadening a probe of potential price-fixing by German software maker SAP SE and tech reseller Carahsoft Technology Corp., seeking to examine the companies\u2019 work with almost 100 government agencies, according to new court records that show the scope of the investigation is far greater than previously known.\nEarnings Due Thursday\nNo major earnings expected\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAdam Neumann\u2019s Latest Project Is a WeWork Competitor\nHow Bogg Bags, the Crocs of Totes, Won Over America\u2019s Moms\nElon Musk\u2019s Role in Reanimating the Far-Right Term \u2018Remigration\u2019\nThe Great \u20ac3 Billion Shipping Container Heist\nHow a Short Seller\u2019s Attack Threatens This Spanish Family Company\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

But it\u2019s been a tough sell of late.\nOver the past couple of years, a spike in interest rates, an energy crisis and the ascent of the so-called Magnificent Seven of technology behemoths have turned green investing into a losing bet. Impax\u2019s own share price is down almost 30% this year, while the S&P Global Clean Energy Index has lost more than 10%. The S&P 500, meanwhile, is up more than 20% in the same period.\nImpax recently reported results that showed gains in listed equities of \u00a35.3 billion ($6.9 billion) for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. That was less than the \u00a35.8 billion of net outflows that Impax saw in the period.\nA few years ago, Simm says there was a \u201cbig debate\u201d at Impax on the merits of piling into Nvidia. The case around artificial intelligence was \u201cspeculative at the time,\u201d he said. Back then, the asset manager concluded that Nvidia\u2019s technology was largely limited to the gaming industry and therefore the asset manager decided against going big on investing.\n\u201cFrankly, we\u2019ve underperformed for the last couple of years in our main strategies because we\u2019ve been more growth-at-a-reasonable-price, staying away from the momentum and hype around mega-cap tech investing,\u201d he said.\nAs Nvidia\u2019s share price was falling in June, Impax more than tripled its stake in the company to 4.9 million shares by the end of the month from 1.4 million shares at the end of the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and confirmed by Impax.\nSimm says Impax still considers Nvidia to be undervalued when taking into account how the boom in artificial intelligence is expected to drive demand for its chips.\nSimm says holding Nvidia, which like other technology giants needs to consume vast stores of energy to power its growth, also makes investing sense from a climate perspective. As demand for energy continues to increase, Nvidia and other companies that develop more efficient models will be better for the environment, he says.\nNvidia\u2019s Blackwell chips, which are beginning to roll out to customers this year, would need 3 gigawatts of power to develop OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 software, the company said at an event earlier this month. Ten years ago, that process would have required 5,500 gigawatts, the chipmaker said.\n\u201cNvidia\u2019s ability to deliver energy savings makes it even more valuable,\u201d Simm said.\nNvidia is emitting greenhouse gasses at a pace that exceeds levels needed to limit global warming to the critical threshold of 1.5C. Back in April, Morningstar analysts estimated the company\u2019s so-called implied temperature rise was 3.8C.\n\u201cYou can still make money from investing in society\u2019s response to too much CO2 emissions while still being bearish about what the net result\u2019s going to be,\u201d Simm said. Impax looks \u201cfor growth at a reasonable price rather than from an ethical perspective or the non-financial impact.\u201d\nExceeding the thresholds in the Paris climate agreement is \u201ca risk issue.\u201d\nBut \u201cpricing should sort that out, if countries are moving ahead with internalizing the cost of CO2 emissions,\u201d he said.\nImpax holds Nvidia in five strategies and funds. That includes its Global Opportunities portfolio, which is limited to 40 stocks and consists of companies that have a diversified business model, operate in high-growth markets and are \u201cout of favor for whatever reason,\u201d Simm said. Microsoft Corp. is included because Impax thinks it\u2019s undervalued \u201cin the context of the secular trend toward more AI,\u201d he said.\nIn fact, \u201cthe whole industrial space\u201d now looks undervalued, Simm said. That may change as a \u201csoft landing in the US\u201d looks increasingly likely, which is helping restore confidence, he said. The cost of capital is falling and consumer sentiment is stabilizing, so equity \u201cis looking more attractive.\u201d\n(Adds Nvidia implied temperature rise, CEO comments in final paragraphs.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nLina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes)\nWhy Is It So Hard for Clothing Resale Platforms to Make Money?\nMusk Reveals Why He\u2019s Jumping Into Trump\u2019s Arms\nChina Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space\nHow Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Why Nvidia and TSMC Stocks Just Popped, but Intel Dropped Today",
        "Author": "  Rich Smith, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Semiconductors star Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shot higher on Thursday morning, rising nearly 5% before retreating to about a 3% gain as of 11:11 a.m. ET. According to CNBC, there's no great mystery as to why. Citing comments made on the network's own Closing Bell: Overtime broadcast, CNBC quoted CEO Jensen Huang saying demand for Nvidia's new Blackwell chip for artificial intelligence (AI) functions is going \"insane.\"\nOh, and Blackwell is still on schedule to go on sale in Q4, just a few months away.\nThe good news is having a (good) knock-on effect on Nvidia's contract chips manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u00a0(NYSE: TSM), which is up 2%. However, it's having a less salutary effect on Nvidia rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). That stock is still down 0.9% after getting knocked for a 3.3% loss earlier in the day.\nCommenting on how Blackwell might boost Nvidia yesterday, investment bank J.P. Morgan predicted this new chip will add \"several billion\" dollars to Nvidia's sales in Q4, as TheFly.com reports. Those sales should also ramp as production rates build, bringing additional billions to Nvidia and TSMC as well.\nBut that's not the only catalyst at work today. Yesterday, OpenAI announced it had just raised $6.6 billion in new cash \"to accelerate progress\" on its AI software. OpenAI specifically stated that some of this money would go toward \"increas[ing] compute capacity\" (i.e., buying AI chips, most likely from Nvidia, and with TSMC doing the grunt work).\nOn top of the extra revenues these two companies can expect to receive from OpenAI's chip purchases, Nvidia will also benefit from the growing valuation of OpenAI itself, in which it is an investor. At last report, this latest funding round grew OpenAI's private market value to $157 billion.\nSo, what does this mean for Nvidia stock? Well, Nvidia next reports earnings on Nov. 19, and the outlook is good. Analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence forecast generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings to rise by better than 75% to $0.65 per share. Sales should be up 82% to $32.9 billion.\nWhat investors are really going to be looking at, though -- especially in light of these comments from J.P. Morgan and Huang himself -- is what kind of forecast Nvidia gives in its Q3 report for Q4. Right now, analysts think earnings growth will slow to only 43%, but if Blackwell sales cause growth to beat that number, things could be looking very bright indeed for Nvidia stock going forward.\nWhat's good news for Nvidia will likely be good news for Taiwan Semiconductor as well. And with TSMC stock selling for a much cheaper valuation than Nvidia (31 times trailing earnings versus 56 times), TSMC may be the smarter play on Nvidia's \"insane\" growth rate. It doesn't hurt, either, that TSMC manufactures chips for a whole lot of semiconductor companies not named Nvidia (Intel among them). So, if for some reason Blackwell is delayed or its growth doesn't pan out as planned, the effect on TSMC's revenues will be blunted.\nIn this respect, diversification can be a virtue.\nAll this being said, I see much less reason to feel optimistic about Intel. Priced at a steep 93 times earnings, it's the most expensive chips stock of the three and seems to be steadily losing ground to its archrival, Nvidia. Blackwell's on-time arrival in Q4 can only make things worse for Intel, I fear.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Should Not Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks.\nCompanies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to meet the growing demands of machine learning, data processing, and AI-driven applications. This spending is largely concentrated on building data centers, acquiring specialized hardware, and optimizing cloud infrastructure. According to a report by McKinsey, global AI infrastructure spending could reach up to $500 billion by 2027, highlighting the critical role it plays in the future of AI development. A large part of this investment is focused on AI-specific hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are crucial for training and deploying AI models. NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI chips, has seen demand for its GPUs soar, largely due to their centrality in deep learning tasks. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, has remarked that the AI boom is underpinned by massive infrastructure needs, and the market is just at the beginning of this growth curve.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nData centers are another focal point for AI infrastructure spending. AI workloads are highly demanding, requiring specialized facilities that can support high-density computing environments. Blackstone\u2019s $16 billion acquisition of AirTrunk, a leader in AI-driven data centers, underscores the increasing importance of such infrastructure. The deal will add 800 MW of data center capacity, with projections to grow beyond 1 GW, a testament to the rising demand for infrastructure to support AI-driven applications. Cloud infrastructure is also a major area where companies are pouring resources. Cloud giants are increasing their investments in AI infrastructure. These companies are developing new AI-optimized cloud services to cater to businesses adopting AI. Gartner predicts that by 2026, cloud AI infrastructure spending will surpass $200 billion, as enterprises increasingly shift from on-premise AI deployments to scalable cloud-based solutions.\nThomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, recently remarked that AI is unlocking entirely new revenue streams for enterprises, and cloud infrastructure is the backbone enabling this transformation. Beyond just hardware, organizations are also investing in data management platforms and storage solutions to handle the massive amounts of data AI systems require. In fact, estimates suggest that the global AI data infrastructure market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18%, driven by increased data volumes and the need for real-time data processing capabilities. Companies are significantly ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, focusing on hardware, data centers, and cloud computing. With projections showing continued growth in AI workloads, this spending will only increase in the coming years.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Latest reports, published by the news publication Bloomberg, reveal that regulators in China are discouraging businesses from purchasing NVIDIA chips. NVIDIA is not allowed to sell advanced chips to Chinese entities, under orders from the US government, but some models are allowed for export, like the H20. NVIDIA derives almost 12% of revenue from the sales of low-end chips and software to companies in China.\nThe Chinese pushback against NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is largely viewed as an effort to decrease reliance on American chips and encourage purchase from domestic chipmakers, chief among them being Cambricon and Huawei. The US has discouraged NVIDIA from exporting chips to China for two years.\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Is the Deal Between Nvidia and Accenture a Game-Changer?",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the biggest trends since early 2023 has been the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The advancements in that arena are viewed by many as the most important technological developments in decades, and the paradigm shift they are driving has sparked an AI gold rush as businesses scramble to adapt.\nWhile it's still evolving, generative AI holds a great deal of promise. These systems can create original content -- including images, text, and video -- but can also take specific sets of data and summarize it, or use it to create presentations, or automate mundane and time-consuming tasks, increasing worker productivity. And new applications for the technology are still being developed rapidly.\nNow, AI chip specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and global tech consultancy Accenture (NYSE: ACN) are joining forces to help more businesses join the AI revolution.\nIn a press release that dropped last week, Nvidia and Accenture announced that they were expanding their existing partnership, aiming \"to help the world's enterprises rapidly scale their AI adoption.\" The companies marked the occasion with the launch of the new Accenture Nvidia Business Group, which will be staffed by 30,000 subject matter experts who are getting a crash course in the intricacies of AI. These professionals will be tasked with helping \"clients reinvent processes and scale enterprise AI adoption with AI agents,\" said Accenture in its press release.\nTo facilitate these objectives, the companies have launched the Accenture AI Refinery, a platform outfitted with Nvidia's AI Foundry, AI Enterprise, and Omniverse systems. The platform will help users build custom large language models (LLMs), the systems that underpin generative AI. These LLMs will incorporate \"domain-specific knowledge,\" which will result in powerful AI systems designed to help address business-specific needs. The Accenture AI Refinery \"will be available on all public and private cloud platforms,\" with the ultimate goal of deploying business-centric \"agentic\" AI agents.\nAccording to Accenture, agentic AI represents the next evolution of AI systems, giving them a new degree of autonomy. Rather than responding to prompts like their predecessors, agentic AI models will act with minimal oversight, seeking to understand the intent of their users and acting accordingly. As a result, these systems will be able to make decisions and act autonomously to achieve assigned tasks by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable steps.\nOne of the key benefits of the Accenture/Nvidia pairing is that it will remove one of the last major roadblocks to AI adoption by enterprises -- namely, potential clients' lack of the in-house knowledge necessary to implement such complex systems. By leaning on Accenture's experts and using Nvidia's state-of-the-art platforms, companies will be able to develop AI systems that address their specific needs.\nBoth Nvidia and Accenture are working to extend their advantages as businesses scramble to adopt AI.\nIn its fiscal 2024 (which ended Aug. 31), Accenture reported several AI-specific developments. Despite revenue that grew just 1% to $64.9 billion, it generated record bookings of $81.2 billion, an increase of 13%. When bookings increase at a faster rate than revenue, this usually signals that growth is accelerating.\nIndeed, the company delivered $3 billion in AI-related bookings for the year, with $1 billion in the fourth quarter alone. One of the more notable developments has been Accenture's embrace of AI. Its staff attended 44 million hours of training in fiscal 2024, a number that was up by 10% \"predominantly due to [generative AI] training.\" (Notably, the company's workforce now exceeds 700,000.)\nNvidia's AI journey has been well documented: It has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI revolution thanks to its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs), which are well suited to provide the computational horsepower needed to train and run AI software. In Nvidia's fiscal 2024 (which ended Jan. 28), revenue soared 126% to $60.9 billion, while earnings per share surged 586% to $11.93. Its rapid growth continued into the first six months of its fiscal 2025, as revenue climbed 171% year over year to $56 billion, and earnings per share jumped 284% to $1.27.\nManagement's guidance for the current quarter is for revenue growth of 79%. While that's a far cry from the triple-digit percentage growth it has generated for the past five consecutive quarters, it's still enviable by any measure.\nThe most obvious benefit of a deal like the one Nvidia and Accenture just announced is its potential to keep the AI flywheel spinning.\nAccenture gets access to Nvidia's cutting-edge technology, and it can use its expertise to help customers implement AI solutions. For its part, Nvidia is enlisting what is arguably the world's largest network of IT consultants to train customers to use Nvidia's AI solutions. Accenture boasts a data and AI-centric workforce of roughly 57,000, and its goal is to increase that to 80,000 by the end of its fiscal 2026.\nGiven their growth prospects and the potential opportunity represented by AI, both stocks offer compelling opportunities, although each will likely appeal to a different group of investors.\nAccenture is attractively priced at 28 times forward earnings. It's the more conservative choice. Nvidia is not nearly as cheap, but attractive nonetheless. Based on earnings expectations for the fiscal year that will begin in January, the stock trades at a forward multiple of 33, a premium to the S&P 500's trailing earnings multiple of 30. However, that's a reasonable price to pay for a company that's expected to grow its earnings at an annualized rate of more than 50% over the next five years.\nThis deal benefits both partners by accelerating the adoption of AI among Accenture's customers, using Nvidia's technology to get there. While it might not quite qualify as a \"game-changer,\" it certainly increases the prospects for both companies, giving them additional advantages as the AI revolution plays out.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in 2024, with stunning gains of 145% as of this writing, but the semiconductor giant's performance has been patchy over the past three months despite its impressive quarterly results.\nMore specifically, Nvidia stock has lost 2% of its value in this time frame. That may be attributed to various reasons, such as the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to keep driving elevated levels of growth for the company, the viability of AI to justify the huge amounts of money that corporations and governments are pouring into this technology, and the rich valuation that Nvidia commands.\nNow, a closer look at Nvidia's prospects suggests that those concerns may not hold much water in the long run. The company's focus on diversifying its business, as well as the sustained spending on AI infrastructure and software, are likely to help it keep growing at a healthy pace. However, investors who are looking for a cheaper AI alternative may want to look at options beyond Nvidia to invest their money.\nThis is where Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ: CHKP) comes in. The Israeli cybersecurity specialist has jumped 17% in the past three months, outshining Nvidia's returns by a big margin. Let's see why that has been the case and check if this company has the potential to sustain its impressive rally.\nCheck Point Software may not be as well known as other cybersecurity providers such as Palo Alto Networks or CrowdStrike because of its slow pace of growth, but a closer look at the company's recent financial performance tells us that it is moving in the right direction.\nThe company released its second-quarter results back in July, reporting a 7% year-over-year increase in revenue to $627 million. Its adjusted earnings increased by 8% from the same period last year to $2.17 per share. The numbers exceeded the midpoint of the company's revenue forecast of $622 million and earnings per share estimate of $2.15 per share.\nCheck Point attributed its stronger-than-expected performance to the healthy growth of its security subscription business, which is being driven by the growing adoption of its AI-powered Infinity security platform that recorded double-digit revenue growth in the previous quarter. Check Point management pointed out on the company's July earnings conference call that the increased bookings from the Infinity platform are driving an improvement in its billings.\nThe company says that it struck \"nice eight-figure deals in Infinity,\" a momentum that's likely to continue thanks to the growing usage of AI within the cybersecurity space. The company is offering multiple AI-focused tools such as a generative AI assistant known as Infinity AI Copilot that is aimed at helping reduce the time taken to perform administrative tasks and improve the effectiveness of cybersecurity analysts.\nIt also offers another product known as Infinity ThreatCloud AI, using which organizations can completely automate their firewalls using real-time data. More importantly, Check Point says that it plans to come up with a new AI-focused offering every quarter. That's a smart thing to do as the market for generative AI-based cybersecurity products is expected to generate $40 billion in revenue by 2030 as compared to an estimated $7 billion this year.\nSo Check Point's focus on generative AI-based cybersecurity could eventually help improve its growth rate in the future. It is worth noting that the company's security subscriptions business recorded 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the previous quarter to $272 million, accounting for 43% of its top line. That was an improvement over the prior-year period, when subscriptions accounted for 40% of its top line.\nThe faster growth of the subscription business and the potential room for growth here suggest that Check Point could be poised for stronger growth going forward. Not surprisingly, the company is expected to deliver double-digit earnings growth over the next couple of years, following this year's estimated jump of 8% (it delivered $8.42 per share in earnings in 2023).\nCheck Point is trading at 27 times trailing earnings. Its forward earnings multiple of 19 points toward a significant improvement in the company's bottom line. The stock is currently cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple of 31 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks), which means that investors are getting a good deal on the stock right now.\nWhat's more, the company has a solid balance sheet with just $36 million in debt and a cash position of $1.66 billion. Assuming Check Point's bottom line does increase to $11.12 per share in 2026, as per the chart, and it trades at 31 times earnings at that time (in line with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple), its stock price could jump to $345. That would be a 78% increase from current levels.\nSo investors looking for an attractively valued tech stock that could capitalize on the growing adoption of AI and deliver healthy gains in the long run can consider buying Check Point as it looks all set to jump higher.\nBefore you buy stock in Check Point Software Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Check Point Software Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

Shares of Nvidia have been on a tear, rising 149% year-to-date, making it the second-best-performing S&P 500 stock this year.\n\"Demand for Blackwell is insane,\" Huang said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday after the market close.\nHuang addressed the state of production for the Blackwell chip, as reports of small redesigns to the chip earlier this year led to slight delays in its rollout to customers.\n\"Blackwell is in full production, Blackwell is as planned,\" Huang said. \"Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first.\"\nThose comments align with the comments of some of Nvidia's biggest customers, including Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison.\nEarlier this month, Ellison said he and Elon Musk \"begged\" for more GPU chips during a dinner with Huang.\nEllison said they told Huang, \"Please take our money. We need you to take more of our money.\"\nIn the CNBC interview on Wednesday, Huang also reiterated that the company is on track to deliver a faster and more efficient GPU chip to customers every year.\n\"If we can increase the performance as we've done with Hopper to Blackwell by two to three times each year, we're effectively increasing the revenues or the throughput of our customers on these infrastructures by a couple times each year, or you could think about it as decreasing costs every two or three years,\" Huang said.\nHe added: \"We're on a path to do that and everything's on track.\"\nHuang emphasized in the interview that Nvidia has its fingerprints all over various layers of the computing stack, from GPU chips to software to networking components.\n\"This is a brand new way of doing computing, and we're dedicated to build the entire stack and reinvent every layer of the technology stack so that... every company in the world can benefit from this revolutionary new technology we call AI,\" Huang said.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Text": "US stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors reacted to downbeat earnings from ASML Holding (ASML) that dropped a day earlier than expected, sending chipmaker stocks lower across the board.\nShares of the leading semiconductor supplier sank more than 15% after its earnings, released in an apparent error, showed a disappointing sales outlook for 2025. Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell in tandem, dropping around 5% to slip back from their freshly minted high. AMD (AMD) stock also dipped 5%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged down about 0.8%, or more than 300 points, on the heels of closing above 43,000 for the first time. The blue-chip index was dragged down by UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which saw shares fall around 8% after its 2025 profit guidance missed estimates.\nMeanwhile, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) also dropped roughly 0.8% to fall from Monday's all-time high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank around 1%.\nInvestors also assessed a fresh crop of bank earnings before the bell with Goldman Sachs (GS) reporting a 45% surge in third quarter profit from a year ago, thanks to a rise in dealmaking. Similarly, Bank of America's (BAC) posted an earnings beat amid its own outperformance in investment banking.\nAs the rush of earnings starts to broaden out, hopes are for further positive surprises in what some on Wall Street suspect could be a tricky season. Shares in Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) finished the day up around 15% higher on the heels of its plan to shut 1,200 stores over three years, as the pharmacy chain pursues a turnaround.\nOutside of earnings, energy was another major focus. Oil prices tumbled roughly 4% on a report that Israel is prepared to refrain from bombarding Iran's crude and nuclear facilities in its response to an attack two weeks ago. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CL=F) sank to just under $71 a barrel, while Brent crude futures (BZ=F) fell to around $74.50 following the Washington Post report.\nUnited Airlines (UAL) reported third quarter financials on Tuesday that beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending the stock about 1% higher in after-hours trading.\nAdjusted earnings hit $3.33 per share in the quarter, while revenue rose 2.5% year over year to $14.84 billion.\nThe airliner also announced its first stock buyback since before the pandemic. It plans to purchase $1.5 billion worth of shares.\n\"I appreciate the entire United team coming together to take care of our customers by operating a safe and on-time airline this summer,\" United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said in the earnings release.\n\"As predicted, unproductive capacity left the market in mid-August, and we saw a clear inflection point in our revenue trends that propelled United to exceed Q3 expectations,\" he added. \"A prosperous summer 2024 is just the beginning as our improved customer experience combined with United Next positions the airline at the top of the industry for the foreseeable future.\"\nUS stocks closed in a sea of red on Tuesday, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which was dragged down by chipmakers including Nvidia (NVDA) and ASML Holding (ASML).\nThe Nasdaq Composite sank around 1%, while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) each dropped roughly 0.8% to fall from their previous all-time highs.\nOn Tuesday, in speech titled \"Landing Softly Is Just the Beginning,\" San Francisco Federal Reserve president Mary Daly called on a chart that showed the post-pandemic economic expansion could have room to run further.\nAt this point, the current economic expansion has been underway for 54 months, well short of the expansions that were seen starting in 1982, 1991, 2001, and 2009.\nWhile speaking at New York University on Tuesday, Daly noted that the Fed's work to achieve a \"soft landing\" isn't fully done, but the trajectory of the economy after inflation falls to 2% will remain just as important.\n\"We must strive for a world where people aren't worried about inflation or the economy,\" Daly said.\nDaly added, \"No matter which expansion you look at ... the message is the same. Sustained expansion helps all Americans.\"\nThis speaks to the growing conversation following the hot September jobs report about whether or not further economic expansion could impact the Fed's fight against inflation. \nDaly told Yahoo Finance that a pickup in labor market data isn't necessarily inflationary in and of itself.\n\"That's a fear more than a fact,\" Daly said.\nFor now, her check-ins with firms reveal that consumers are less willing to pay higher prices and customers are continuing to trade down and look for value. This would point to an economy that's still seeing consumers spending, but not necessarily one that's fueling a resurgence in inflation.\n\"This is not an environment where firms are looking to raise prices,\" Daly said. \"They're looking to grow, but they're not looking to raise prices.\"\nTrading in Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) was briefly halted on Tuesday due to volatility.\nShares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, suddenly plunged around 5% in late afternoon trading after extending previous gains by more than 13% earlier in the session.\nIt is unclear what exactly caused the abrupt drop in share price, although it was an incredibly high-volume trading session.\nThe former president spoke with Bloomberg News at the Economic Club of Chicago earlier in the day. He argued for more US tariffs, calling \"tariff the \"most beautiful word in the dictionary.\"\nIt's a big earnings week for markets, with United Airlines (UAL), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Netflix (NFLX) still left to report quarterly results.\nNetflix, set to report after the market close on Thursday, will have a high bar to overcome as the stock trades near record highs and analysts predict another price hike across its various streaming tiers.\nNetflix is expected to report earnings of $5.16 per share on revenue of $9.78 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. This would represent nearly 40% earnings growth compared to the prior year.\nInvestors have praised the company's foray into sports and live events. Meanwhile, its ad tier continues to gain traction. Shares have soared as a result, with the stock up about 45% since the start of the year.\nLast week, the stock secured another all-time closing high of around $730 a share. It's since retreated to trade closer to $710 a share. But the recent run-up has led to some apprehension on Wall Street.\n\"We expect Netflix\u2019s stock to trade higher on a US price hike announcement,\" Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a note to clients. \"But we would expect shares to eventually trade lower as investor\u2019s hopes for $25 in 2025 EPS are dashed.\"\nFor the full year, Netflix's earnings are projected to rise about 60% year over year to $19.10 per share, while full-year revenue of $38.75 billion would mark an increase of about 15% on a yearly basis.\nIn 2025, analysts anticipate full-year earnings to rise to $23 with revenue jumping to $43.46 billion.\nWall Street strategists keep growing more bullish on the stock market rally.\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, UBS Investment Bank equity strategist Jonathan Golub boosted his year-end target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2024 and 2025. Golub now sees the benchmark index ending this year at 5,850, from a prior target of 5,600. In 2025, Golub projects the S&P 500 will end the year at 6,400, up from a prior target of 6,000.\nGolub notes the economic backdrop is \"supportive,\" with growth data proving resilient, the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, and recession risk falling by the wayside. He sees further upside for the benchmark index as inflation falls, providing room for further easing from the Fed.\nGolub added that given the positive backdrop, in an upside scenario, small-business activity should \"improve\" this, leading to \"broad-based profit strength, loan performance and credit spreads driving valuations higher.\"\nApple (AAPL) stock hit a new intraday high of $237.49 on Tuesday, eclipsing its prior record of $237.23 on July 15. The stock's climb added about $70 billion to its market capitalization, putting it further ahead of Nvidia (NVDA) as the world's most valuable company after Nvidia's gains jeopardized the iPhone maker's lead.\nThe stock pared gains after notching the record, gaining about 1.5% in afternoon trading. Meanwhile, Nvidia fell around 4%.\nApple's upward move comes a day after preliminary data showed rising demand for iPhones in the third quarter. Global iPhone shipments rose 3.5% from last year, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC).\n\"While the growth of the Chinese players in emerging markets has been an ongoing theme this year, Apple also enjoyed a 3.5% YoY growth in shipments this quarter fueled by strong demand from the previous models and the launch of the new iPhone 16 lineup,\" said Nabila Popal, IDC's data & analytics senior director, in a statement Monday.\n\"Despite the staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence in markets outside the U.S., Apple will continue to grow in the upcoming holiday season,\" she added.\nApple released its new iPad mini, which is equipped to run its suite of AI features, on Tuesday.\nApple is set to report earnings Oct. 31, and Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg expect earnings to rise 9% from last year to $1.59 per share. Some 40 analysts recommend buying the stock, while 19 have a Hold rating and two recommend selling shares, according to Bloomberg data. Apple shares are up 32% from last year, and analysts see the stock rising further to over $245 over the next 12 months, Bloomberg data shows.\nNvidia (NVDA) shares sank more than 5% Tuesday, partially reversing its two week-rally and coming down from a record close the day before.\nThe stock's tumble comes after a Bloomberg report that Biden administration officials are considering capping US chip exports to certain countries. Citing unnamed sources, Bloomberg reported that potential regulations would focus on Persian Gulf countries in the interest of national security. The stocks of fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC) also fell, responding to the Bloomberg report and a dismal earnings report from semiconductor supplier ASML (ASML).\nNvidia stock has been more volatile since its 10-for-1 stock split in June, and news of heightened trade tensions focused on the AI chip sector \u2014 which Nvidia leads \u2014 have pushed shares down various times over the past two years. For example, Nvidia shares experienced a similar decline this time last year \u2014 when the Biden administration tightened export controls on US chips \u2014 before extending its historic rally.\nNvidia shares are up around 191% from last year.\nA surprise earnings report from ASML Holding (ASML) sent stocks lower across the board on Tuesday.\nShares of the leading semiconductor supplier sank around 15% after its earnings, released in an apparent error, showed a disappointing sales outlook for 2025. Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell in tandem, dropping around 4% to slip back from their freshly minted high. AMD (AMD) stock dropped 4%.\nThe moves erased prior gains of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which fell around 0.8%. As a result, the tech sector was one of the biggest laggards of the day, down nearly 2%.\nOil tumbled as much as 5% on Tuesday as supply fears faded after a media report signaled Israel would avoid targeting Iran\u2019s petroleum production. A glut of supply forecasted by the International Energy Agency also weighed on prices.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) dropped to hover near $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, fell below $74.\nPrices declined after a Washington Post article stated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Biden Administration Tel Aviv would avoid targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear and oil facilities when it retaliates for the ballistic missile attack earlier this month.\n\"Overall right now, its a bit of a bearish outlook for oil given china's economy and given Middle East tensions aren't escalating at this moment,\" GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis Patrick De Haan told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday morning.\nBoeing stock edged up close to 0.4% after filing paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday to issue shares of debt securities and common stock worth up to $25 billion over the next three years in a bid to generate much-needed cash.\nSeparately, the aircraft manufacturer said Tuesday that it has entered a $10 billion credit agreement.\nBoeing has had a chaotic year, beginning with a Jan. 5 incident in which an airplane part called a door plug blew off of one of its 737 Maxes \u2014 and set off a series of regulatory probes that revealed underlying safety issues at the company and led to the resignation of its CEO. Then, last month, 33,000 Boeing workers walked off the job, seeking access to pension plans, job security, safety improvements, and higher wages. The strike, which crossed the one-month mark on Sunday, has cost the company and workers an estimated $5 billion, according to a report by Anderson Economic Group reviewed by CNN.\nBoeing shares are down 42.6% from the start of the year.\nThe company is at risk of an S&P credit downgrade to junk, Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferr\u00e9 reports. Shares most recently slid last Friday after Boeing said it would cut its workforce by 10% and delay its first delivery of its 777X jet to 2026, Ferr\u00e9 wrote.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) index traded near its all-time high early Tuesday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose roughly 0.2%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dipped about 0.6% on the heels of closing above 43,000 for the first time as markets assessed a fresh wave of earnings.\nWhat's largely responsible for the drag on the Dow? UnitedHealth Group (UNH). The company saw shares fall nearly 10% after its 2025 profit guidance missed estimates.\nA fresh batch of bank earnings rolled in Tuesday morning, with strong quarterly results from Goldman Sachs (GS), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), PNC (PNC), and State Street (STT) lifting the market.\nHere are some of the highlights:\nHealthcare stocks moved in different directions following mixed results. Here's a look:\nNot to be outdone by Big Lots and True Value recently announcing they were going bankrupt, Walgreens (WBA) is back in focus today with its now-normal dose of bad news.\nThe drugstore chain said this morning it will close 1,200 stores over the next three years. That's a huge number, one that says a lot about the company's struggles over the last two years.\nThese numbers from Yahoo Finance shed further light on Walgreens' problems:\nAnother big morning for the banks on the investment banking front.\nGoldman Sachs (GS) delivered a 20% increase in its investment banking fees in the third quarter. Bank of America (BAC) also notched a 20% increase. Citi's (C) investment banking revenue grew 31%.\nLast week, JPMorgan (JPM) showed a 31% year-over-year increase.\nIs there a year-end advisory boom ahead of the November election as CEOs plot out their next five years? Could be. But there could also be a lot of companies preparing to IPO in 2025 amid near-record markets and the prospect of lower interest rates.\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the\u00a010 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other Most Promising Growth Stock According to Hedge Funds.\nInvestors had been anxiously anticipating the start of a bull market, which the S&P 500 confirmed earlier this year. The bull run has seen the market continue to rise to new record highs, supporting revenue and earnings growth across the board.\nFast forward, the upward momentum appears to have peaked, with market indices at record highs. While it was highly expected that stocks would explode on the Federal Reserve offering support to a struggling economy with interest rate cuts, that has not been the case.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy\u00a0and\u00a07 Best Nanotech Penny Stocks to Buy.\nIt\u2019s become increasingly clear that investors have become more sensitive to growth scares as the global economy faces many issues. Top on the list is the rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that threaten to disrupt supply chain networks. Energy prices rising owing to the escalation of a full-blown war could trigger higher inflation, something that is unsettling the markets.\nAnalysts at UBS are already warning investors that they should get overweight on defensive names as global growth slows at the back of deteriorating fundamentals. While UBS doesn\u2019t anticipate a severe downturn, the bank is cautious, advising its clients to focus on important sectors like utilities and pharmaceuticals, which always outperform in a downturn.\nWhile investors are increasingly rotating into defensive plays amid concerns about geopolitical tensions and the slowing global economy, Morgan Stanley Investment Management\u2019s Andrew Slimmon recommends against this strategy.\n\u201cNow is the time to just be cautious. Don\u2019t chase the defensives that are working because I think when we get to the fourth quarter, that won\u2019t work,\u201d the portfolio manager told CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Exchange.\n\u201cWhile our expectation is for October to remain choppy, we don\u2019t view the overall market action to be bearish and encourage investors to maintain perspective on the longer-term trends,\u201d Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, wrote to clients.\nThe sentiments echo the need to focus on high-growth companies. Investors who diversify their portfolio into high-growth companies eventually earn great returns regardless of how much a stock rises or falls in the short term.\nAnalysts project that S&P 500 stocks will grow at a median annual EPS rate of 8.5% over the next five years. On the other hand, the best growth stocks are well poised to outperform this benchmark by a factor of two to three or more.\nFor starters, companies exposed to artificial intelligence spectacles or those leveraging technology continue to deliver record earnings and revenue growth, thus dominating most hedge fund portfolios. Additionally, the most promising growth stocks, according to hedge funds, are those whose core business would be positively impacted by improving consumer purchasing power. As the Fed steers the economy into a soft landing, consumer purchasing is expected to improve, benefiting consumer cyclical stocks. Moreover, the rate cuts will likely benefit growth and tech stocks as well.\nMarket fluctuations are inevitable, but the secret to a growth stock\u2019s success lies in the robustness of its core operations. Regardless of whether a stock is rising or falling in the short term, if you consistently invest in a competitively solid business, you\u2019ll eventually reap substantial rewards.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to find 30 popular growth stocks. Then we selected the 10 that were the most widely held by hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nWhen it comes to artificial intelligence, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stays ahead of the pack owing to the strong demand for its graphic processing units used to power various AI models. The artificial intelligence frenzy has powered the company to become the most valuable company in the world on the back of record-breaking revenues and earnings.\nRevenue in the second quarter was up 122% to $30 billion as net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion. The company expects Q3 revenue to increase 80% to $32.5 billion. Given the rate at which the company\u2019s earnings and revenues are growing while the artificial intelligence frenzy is all but starting, underlines why it is one of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds.\nWhile NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has gained significantly over the past year, causing the stock to trade at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 34, there is still room for more gains. The stock could hit another all-time high due to the \u2018insane\u2019 demand for the company\u2019s new Blackwell chip.\nCEO Jensen Huang said \u201cIt [Blackwell] gives us an opportunity to triple down, to really drive the innovation cycle so that we can increase capabilities, increase our throughput, decrease our costs, and decrease our energy consumption.\u201d\nGiven that the company has delivered five straight quarters of triple-digit percentage revenue growth, the trend is not expected to change. The Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 50 basis points and hinting at further cuts should make it easy for companies investing in AI, fueling additional demand for Nvidia chips.\nThe market experienced a strong tailwind for AI chips, and the expansion of data centers translates to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s booming business. The company\u2019s own guidance calls for 79% in revenue growth in the current quarter, affirming the tremendous opportunities in the market.\nWith NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s board approving an additional $50 billion in share buybacks last summer, there\u2019s a strong belief that the stock is worth considering. It is one of the stocks rated as a buy with an average price target of $152.44, implying a 14.60% upside potential.\nBased on our Insider Monkey database, by the end of Q2 2024, 179 investors held a positive outlook on NVDA, collectively holding stakes worth $53.7 billion.\nIthaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefited from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d\nOverall NVDA\u00a0ranks 6th\u00a0on our list of 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock Has Soared Over 20% in 5 Weeks. Here's Why Wall Street Thinks It's Still a Buy.",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Standing at the center of the revolution. That's where Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) finds itself. The revolution, in this case, is being fueled by the rapid developments in artificial intelligence (AI).\nNvidia has delivered such massive gains in recent years that it's easy to overlook how the stock has performed over the short term. Most investors would be happy with a 20% gain in a year. Nvidia's share price has soared over 20% in the last five weeks.\nAnd analysts don't think the momentum will evaporate. Here's why Wall Street thinks Nvidia stock is still a buy.\nWe can explain Nvidia's recent impressive gains in one nine-letter word: Blackwell. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview with CNBC earlier this month the demand for his company's new Blackwell AI chip is \"insane.\" He explained, \"Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first.\"\nThe market response to Blackwell isn't surprising. When Nvidia first introduced the new GPU architecture in a March 2024 press release, the headline stated that the Blackwell platform would \"power a new era of computing.\" That wasn't just spin from the company's marketing team.\nBlackwell can run large language models (LLMs) with 1 trillion parameters at up to 25 times less cost and energy consumption than Nvidia's industry-leading Hopper platform. Customers including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI were among the first to announce plans to use the new architecture.\nNvidia's gains over the last few weeks were even higher. However, the stock pulled back after Bloomberg reported that the U.S. could impose caps on exports of advanced AI chips to some countries in the Middle East.\nThe average 12-month price target for Nvidia reflects an upside potential of nearly 14%, according to LSEG. One analyst thinks the stock could soar another 55% over the next 12 months.\nGranted, Wall Street's enthusiasm about Nvidia has declined somewhat as its share price has increased. In September, 55 of the 60 analysts surveyed by LSEG rated Nvidia as a \"buy\" or \"strong buy.\" So far in October, LSEG has surveyed 38 analysts. Twenty-two recommended the stock as a \"buy\" or \"strong buy.\"\nWhy do so many analysts still expect Nvidia's momentum to continue? The positive sentiment is largely due to Nvidia's continued dominance in the AI chip market. Although Nvidia has rivals, its GPUs remain the gold standard in training and running AI models.\nMorgan Stanley likes that Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs are sold out for the next 12 months. Analyst Joseph Moore said, \"[E]very indication from management is that we are still early in a long term AI investment cycle.\" The investment firm named Nvidia as a \"Top Pick.\"\nWe'll have to wait and see if Wall Street's target of another 14% gain by Nvidia will materialize over the next 12 months. However, I suspect this price target is overly cautious.\nNvidia hasn't reported sales for its Blackwell chips yet. As the numbers begin to come in and keep growing, don't be surprised if multiple analysts issue upward revisions to their price targets for the stock.\nThe AI revolution is only in its early stages, as Morgan Stanley's Moore stated. And Nvidia will almost certainly remain at the center of this revolution for a long time to come.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "These 4 Measures Indicate That NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Is Using Debt Safely",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n See our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$8.46b of debt in July 2024, down from US$9.71b, one year before. But on the other hand it also has US$34.8b in cash, leading to a US$26.3b net cash position.\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$14.0b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$13.1b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$34.8b and US$14.1b worth of receivables due within a year. So it actually has US$21.9b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nHaving regard to NVIDIA's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$3.25t company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\nBetter yet, NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 459% last year, which is an impressive improvement. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, NVIDIA produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 79% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that NVIDIA has net cash of US$26.3b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And we liked the look of last year's 459% year-on-year EBIT growth. So we don't think NVIDIA's use of debt is risky. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with NVIDIA (including 1 which can't be ignored) .\nOf course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Why Nvidia, Micron, Broadcom, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Semiconductor Stocks Slumped on Tuesday",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena ",
        "Text": "Some of the biggest drivers of the ongoing market rally that began early last year are the advances in artificial intelligence (AI). These next-generation algorithms and the semiconductors that power them could spark a wave of increased productivity.\nThe potential to profit from these advances has fueled rapid adoption of AI, which has sent purchases of semiconductors soaring. However, the chip industry could be among the first to feel the impact of the just-announced dockworkers' strike.\nWith that as a backdrop, AI chip specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) slumped 3.9%, memory and storage chipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) tumbled 3.9%, semiconductor specialist Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) fell 3.1%, and database and AI chipmaker Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) dropped 1.9%, as of 2:06 p.m. ET on Tuesday.\nA check of all the usual suspects \u2014 financial reports, regulatory filings, and changes to analysts' price targets \u2014 showed nothing in the way of any company-specific news to explain the falling stock prices. This suggests investors were focused on the work stoppage at some of the biggest ports in the U.S. and what that means for the semiconductor industry and the market rally in general.\nOn Tuesday, the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) began its first widespread strike in almost 50 years. The union said that tens of thousands of its members have begun to hit picket lines at ports along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts beginning at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.\nThe ports on those two coasts are the destination for more than half the containerized products imported into the country. If the strike extends for more than a few days, there could be a ripple effect on the supply chain and, by extension, the broader economy.\nDelays of everyday products could reignite inflation, cause shortages, and drive up prices. The longer the strike lasts, the more likely the chance of economic upheaval.\nGov. Kathy Hochul of New York said that \"the food supply is secure right now,\" urging consumers not to stockpile items unnecessarily. While a shortage of essential goods like food and household items is still weeks away, other industries could be affected, including semiconductors.\nThe accelerating adoption of AI has already caused many of the most advanced chips to be in short supply. As a result, a shortage of semiconductors resulting from the dockworkers' strike could come sooner rather than later.\nSo, what's the potential impact on our quartet of companies? In the near term, a disruption in the semiconductor pipeline could slow revenue and profit growth. Over the long term, however, any impact would be fleeting at most.\nMany AI and semiconductor stocks have been bid up since early last year as investors feared missing out on the next big trend. If a shortage of chips comes to pass due to this strike, it will likely be short-lived, and the pent-up demand will remain once the strike has passed.\nInvestors should stay focused on the long-term opportunity of AI, which will play out over years, not weeks or months. It takes the most advanced semiconductors to power this technology, so the future remains bright for these pillars of the chip industry.\nNvidia created the graphics processing units (GPUs) that provide the computational horsepower used in AI systems.\nBroadcom creates many of the semiconductors and ancillary technology used in data centers and cloud computing, where much of AI occurs.\nOracle is primarily known for its database and cloud infrastructure services, but it also designs and engineers chips used for AI.\nMicron Technology makes flash memory and storage processors, which are crucial components in the GPUs that are used for AI processing.\nSome of these stocks might appear pricey at first glance, but any premium is well deserved. Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle, and Micron are currently selling for 41 times, 35 times, 27 times, and 11 times forward earnings, respectively. However, given the accelerating adoption of AI and the corresponding accelerating growth of these companies (all of which provide components that are crucial to the AI revolution), I would rate them all buys.\nThat said, each of these stocks carries increased volatility, and the potential for supply chain disruption could further exacerbate that situation. Investors should hold on for a wild ride.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Johnny Rice, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is set to host its 2024 AI Summit starting Oct. 7. The event will bring together leaders from across the industry to see and hear from some of the foremost minds in AI. It's a chance to catch a peek at the future of this potentially revolutionary technology.\nWith such a big event upcoming, you might be asking yourself: Should I invest in Nvidia now? History may give us a clue. Let's take a closer look at the company.\nThere was a time when Nvidia and its longtime rival, Advanced Micro Devices, were neck and neck in their battle to control the gaming market. By and large, there was parity between both of the company's income statements. That's changed. After AI hit an inflection point in late 2022, Nvidia is dominating AMD, earning more in profits than AMD does in total revenue. Take a look at this chart, which shows just how monumental the recent shift has been.\nThat's what you get when you control 90% of a market as valuable as AI silicon. The great news for Nvidia is that it doesn't look like the gravy train will stop anytime soon. The messaging from the rest of big tech, the companies that represent most of its business, is that their spending is likely to accelerate in the near future.\nThis is a race of sorts, and none of the big players can afford to be left behind. As Alphabet's CEO, Sundar Pichai, put it in the company's latest earnings call: \"The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here.\" Alphabet expects to spend roughly $50 billion this year in capital expenditures (capex), up from $32 billion the year before -- and it's not alone.\nAt present, the bulk of this spending is still flowing through Nvidia as AMD, Intel, and others struggle to match the power and efficiency of Nvidia's chips. There is still enormous demand for its current generation, and the company's next generation will likely ship within the next few months. The massive profits Nvidia has enjoyed means it has large amounts to spend on maintaining its edge. Despite already leading the pack, Nvidia outspent AMD in research and development roughly two to one last quarter.\nThis will be the third year in a row that Nvidia will host an AI event in this vein. The company began these events in 2022 with a virtual event focused on speech in AI. 2023 was supposed to be the first year of a full-fledged, multi-day AI summit, but the event was moved online for a single day. This year's event will take place in person over three days.\nDespite their more modest meeting formats, both of the previous iterations led to a nice bump-up in Nvidia's stock price. In the week that followed 2022's event, shares were up as much as 10%. In 2023, they were up as much as 6.5%. So will this year's conference also lead to a jump in stock price? Maybe.\nI know that might be a disappointing answer, but the truth is that we can't know for sure. First of all, two years is a very small sample size from which to draw firm conclusions. Also, even if we had more years to reference, correlation is not causation. Just because two things can be linked -- like an AI summit and a jump in stock price -- doesn't mean one happens because of the other.\nBut the event is a chance to remember the power that AI holds. Instead of thinking about possible short-term stock movements, focus on the company's long-term prospects. Don't lose sight of the forest for the trees. This is a company at the top of its game, enabling the adoption of a potentially revolutionary technology.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

On Saturday, Foxconn posted its highest-ever revenue for the third quarter on strong demand for AI servers.\nFoxconn's other focus is ambitious plans to diversify away from its role of building consumer electronics for Apple, hoping to use its tech know-how to offer electric vehicle contract manufacturing and also produce vehicles using models built by the Foxtron brand.\nAsked about fierce competition in the global electric vehicle market amid slowing demand, Liu said Foxconn was committed to the sector.\n\"It is the right direction and we will continue to work hard towards that,\" he said, adding that with the EVs, the \"engine barrier\" no longer exists in car manufacturing.\nAutomakers \"don't need to make the whole car themselves anymore,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Yimou Lee; additional reporting by Diego Ore in Mexico City; Writing by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Tom Hogue, Kim Coghill and Chris Reese)\n"

        "Title": "AMD Looks to Challenge Nvidia With a New Chip. Can the Stock Be the Next Big AI Chip Winner?",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) recently introduced its latest artificial intelligence (AI) chip as it looks to make a dent in Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) huge market share. While AMD, as it is commonly called, has seen its AI-related revenue soar this year, it's still just a fraction of the revenue generated by its rival's graphic processing units (GPUs).\nThe question is, can this new chip help AMD become the next big AI winner?\nAMD has steadily increased its revenue for data center GPUs this year from an original forecast of more than $3.5 billion to most recently $4.5 billion. However, that pales in comparison to the $26.3 billion in data center revenue that Nvidia generated just last quarter.\nThe semiconductor company is hoping that its newest chip, called the Instinct MI325X, will help close some of the large share gap in GPUs between the two companies. AMD said the new chip offers industry-leading memory capacity and bandwidth and more compute power than Nvidia's H200 chip. However, it is notable that the comparison is to Nvidia's Hopper architecture and not its newest Blackwell architecture. For its part, Nvidia claims Blackwell can have 30 times the inference performance as Hopper.\nAMD said the new chip will begin production in Q4 and be ready for widespread shipment in early 2025. It said the chips will be available through a wide set of platform providers, including Dell, Super Micro Computer, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, among others. Like Nvidia, AMD is moving its AI chip development cycle up to about once a year.\nThe company also introduced some networking solutions, including a new NIC (network interface card) and DPU (data processing unit). NICs are needed to connect to a network, while DPUs handle data transfers, compression, and storage. It also introduced a new line of CPUs (central processing units) called EPYC 5th Gen, which it said has been designed to accelerate data center, cloud, and AI workloads.\nMeanwhile, AMD said it is adding some powerful new features and capabilities to its ROCm open software stack. While AMD has produced powerful GPUs in the past, Nvidia's CUDA software has long been a huge advantage for the company, since developers have long been trained to program GPUs through its platform. This has created a wide moat for Nvidia that AMD and others have struggled to compete against.\nAMD did not announce any new customers for its new products, but representatives from Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and OpenAI did discuss how they are using AMD at the event. Meta noted that it is \"working on several training workloads with AMD.\"\nThere was nothing from AMD's announcement that indicates it will take any meaningful share from Nvidia in the near future. However, the AI infrastructure market is expanding so quickly and Nvidia only has so much supply capacity, that there will still be a nice opportunity for AMD to grow its AI chip business. In addition, companies will want to keep Nvidia honest and have at least a second GPU supplier, so that it does not become a complete monopoly.\nThere were also some comments from customers that suggest AMD's GPUs are being given some more important workloads than in the past. This combined with the strong overall market for GPUs should see the company continue to produce solid AI revenue growth, just off a much lower base than Nvidia. And at the end of the day, AMD doesn't need to take a ton of share from Nvidia to be an AI winner. Going from a 4% market share to 7% in a widely expanding market would still be a lot of growth.\nFrom a valuation standpoint, AMD currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 30 based on 2025 analyst estimates. That's a fair valuation given the potential growth the company has in front of it from AI.\nAMD is likely not going to be the next Nvidia, but it is a solid secondary option in the space for investors who want to diversify their AI stock holdings. As long as the market for AI infrastructure is growing strongly, the stock should be a solid performer.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

That level would be reached several times, with shares splitting multiple times since 2000.\nTo celebrate the occasion of shares hitting $100, Huang promised company executives he would get the Nvidia logo as a tattoo.\nIn a 2017 interview with Fortune, Huang revealed the tattoo and shared more details.\n\u201cSo, I really want to extend it. I actually kinda do. I would love to. But getting it really, really hurt,\u201d Huang said.\nHuang said his family was with him when he got his tattoo.\n\u201cI was crying like a baby. My kids were with me, and they were like, \u2018Dad, you\u2019ve gotta control yourself.'\u201d\nHuang mentioned that a semi-annual meeting from years ago was the inspiration behind the tattoo.\n\u201cAnd at one, someone said, \u2018What are we gonna do when the stock price hits $100?'\u201d\nHuang recalled that others said they would shave their head, paint their hair a new color, get a mohawk and even get a nipple ring.\n\u201cSo I said, \u2018Yeah all right, I\u2019ll get a tattoo.'\u201d\nThe first picture that can be found online of Huang\u2019s tattoo comes from the Nvidia Gaming Festival, with a post on Nvidia\u2019s Instagram on Oct. 25, 2014.\n\u201cNVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsu Huang shows off his NVDIA tattoo at the NVIDIA Gaming Festival,\u201d the post reads.\nIt is unknown when Huang got his tattoo, but it doesn\u2019t sound like more will be added to his arms anytime soon.\n\u201cAging gracefully.

Read them carefully before investing.\nInvesting $1,000 in Nvidia Stock: With the date unknown, when exactly Huang got his tattoo, a starting point for when the tattoo was unveiled to the public can be used.\nThe Nvidia Instagram post with Huang\u2019s tattoo was shared on Oct. 25, 2014, which fell on the weekend. Shares opened at $18.48 on the following Monday.\nA $1,000 investment at the time could have bought 54.11 NVDA shares. Nvidia stock split four-for-one in July 2021 and 10-for-1 in June 2024. This would have turned the initial share count into 2,164.40 shares.\nThe $1,000 investment would be worth $268,299.02 today. This represents a potential return of +26,729.9%.\nCompare that to a $1,000 investment in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which tracks the S&P 500. A $1,000 investment in the ETF on the same day could have bought 5.11 SPY shares at the time. The $1,000 investment would be worth $2,915.31 today, representing a potential return of 191.5%.\nAnother point of reference could have been to buy Nvidia shares after the Fortune interview, which labeled Huang the Businessperson of the Year and made the tattoo more of a storyline for the public.\nA $1,000 investment could have purchased 4.67 shares of Nvidia on Nov. 16, 2017, at a price of $214.20. The stock splits would have turned the investment into 186.80 NVDA shares. The $1,000 investment would be worth $23,155.73 today, representing a return of 2,215.6%.\nThe same $1,000 invested in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust on the same date could have purchased 3.89 SPY shares, which would be worth $2,219.28. This represents a potential return of 121.9%.\nInvestors who followed Huang's tattoo journey and recognized Nvidia's potential for future milestones would be incredibly grateful today.\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

        "Title": "AMD Looks to Challenge Nvidia With a New Chip. Can the Stock Be the Next Big AI Chip Winner?",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) recently introduced its latest artificial intelligence (AI) chip as it looks to make a dent in Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) huge market share. While AMD, as it is commonly called, has seen its AI-related revenue soar this year, it's still just a fraction of the revenue generated by its rival's graphic processing units (GPUs).\nThe question is, can this new chip help AMD become the next big AI winner?\nAMD has steadily increased its revenue for data center GPUs this year from an original forecast of more than $3.5 billion to most recently $4.5 billion. However, that pales in comparison to the $26.3 billion in data center revenue that Nvidia generated just last quarter.\nThe semiconductor company is hoping that its newest chip, called the Instinct MI325X, will help close some of the large share gap in GPUs between the two companies. AMD said the new chip offers industry-leading memory capacity and bandwidth and more compute power than Nvidia's H200 chip. However, it is notable that the comparison is to Nvidia's Hopper architecture and not its newest Blackwell architecture. For its part, Nvidia claims Blackwell can have 30 times the inference performance as Hopper.\nAMD said the new chip will begin production in Q4 and be ready for widespread shipment in early 2025. It said the chips will be available through a wide set of platform providers, including Dell, Super Micro Computer, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, among others. Like Nvidia, AMD is moving its AI chip development cycle up to about once a year.\nThe company also introduced some networking solutions, including a new NIC (network interface card) and DPU (data processing unit). NICs are needed to connect to a network, while DPUs handle data transfers, compression, and storage. It also introduced a new line of CPUs (central processing units) called EPYC 5th Gen, which it said has been designed to accelerate data center, cloud, and AI workloads.\nMeanwhile, AMD said it is adding some powerful new features and capabilities to its ROCm open software stack. While AMD has produced powerful GPUs in the past, Nvidia's CUDA software has long been a huge advantage for the company, since developers have long been trained to program GPUs through its platform. This has created a wide moat for Nvidia that AMD and others have struggled to compete against.\nAMD did not announce any new customers for its new products, but representatives from Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and OpenAI did discuss how they are using AMD at the event. Meta noted that it is \"working on several training workloads with AMD.\"\nThere was nothing from AMD's announcement that indicates it will take any meaningful share from Nvidia in the near future. However, the AI infrastructure market is expanding so quickly and Nvidia only has so much supply capacity, that there will still be a nice opportunity for AMD to grow its AI chip business. In addition, companies will want to keep Nvidia honest and have at least a second GPU supplier, so that it does not become a complete monopoly.\nThere were also some comments from customers that suggest AMD's GPUs are being given some more important workloads than in the past. This combined with the strong overall market for GPUs should see the company continue to produce solid AI revenue growth, just off a much lower base than Nvidia. And at the end of the day, AMD doesn't need to take a ton of share from Nvidia to be an AI winner. Going from a 4% market share to 7% in a widely expanding market would still be a lot of growth.\nFrom a valuation standpoint, AMD currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 30 based on 2025 analyst estimates. That's a fair valuation given the potential growth the company has in front of it from AI.\nAMD is likely not going to be the next Nvidia, but it is a solid secondary option in the space for investors who want to diversify their AI stock holdings. As long as the market for AI infrastructure is growing strongly, the stock should be a solid performer.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Text": "Investing.com -- Morgan Stanley analysts provided their view on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GB200 server rack production, noting that recent supply chain checks suggest no further delays in shipments.\nConcerns had arisen in the market regarding Nvidia's Blackwell platform, specifically about supply and demand uncertainties, but the production process appears to be on track, according to the investment bank.\n\"Our latest supply chain checks suggest no further delay for GB200 server rack shipments,\" Morgan Stanley states.\nThey also noted that no leakage problems have been spotted, and cable connection issues can be resolved through manufacturing adjustments. Production rollout is scheduled for November 2024, with the first batch of shipments expected by the end of the year.\nThe bank highlights that while both NVL36 and NVL72 designs should hit the market by late 2024, \"NVL72 should be the customer preference for high computing power density and better cost-effectiveness in the long term.\"\nMoreover, Morgan Stanley says some tier-one server buyers will have access to the Blackwell platform around the year-end, while broader shipments to the rest of the market are likely to begin by the end of the first quarter in 2025.\nThey explain that due to the immense power consumption of GB200 server racks, however, most enterprise buyers may prefer HGX/MGX servers for the Blackwell platform.\nMorgan Stanley's analysis suggests that Nvidia's supply chain remains strong, with growth expected in high-speed switches and large-scale 800G switch shipments projected for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\"We see the supply chain continuing to progress to mass production toward year-end,\" writes Morgan Stanley.\nWhile volatility may persist in the short term, the bank remains optimistic, particularly on companies like Wistron, Accton, and Hon Hai for their relationships with Nvidia and contributions to the AI hardware supply chain.\nRelated Articles\nNvidia: Morgan Stanley checks suggest no further GB200 server rack shipment delay\nUS East Coast dockworkers strike, halting half the nation's ocean shipping\nCVC-backed Moove Lubricants targets up to $1.9 billion valuation in US IPO\n"

        "Text": "On Oct 14, Goldman Sachs (GS, Financial) raised the target price for Nvidia(NVDA, Financial) to $150 from $135, reflecting the semiconductor giant's strong positioning to dominate the AI space. This update comes as the stock market begins to soar, with Nvidia's valuation moving closer to becoming one of the world's most valuable companies.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nNvidia's market capitalization has increased by around $780 billion since early September, surpassing Microsoft's market cap and nearing Apple's $3.46 trillion mark. This growth is primarily due to Nvidia's leading position in the global AI chip and processor market, which is experiencing a surge in investments as the world embraces AI.\nAnalyst Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs attributed the revised price target to the increasing complexity of AI workloads and Nvidia's strategic initiatives to meet this demand. Nvidia's new developments will likely support the growing need for AI chips from hyper scalers Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) and Alphabet (GOOGL, Financial), which are expanding their AI usage.\nFurthermore, expectations are high that Nvidia's new Blackwell platform and the continued success of its Hopper GPUs will boost sales. These trends suggest that Nvidia could capture a larger share of U.S. cloud companies' capital expenditures, which are expected to rise significantly in the coming years.\nGoldman Sachs' update on price targets reflects a positive outlook on Nvidia's strategic position in the AI market, especially on the upcoming Blackwell chip and its role in the technology sector.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "The Market Just Set a New All-Time High. Will Nvidia Do the Same?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "While there are many measures of what \"the market\" is, the most common reference is to the S&P 500, which is made up of the 500 largest U.S.-listed companies. This gives investors a fairly diversified representation across all market sectors, which is why it's typically used as a baseline. The S&P 500 has notched new all-time highs for a couple of days in a row, but that doesn't mean every stock is also hitting new all-time highs.\nAlthough Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been an excellent investment in 2024, it is not one of the stocks that has hit a new all-time high recently, although it's not far from achieving that. It's about 10% off its all-time high, but that stock has rallied aggressively in the last few days.\nWill Nvidia notch a new all-time high in the coming days?\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been at the top of their industry for a long time. However, only recently has that best-in-class accolade paid off. Because GPUs can process multiple calculations in parallel, they are ideal for arduous computing tasks. Originally, GPUs were intended for processing gaming graphics, thus the name. Eventually, they found their way to other use cases, like engineering simulations, cryptocurrency mining, and artificial intelligence (AI) model training.\nThe latter has caused Nvidia's demand to explode, as many of the largest tech companies raced to build the most powerful AI-training servers possible. This means filling them with thousands of Nvidia GPUs, which caused Nvidia's business to boom.\nSince 2023, this has led Nvidia's revenue to skyrocket.\nBut the growth isn't over, and it will likely push Nvidia's stock higher to notch a new all-time high.\nWhile the second quarter saw impressive 122% year-over-year revenue growth to $30 billion, Nvidia isn't done yet. Management expects $32.5 billion in revenue for third-quarter fiscal year 2025 (ending around Oct. 31). This would indicate revenue growth of 80%. Nvidia's revenue growth is slowing, as it's starting to come up against quarters where revenue was higher. But, with revenue projected to grow at a quarter-over-quarter pace of 8%, it's still seeing strong demand.\nQ3 isn't the end for Nvidia, either. For FY 2025, Wall Street analysts project an average of $125.5 billion in revenue. If Nvidia hits Q3 expectations on the nose, that would indicate fourth-quarter revenue should be around $37 billion -- a further healthy increase from previous quarters' levels. That growth will extend into FY 2026 as well, according to analysts. They think Nvidia will produce revenue of $178 billion, which would be massive 42% growth.\nShould Nvidia hit that target and maintain its current 55% profit margin, it would produce a net income of $97.9 billion. If all those projections are hit and the stock price doesn't move, Nvidia's stock would trade for 31 times trailing earnings at the end of FY 2026.\nAlthough 31 times earnings may sound expensive, it's unlikely that Nvidia would trade at that low a level, considering that the company would likely still be growing at a strong pace at that time.\nSo, whether it is in one week, one month, or a year from now, Nvidia is likely heading for a new all-time high. With strong future prospects, Nvidia looks like it could be a buy again, but with high expectations already built into the stock, don't expect it to double anytime soon. Instead, Nvidia should be looked at as a stock that can consistently beat the market by outperforming it by a few percentage points each year.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Philip van Doorn ",
        "Text": "As another corporate earnings season begins, veteran investors won\u2019t be surprised to see headlines about companies beating estimates for revenue and profits. The combination of companies\u2019 guidance and Wall Street analysts\u2019 own estimates sets up an underpromise/overdeliver scenario.\nTypically, between 70% and 80% of companies in the S&P 500 SPX report profit (at least) that comes in ahead of expectations.\n\u2018This money is not bringing me a lot of happiness\u2019: My husband and I have $7 million, but our kids are trouble.

Should I take out a HELOC or dip into my 401(k) to bail her out?\nThose beats set up increases to consensus earnings estimates for subsequent quarters and entire fiscal years. Although the beats are expected, their flow is important to help support rising share prices over the long term.\nSo now the question is whether or not Nvidia Corp. NVDA has more blowout quarters ahead. The company\u2019s stock has returned 172% this year, with dividends reinvested, following a 239% increase in 2023. The stock now trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36.7, based on Thursday\u2019s closing price and the consensus 12-month earnings-per-share estimate among analysts polled by FactSet. This might seem high when compared with the S&P 500\u2019s weighted forward P/E of 21.8, but Nvidia has been increasing its profits much more quickly than the index has. And Nvidia\u2019s forward P/E was 34.5 at the end of 2022, while the S&P 500\u2019s forward P/E was 16.7.\nThe company is expected to release its next set of results on Nov. 14, for its fiscal quarter that ends Oct. 27. But Emily Bary looked further ahead to explain why Nvidia\u2019s January quarter is likely to begin a new cycle of dramatic beats for sales and profits.\nMore Nvidia and related coverage:\nWhen you\u2019re shopping around for a new home, you might fall in love with a particular house.

But perhaps they should have arrived even later, as we're now hearing word that the chips might have been rushed to market too soon.\nTech site The Information (via Business Korea) reports that \"during testing of the Blackwell chips in the weeks after Huang's announcement, Nvidia engineers discovered that the chips failed in the types of high-voltage environments that are common in data centers\". This is supposedly according to \"two people with direct knowledge of the problem\".\nThe two sides are apparently blaming each other for this, with TSMC saying Nvidia rushed production and Nvidia saying the defects are due to TSMC's packaging tech. Whoever's to blame, the result seems to be tension in a three decade-long relationship between the two companies.\nWhich isn't to say there's been 30 years of uninterrupted partnership. Perhaps most prominently, the relationship was punctuated by an intermission for Nvidia's 30-series 'Ampere' GPUs, which it had Samsung produce. Now, The Information suggests that Nvidia could ditch TSMC for Samsung once again and hopes to receive a 20\u201330% discount compared to TSMC.\nYeah, and I hope for a 20\u201330% tax break. What, wishes aren't fishes?\nI don't buy it. The fact is, TSMC is the only real game in town right now for Nvidia. It has more advanced process nodes and it doesn't have to reserve any of its fabrication for its own chips because it produces solely for third parties.\nPlus, Nvidia's unlikely to have forgotten that the last time it partnered with Samsung, things didn't turn out so well, with skyrocketing prices and GPU shortages. Yes, unfortunate world events led to this, but the results were what they were and, unfortunately for Samsung, nothing can be done about that now.\nYour next upgrade\nBest CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest.\nSamsung's not been doing amazingly of late, with its stock prices falling and foreign investors selling shares in the company. However, it's not all doom and gloom, as the chip giant is still a giant. Along with TSMC, it's been eyeballing the Middle East for new fabs and is still planning on ploughing into 1.4 nm production.\nBut TSMC still remains a better choice, even if relations are strained right now due to chip defects. Hell, it's just booked a 39% increase in sales compared to Q3 last year. The market's really booming in TSMC's favour right now.\nIf all The Information reports is correct, what seems more likely is that Nvidia's angling for a better deal than it's currently getting.\nLet's just hope these supposed defects don't make their way into the RTX 50-series batches that should launch early next year.\n"

        "Text": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nIf someone asked you to guess which S&P 500 stock has gained the most in share value this year, you might be inclined to go with Nvidia. It would be a good guess, but it would be incorrect. Vistra, an energy stock, is the correct answer. This company's stock is up roughly 300% on the year and almost 40% in September alone.\nThat's strong enough to make it the top-gaining stock in the S&P 500 this year. So, what makes Vistra (NYSE: VST) so special? As it turns out, chipmakers like Nvidia are not the only beneficiaries of AI's emergence as \"the next big thing\" in the public and private sectors. Energy companies are also seeing a kick-on effect, mainly because AI's appetite for data only matches its appetite for power.\nCheck It Out:\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\nCan you guess how much the average retirement account balance is? Here\u2019s a hint \u2014 it\u2019s only slightly more than a year\u2019s worth of expenses.\nThat's good news for energy stocks, but especially for Vistra because of the type of power it provides. Vistra specializes in operating nuclear power facilities, which AI companies and data center operators increasingly look to as an energy source for the new hyperscale data centers.\nInvestors are beginning to realize that AI can't reach its potential without access to ample power. Vistra has a jump on the competition because it already has nuclear plants online. These facilities cost billions to construct and take years to come online, but AI's power demands are already beginning to strain local power grids, making energy companies very popular with investors.\nAnalysts like Antoine Aurimond of Jeffries have taken notice, recently raising his outlook on Vistra's stock price from $99 to $137. If Vistra continues its upward climb, it might hit those numbers. Vistra shares were trading around $38 in January but have since rocketed to $118.54. That news will come as music to the ears of Vistra shareholders.\nTrending: Get \u2018em while you can \u2014 investing in this asset class may be reaching a high-water mark but you can still make returns right now.\nAurimond told Marketwatch why he expects continued growth for Vistra, saying, \u201cThe grid is going to be super tight in terms of supply/demand and there's just not enough new capacity coming online because that takes time.\" He's not alone in his bullish predictions on Vistra, as Morgan Stanley analyst David Arcaro has raised his expectations for Vistra shares from $110 to $132.\nMuch of the excitement surrounding Vistra and nuclear power providers in general tracks back to energy deals between nuclear energy provider Constellation and Microsoft or Talen Energy's similar pact with Amazon. Although that kind of deal is not currently on the table for Vistra, it's clear many investors and analysts believe there is potential for one.\nAurimond also pointed out that Vistra has a few other cards that make it a potential long-term winner. Vistra's operation is not as large as Constellation's, but other aspects of Vistra's infrastructure may give it an advantage. Aurimond told Marketwatch that Vistra is \"one of the biggest holders of efficient gas plants across the country,\u201d which he said \"could be a huge source of upside.\"\nThe AI revolution is evolving every day and like the internal combustion engine, it will change how the world works in ways that are currently unimaginable. That will create tremendous opportunities for investors in multiple sectors, including energy and data centers. Vistra's performance this year is just the latest example of that.\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today.

        "Text": "US stocks closed higher across the board on Tuesday as investors welcomed a rebound in tech and a pullback in surging oil prices, putting the focus back on interest rates and the state of the US economy.\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose around 1.5% as tech megacaps recouped the previous session's losses. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) stepped up around 1% to close within striking distance of its previous record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up roughly 0.3%.\nChipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) led the bounce back in stocks, rising another 4% on Tuesday to close out its fifth straight day of gains amid continued bullishness around artificial intelligence.\nOther \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks also regained ground lost amid recent negative headlines, with Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) all finishing the session firmly in the green.\nMeanwhile, oil prices retreated as Mideast tensions somewhat cooled. Prices also came under pressure after China failed to roll out another large stimulus package on Tuesday, a surprise to investors hoping to add more fuel to the unprecedented rally.\nStocks in Hong Kong (^HSI) slumped over 9%, as a roaring stimulus-fueled rally in Chinese stocks fizzled out.\nInvestors also turned their attention to monetary policy with markets still grappling with busted hopes for jumbo interest rate cuts.\nNew York Fed president John Williams told the Financial Times on Tuesday that Federal Reserve policy is \"well positioned\" to nail a \"soft landing\" for the economy. Meanwhile, Fed governor Adriana Kugler said data will continue to drive rate decisions.\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nThose comments sharpened investors' focus on the CPI inflation report due Thursday, which will provide further clues on the path forward for interest rates.\nStocks closed in a sea of green on Tuesday, led by AI heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA).\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose around 1.5%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed within striking distance of its previous record high, rising about 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up roughly 0.3%, or more than 100 points.\nNvidia stock is doing the number go up meme again. \nThe stock rose more than 3% on Tuesday \u2014 marking its fifth straight day of gains \u2014 as shares quickly approach their all-time closing high of $135.58. Since its recent low on Aug. 7, the stock is now up more than 34%.\nThat includes a significant drawdown after Wall Street largely felt the AI juggernaut's recent earnings release was good but not good enough. Investors were concerned about signs of slowing revenue growth in the coming quarters and the potential for an overall cooling in the AI spending spree.\nBut in the past month, those concerns seem to have gone by the wayside. The stock rose more than 5% in a single trading session after CEO Jensen Huang touted \"insane\" demand for its next-generation Blackwell chip in a CNBC interview. On Tuesday, the stock chugged higher as Nvidia further highlighted the use cases for its AI software and services at a D.C. AI summit.\nThe stock pop Tuesday was the latest sign that after all the turbulence around the stock in August, investors are clearly still bulled up on the AI theme and searching for reasons to buy the stock.\nTrump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended gains by another 13% on Tuesday after closing more than 10% higher on Monday.\nThe moves come as investors assess current Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris's recent media appearances, along with a surprise cameo by Elon Musk at Donald Trump's rally in Butler, Pa., over the weekend. It was the same location where the former president survived an assassination attempt in July.\nTech billionaire Musk, who serves as the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX and also owns social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has been outspoken about his support of Trump ahead of next month's election.\nThe former president remains in a deadlocked race against Harris, who just embarked on a flurry of media appearances in an attempt to solidify recent momentum in the polls.\nHarris appeared on an episode of \"Call Her Daddy,\" a popular podcast catered toward Generation Z, along with a sit-down interview for CBS' \"60 Minutes.\"\nIn the one-on-one interview with CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker, Harris defended her proposals on the economy and immigration but was pressed on how she would fund some of these efforts.\nTrump backed out of an interview with the program last week after previously agreeing to the sit down, according to the network.\nRead more here.\nTechnology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) led Tuesday's sector action, up about 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively.\nTech megacaps, led by Nvidia (NVDA), pushed markets higher to recoup some of the previous session's losses, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) up more than 1%. Nvidia climbed as much as 4%, its highest intraday move since July, on more positive sentiment surrounding its Blackwell chips.\nEnergy was the day's biggest laggard after crude oil (CL=F) dropped roughly 4% to trade just above $74 a barrel. The drop comes after oil's recent rally, spurred by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, took a breather while China disappointed on more stimulus measures. Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also dropped 4% to hover north of $77.50.\nThe third quarter earnings reporting period will kick off in earnest when some of the nation's largest banks report quarterly results on Friday.\nWall Street projects earnings to grow 4.7%, which would mark the fifth straight quarter of growth since the same period a year prior. But it would also be the slowest year-over-year growth since the fourth quarter of 2023.\nGiven stocks have charged higher than normal between reporting periods, Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha isn't expecting the typical 2% rise in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) during the first four weeks of earnings reports.\n\"Earnings seasons are typically positive for equities, but the strong rally and above-average positioning going in argue for a muted market reaction,\" Chadha wrote in a note to clients.\nRead more here. \nThe recent surge in Chinese stocks hit the pause button on Tuesday after Beijing failed to roll out another large stimulus package, a surprise to investors hoping to add more fuel to the unprecedented rally.\nHong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index (^HSI), which is loaded with large Chinese stocks, dropped around 9% on Tuesday, its worst day since October 2008, after climbing around 20% over the past month on the heels of China unleashing its most aggressive monetary stimulus since the onset of the pandemic.\nChina\u2019s benchmark CSI 300 (000300.SS) also experienced a volatile day as expectations of a large stimulus announcement fueled an initial 10% rise after markets reopened from the country's weeklong holiday. The index later gave up those gains, finishing the day up a more modest 6%.\nThe stimulus, a response by China to course-correct its struggling economy, was first announced on Sept. 24. Since then, a surge of inflows has dramatically boosted Chinese equities, particularly in real estate and consumer staples, as investors bet on Beijing's comeback.\nAt a press conference on Tuesday hosted by China's top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Beijing said it's committed to enacting further support in order to reach its economic goals, which includes an annual growth target of \"around 5%.\"\nOn Tuesday, the Shanghai Composite (000888.SS) still eked out gains of around 5%. The index has rallied by double digits, jumping more than 20% from its September lows. It's up about 30% over the past month.\nSimilarly, shares of Chinese e-commerce giants like Alibaba (BABA) and PDD Holdings (PDD) have surged over that same period, up more than 35% and 55%, respectively, despite single-digit losses on Tuesday.\nRead more about what this could mean for investors here.\nOil sank on Tuesday as the recent rally stemming from the Middle East conflict took a pause and China disappointed investors on its stimulus.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) tanked more than 4.5% while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also slipped more than 4.5%.\nThe reversal comes after crude futures surged about 12% over the past five sessions on speculation that a retaliatory move from Tel Aviv against Tehran in the ongoing Middle East conflict could involve targeting Iran's oil infrastructure.\n\"The delayed response by Israel to counterattack could mean further talks may happen first,\" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading for BOK Financial Securities, said in a note on Tuesday.\n\"Oil futures had moved to an 'overbought' condition and without underlying escalation of attacks a corrective phase looks underway,\" he added.\nOil also came under pressure after a Chinese economic planner told reporters Beijing is \"fully confident\" the country will meet its 2024 targets but made no mention of any large or new measures, signaling stalled demand from the world's largest oil importer.\nApple's iPhone 16 (AAPL) may have had more momentum out of the gate than its predecessor, according to KeyBanc analysts. But it's not enough to quell concerns about sales overall.\nKeyBanc analysts said in a note Tuesday that spending on the iPhone 16 in the first 10 days after its launch in September was 12% higher than it was in the same period following the iPhone 15's rollout.\nKeyBanc based its conclusions off data from nearly 2 million KeyBank credit and debit card customers, looking at Apple transactions greater than $400.\nKeyBanc said the data \"does appear more positive than we would have anticipated.\" But analysts said iPhone 16 demand faded quickly: \"We saw initial strong demand for iPhone 16, but momentum tailed off.\"\n\"The data should calm concerns on the September quarter, though does little to change our more cautious view on the 'super cycle,' as upgrade rates are likely to continue to decline.\"\nSo far, Wall Street has perceived the iPhone 16 launch as somewhat weak. Analysts have cited shorter shipping times for the iPhone 16 than past iPhones. In other words, demand must be weaker if people are waiting less to get their new iPhones.\nUS stocks opened higher on Tuesday after all three major indexes closed Monday's session in the red.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) each climbed around 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged up roughly 0.3%.\nOil prices, which have surged amid Middle East tensions, retreated early Tuesday. Crude oil (CL=F) fell about 3% to trade just below $75 a barrel.\nPepsiCo (PEP) lowered its sales outlook for the year, forecasting organic revenue growth in the low single digits below the previously expected 4% growth. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, PepsiCo's third quarter revenue trailed behind Wall Street's estimates, coming in at $23.3 billion, versus the $23.8 billion expected.\nCEO Ramon Laguarta said in the release that Pepsi's performance was impacted by \"subdued category performance trends in North America,\" the impact of recalls at Quaker Foods North America, and business disruptions from \"rising geopolitical tensions in certain international markets.\" In a phone interview with Yahoo Finance, Laguarta said consumers are \"very challenged\" and they are making a \"lot of trade-offs\" when it comes to food. Those trade-offs are weighing on the snacks business most acutely, Laguarta explained.\nPepsiCo stock fell nearly 1% in premarket trading. Read the full story here.\n"

Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. \nNvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains.\nThe stock\u2019s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips.\nNvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by an abundance of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs \u201cremains extremely robust.\u201d A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia\u2019s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday.\nNvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan\u2019s largest supercomputer during Foxconn\u2019s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it\u2019s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia\u2019s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions.\nNvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday after market close, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year.\nNvidia\u2019s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company\u2019s second quarter earnings.\nShares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China due to rising trade tensions with the US had also driven shares down. Nvidia\u2019s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June.\nOther recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations \u2014 another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term.\n\u201cAI is hot,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, \u201cI see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.\u201d\nThe chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech\u2019s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown.\nSemiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia\u2019s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet \u201ccrazy\u201d demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell chips has been \u201cinsane.\u201d\nNvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

Accenture has trained 30,000 experts on the use of Nvidia\u2019s technology to help their customers deploy and get benefits from it rapidly.\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s chips dominate deployments of AI hardware, orders are mainly coming from a handful of owners of large data centers, such as Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Analysts and investors have expressed concern that tens of billions of dollars they\u2019re spending on new infrastructure hasn\u2019t yet provided a financial return that justifies the outlay.\nNvidia has responded by launching a flurry of software, services and hardware that makes the technology accessible and valuable to a broader set of customers, all aimed at perpetuating what Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang says is a new industrial revolution.\nHuang said on CNBC that he sees Accenture as the \u201cconnecting fabric\u201d between its technology and customers. He and Accenture CEO Julie Sweet first imagined the partnership about four months ago, Huang said.\nNvidia\u2019s CEO also gave an update on the company\u2019s new Blackwell chip lineup, which is in full production and coming together as planned.

The stock's rally follows recent comments from CEO Jensen Huang and the chipmaker's partners touting an intense need for the company's AI chips.\nOther AI chip and hardware stocks Arm (ARM), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Astera Labs (ALAB), and Micron (MU) have risen, too, as the companies have given separate indications of strong demand for their products, thanks to the AI boom. TSMC (TSM) stock also closed at a record high Monday.\nAll in all, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) is up 4.5% over the past five days, outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which rose 2.9% over the same time frame.\nThe upward trajectory of AI chip stocks is a positive sign for AI hardware spending that assuages Wall Street\u2019s concerns of a near-term slowdown on investment.\n\"While Phase 2 stocks [i.e. AI infrastructure-related stocks, such as Arm, TSMC, and SMCI] appear modestly expensive relative to history, it is possible that the demand for AI leads the mega-cap tech stocks to spend even more on AI-related capex than investors and analysts currently expect,\" Goldman Sachs (GS) analysts wrote in their report on Oct. 10.\nGoogle (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) have all indicated that they will continue to spend large sums on AI infrastructure through next year, to the benefit of AI hardware companies, led by Nvidia.

        "Text": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) notched a record high closing price as investors continue to bet on the artificial intelligence boom, placing the chipmaker in contention for the top spot as Wall Street's most valuable company.\nShares rose 2.4% Monday to above $138. Nvidia previously hit a record closing price of $135.58 in June. \nNvidia stock has risen sharply in October, at one point posting six consecutive days of gains.\nThe stock\u2019s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Much of that funding will be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips.\nNvidia shares continued their upward trajectory, fueled by an abundance of good news for the AI chipmaker. Wall Street analysts last week reiterated their Buy ratings on Nvidia shares. KeyBanc released a report estimating that Nvidia revenues from its new Blackwell chips alone will reach $7 billion in the fourth quarter, while demand for its older GPUs \u201cremains extremely robust.\u201d A potential new wave of funding for AI startups would add to Nvidia\u2019s coffers as well, Wedbush analysts said Tuesday.\nNvidia also showcased the strength of its software offerings during its AI Summit in Washington, D.C. The same day, Nvidia and Foxconn announced plans to build Taiwan\u2019s largest supercomputer during Foxconn\u2019s annual technology showcase event in Taipei. Foxconn also provided details about a megafactory it\u2019s building to assemble Nvidia servers using its Grace Blackwell chips in Mexico, reducing Nvidia\u2019s reliance on China amid heightened trade tensions.\nNvidia's gains on Monday also put it closer to unseating Apple as the world's most valuable company. The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.4 trillion Monday after market close, while Apple's was $3.5 trillion. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year.\nNvidia\u2019s ascent has more than reversed earlier declines following the release of the company\u2019s second quarter earnings.\nShares sank in late August after Nvidia failed to beat analyst expectations as much as investors had hoped. They fell further on a Bloomberg report that the company was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice in early September, which Nvidia denied. Fears of disruptions to demand from China due to rising trade tensions with the US had also driven shares down. Nvidia\u2019s recent volatility has been amplified by its 10-for-1 stock split in June.\nOther recent positive news in the semiconductor sector could aid Nvidia's rise. TSMC (TSM), one of Nvidia's chip manufacturers, reported sales above Wall Street's expectations \u2014 another indication that AI demand will stay strong in the near term.\n\u201cAI is hot,\u201d Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, told Yahoo Finance, adding, \u201cI see continued growth in the AI data center trades for the next 12 months.\u201d\nThe chip sector's gains signal that Big Tech\u2019s massive spending on AI hardware is far from finished, despite fears on Wall Street of a slowdown.\nSemiconductor industry sales rose 28% in August from the prior year and 15% from July, according to the most recent WSTS data reviewed by JPMorgan (JPM). Young Liu, the chair of Nvidia\u2019s server manufacturer Foxconn (2354.TW), told Bloomberg Television in an interview Tuesday that the company is boosting capacity to meet \u201ccrazy\u201d demand for Nvidia AI chips, or GPUs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week in a CNBC interview that demand for Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell chips has been \u201cinsane.\u201d\nNvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report revenues of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped as much as 5% on Thursday as CEO Jensen Huang said demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips has been \"insane.\"\nIn an interview with CNBC on Wednesday after the market close, Huang confirmed the chips are in \"full production\" despite recent design issues that caused some delays in customer rollouts.\n\"Blackwell is as planned,\" Huang said. \"Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first.\"\nBlackwell delays have caused concern for investors, with many looking to the rollout as the next big catalyst for the chipmaker after a recent stock slump fueled by a mid-July sell-off from the unwinding of the yen carry trade.\nSince then, markets have seen a rotation out of Big Tech while other macroeconomic factors, such as China trade fears, have also hampered Nvidia's stock price.\nBut investors and analysts alike remain largely confident in the trajectory of the artificial intelligence trade. Nvidia's stock is still up about 170% over the last 12 months and more than 2,700% over the last five years. Year to date, Nvidia has gained around 150%.\n90% of Wall Street analysts recommend the stock as a Buy, with the majority predicting that shares will rise to around $147.60 over the next year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\nOn top of its latest Blackwell update, Nvidia's move to the upside also comes as the company backed ChatGPT developer OpenAI (MSFT) in its latest funding round, which concluded on Wednesday.\nOpenAI was able to raise an additional $6.6 billion to reach a valuation of $157 billion in another bullish sign for the AI boom.\nGil Luria, senior software analyst at DA Davidson, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance that \"there's a direct flow from the funding round that was announced today to Nvidia\" due to data center demand that would benefit the chipmaker. \"That's why the stock's up today,\" he said.\nYahoo Finance's Laura Bratton contributed to this report. \nAlexandra is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 4% in Tuesday, notching its fifth straight day of gains.\nWall Street analysts at KeyBanc, Citi (C), Bernstein, and several other investment firms reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock this week.\nKeyBanc analysts raised their fiscal year 2025 sales outlook for Nvidia from $128.5 billion to $130.6 billion, with Nvidia\u2019s new flagship Blackwell AI chips contributing $7 billion to fourth quarter revenues. That\u2019s higher than Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimate of $125.6 billion for 2025 revenue, according to Bloomberg data.\nEven as production of Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chips ramps up, KeyBanc said in a note to investors Monday that demand for Nvidia\u2019s prior AI chip models \u2014 H100s and H200s \u2014 \u201cremains extremely robust.\u201d\nNvidia shares are up nearly 14% over the past week and 190% from last year.\nWedbush analysts said \u201canother positive data point\u201d for Nvidia is a potential new wave of funding for AI startups. The Information reported Monday that OpenAI\u2019s staggering $6.6 billion funding round will likely drive a wave of new AI investments. New funding for AI-related startups would, in turn, fuel demand for Nvidia's AI chips.\nWedbush\u2019s Matt Bryson said on Tuesday that the report is an indication \"that there is little likelihood AI spending growth pauses through much (if not all of 2025) to NVDA's benefit.\"\nNvidia is also looking to prove its worth beyond AI hardware. At its AI Summit in D.C. this week, the company is attempting to highlight the strength of its AI software offerings in a bid to show that it\u2019s more than just a chipmaker.\nAdding to the wave of positive press for Nvidia was the announcement of Foxconn's (2354.TW) new megafactory assembling Nvidia's AI servers. The chair of the Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer, Young Liu, said during an annual event in Taipei Tuesday that Foxconn is building the world\u2019s largest factory assembling Nvidia GB200 servers in Mexico, according to the Financial Times. Liu said there is \u201ccrazy\u201d demand for Nvidia\u2019s latest AI chips. The move will reduce Nvidia\u2019s reliance on China amid rising trade tensions.\nNvidia and Foxconn said they're also working to build Taiwan's fastest supercomputer.\nNvidia isn\u2019t the only semiconductor company that\u2019s thriving. Citing WSTS semiconductor industry data, JPMorgan (JPM) said Tuesday that sector-wide sales rose 28% in August from last year.\n\u201cWe remain positive on semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks as we believe stocks should continue to move higher in anticipation of better supply/demand in 2H24/25 [the second half of 2024 and 2025] and stable/rising earnings power trends in CY24/25 [the 2024 and 2025 calendar years].\u201d\nThe PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) both rose more than 1% on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, chipmakers in China faced a different fate Tuesday. After China\u2019s economic planning agency failed to live up to the market\u2019s hope for more stimulus measures, China\u2019s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (0981.HK) fell 18%.

The economic value of Nvidia is at $3.39 trillion and thus, it is behind Apple's $3.52 trillion only, but ahead of Microsoft's $3.12 trillion. This jump attests to solid investors' belief in Nvidia's present and future AI chip products.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nEarlier this year, Nividia briefly surpassed Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) to become the world's most valuable company. Nevertheless, the tech giants have since repositioned themselves thoroughly, and their market caps bounced around with more fluctuation for several more months.\nIndeed, Wall Street has placed Nvidia among critical contenders for the position of the market leader for next-gen AI tech, manufacturers of which include Alphabet (GOOGL, Financial), Amazon (AMZN, Financial), and Microsoft. TD Cowen analysts indicate that the investment environment in the AI space is competitive and calls for more Australia's needs to invest continuously, which investment is critical in preparing for potential obstacles in the burgeoning field.\nNvidia expects further sales growth even if it experiences a production slowdown of the Blackwell chips it is expected to release. Sales of other chips for artificial intelligence deployments are expected to remain steady at least. TD Cowen has placed Nvidia as their Top Pick for investment, and the firm reaffirms its price target of $165.\nBefore the reporting season starts emotions are also rather high: both Apple and Microsoft have increased their movements which led to S&P 500 record. Nvidia along with companies like Apple and Microsoft jointly hold appreciable weight at the S&P 500.\nAs we look ahead, Nvidia has forecasted revenue surge to almost $125.8 billion thanks to continued investments in AI data centres, according to LSEG data.

Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nHoward Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations.

        "Title": "Wall Street Analysts See Nvidia (NVDA) as a Buy: Should You Invest?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Nvidia (NVDA).\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.24, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 42 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.24 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 42 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.7% and 4.8% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Nvidia, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $2.81.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Jowi Morales ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nNvidia executives and directors have sold almost 11 million shares this year, amounting to over $1.8 billion. According to Bloomberg, this is the largest stock sale by company leadership in recent history after adjusting for stock splits. This amount represents less than 0.045% of the company\u2019s total astounding shares, but this news might put some downward pressure on Nvidia\u2019s stock price, especially with the delays on the Blackwell B200 GPUs.\nReports say that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently sold 6 million shares under a pre-arranged trading plan, meaning this move will happen regardless of what\u2019s happening with the company and in the market. This sale netted Huang about $713 million, but he still holds more than $100 billion worth of Nvidia shares.\nAnother big Nvidia sale was executed by Nvidia Director Mark Stevens, who has sold 1.6 million shares worth about $390 million so far in 2024. However, he has also filed for an additional sale of 3 million shares, which could net him over $731 million. Another director, Tench Coxe, has also made $525 million after selling some of his shares earlier this year.\nNvidia made the news earlier this year when its stock price hit record highs because of the AI GPU rush. This made the company the world\u2019s most valuable, jumping ahead of Apple, Microsoft, and Google in late June. Its market price has since corrected, with the stock price falling by about 10%. However, this still puts the company among the most valuable in market capitalization.\nThe company\u2019s rosy outlook might not last long, though, as some say that its AI valuation is\u00a0overhyped and in a bubble. Even Goldman Sachs is asking whether the massive investments made in hardware and AI training will ever pay off. It says that AI is currently too expensive and unreliable and that the industry needs to make at least $600 billion annually to break even.\nThese sales aren\u2019t a sign that its leadership expects Nvidia\u2019s stock price to tank, especially for Huang\u2019s pre-planned sales. The actions of some of its executives and directors do not indicate the direction that its shares will head. Although this does not build confidence for investors looking to get into the stock, the sales performance of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell chips will better show what the market thinks of the company and AI in general.\n"

        "Title": "Intel spends more on R&D than Nvidia and AMD combined, yet continues to lag in market cap \u2014 Nvidia spends almost 2X more than AMD",
        "Author": "  Anton Shilov ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nAMD and Nvidia's R&D budgets were quite similar ten years ago, but in recent years, Nvidia has been leaving its GPU rival behind in investment in this critical activity. According to the latest figures, Nvidia's spending on new technologies is about two times higher than that of AMD, according to Tech Fund. But while Nvidia's R&D spending easily eclipses AMD's, it is still way behind Intel and Qualcomm, and they all pale behind Apple's R&D expenditure.\nRegarding R&D spending, Nvidia invests in data center GPUs for AI and HPC (now its bread-and-butter business), client PC GPUs, networking gear, and DPUs that are used to support its data center products. Given how fast Nvidia's H100/H200 and B100/B200 datacenter GPUs are selling, the company can afford to fire up its research and development department on all cylinders to develop new GPUs.\nAlso, now that the company has set the stage with a yearly cadence of AI product releases, it is reasonable to expect it to increase its R&D spending. Indeed, it skyrocketed this year: as of July 28, Nvidia spent $3.090 billion on R&D this fiscal year, up a billion from last year.\nAs for AMD, it develops client and data center CPUs, client and data center GPUs, FPGAs, Pensando DPUs, and networking gear, which means the company can spend less than Nvidia on its product categories. Remember that AMD invests significantly in fundamental R&D technologies, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM). As of June 29, AMD spent $1.583 billion on research and development this fiscal year. Yet, AMD is committed to releasing new AI GPUs every year.\nWhile nowadays we tend to compare AMD to Nvidia and Nvidia to Intel, back in the day, we used to compare Intel to AMD, as these are the leading producers of processors based on the x86 instruction set architecture (ISA). Intel spends tremendous money on R&D: it spent over $16.5 billion in 2023, more than AMD and Nvidia combined.\nYet Intel spends on CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, networking gear, quantum computing, and many other products. Even though the current chief executive, Pat Gelsinger, has reduced the number of product categories and projects that Intel is pursuing, Intel still manages dozens of product categories and thousands of SKUs.\nBut more importantly, Intel spends billions on new semiconductor production process technologies. Every new manufacturing process typically requires billions in upfront research and development investments. Intel also develops packaging technologies, which require a lot of R&D money.\nQualcomm is, of course, another high spender on R&D. The company invests in system-on-chips for client devices like smartphones and PCs, RF technologies, and fundamental research for next-generation radio technologies (6G, 7G, etc.). Perhaps the most interesting part about Qualcomm is that among all the high-tech companies mentioned in this news story; it is the only one with a working 5G modem.\nAnd yet, the biggest R&D spender is Apple. Apple is not precisely a semiconductor company, and it has to invest in various projects, from Ion-X glass for the entry-level Apple Watch to premium M-series Max and Ultra processors for high-performance MacBook Pro laptops and Mac Studio desktops. Depending on how you count (based on the company's filings with the SEC following its fiscal year or based on approximated calendar spending), Apple spent around $27 billion or $29.915 billion on R&D in 2023, which is more than AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm combined.\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia is still the only game in town for companies spending hundreds of billions in the AI arms race\u2014and both the firm\u2019s customers and investors are well aware of that. The latest reminder came on Thursday when, on an otherwise tough morning for stocks, Nvidia shares jumped over 3% after CEO Jensen Huang touted blistering demand for its next-generation Blackwell line.\nHuang\u2019s comments on Wednesday coincided with a company announcement that it is partnering with IT consulting giant Accenture to sustain corporate AI adoption.\nNvidia controls roughly 90% of the market for advanced AI chips. The company has been shipping as many of its now-famous GPUs, which are all but essential for firms training AI models, as it can make. Huang admitted earlier this month that managing customer relationships can be \u201cemotional.\u201d\nClients see acquiring Nvidia\u2019s product as a zero-sum game: Chips bought by the competition are vital inputs they waste time waiting for. That\u2019s likely even more true for the Blackwell chips, which are bigger and more powerful than those in the current Hopper lineup.\n\u201cBlackwell is in full production, Blackwell is as planned, and the demand for Blackwell is insane,\u201d Huang told CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cEverybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.\u201d\nReports of design flaws and engineering snags delaying Blackwell\u2019s rollout may have weighed on the stock in recent months, but Nvidia is expected to begin selling the chips at the end of this year.\nThe insatiable demand should not be a surprise, Angelo Zino, a senior vice president and tech equity analyst at CFRA Research, recently told Fortune.\n\u201cWhen you kind of look at the performance boost that you\u2019re getting on Blackwell versus Hopper, every hyperscaler is going to aggressively buy this stuff up,\u201d he said. \u201cNot to mention enterprise customers and tier-two cloud players.\u201d\nThe generative AI boom, of course, quickly made Nvidia, which has added more than $2 trillion to its market cap in just over a year, one of the world\u2019s largest companies. The stock accounted for roughly 30% of the S&P 500\u2019s gains in the first half of the year, with shares up over 154% year to date.\nA dip earlier in the month saw the company shed almost $300 billion in market cap over a single day, the biggest-ever drop for an American company, which Zino attributed largely to a mix of both profit-taking and what he called \u201cAI fatigue.\u201d As tech giants tout the hundreds of billions they\u2019ve recently spent on AI, some have questioned how long it will take for shareholders to see returns on that investment.\nThere are also worries about whether companies outside of Big Tech are prepared and have the resources to adequately invest in AI adoption, even as they fear being left behind. \n\u201cThe Fortune 500 is not ready for gen AI, that\u2019s the real issue,\u201d Ted Mortonson, a managing director and tech desk strategist at Baird, recently told Fortune. \u201cSo, we\u2019re building infrastructure right now, but if you look at even the Accenture numbers, they basically said that 10% of the Fortune 500 [has] moved to the cloud and [is] gen AI ready.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s partnership with Accenture, which Huang said had been in the works for four months, bolsters the company\u2019s efforts to make AI tools more accessible to a broader set of clients.\nAs part of the new deal, Accenture will create what it calls an \u201cNvidia Business Group,\u201d which will consist of 30,000 employees focused on helping clients scale enterprise AI adoption and use tools like so-called digital agents. Accenture, which has credited $3 billion in new business to clients demanding help deploying gen AI, saw its stock rise 2% Thursday morning.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Demand for Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chips, which haven't been released yet, is huge.\nThe Wall Street Journal and The New York Times have documented how active networks of players are engaged in obtaining Nvidia's most powerful GPUs and shipping them to China.\nThe means can be as easy as forming companies outside China that will buy and ship the GPUs to the mainland.

There are even distributors who advertise online that they can get the chips, but it's unclear how they get their supplies.\nNvidia typically sells its GPUs and related products to other companies, such as Dell Technologies\u00a0 (DELL) , which installs them in server computers and related products.\nThe traffic flow of products and services may be only a stopgap since China supports home-grown companies that can produce chips that do what Nvidia's products can.\nBytedance, the parent of TikTok, is planning to develop an AI capability with chips from Huawei Technologies, the Chinese tech giant that is now the\u00a0world's largest smartphone maker, Reuters reported.\nWe may not have heard the end of this story, or seen the last of how it may impact Nvidia's stock price.\nRelated: The 10 best investing books, according to our stock market pros\n"

        "Author": "  Prosper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Getting to a $1 trillion market cap is such a challenging milestone that only a handful of corporations have done it. The list includes several tech giants, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Though this elite club is highly exclusive, more companies will eventually join it. Stocks that are headed that way might be worth serious consideration. Let's look at two: Visa (NYSE: V) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO). These companies could be trillion-dollar stocks by 2030.\nVisa runs one of the largest payment networks in the world, helping facilitate millions of daily credit card transactions. The company has delivered excellent returns during the past decade as cash transactions continue to be replaced by other payment forms. Visa's market cap is just under $550 billion as of this writing -- so it needs a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 10.5% to become a trillion-dollar company by the end of 2030. That's well within the company's powers. For one, Visa has performed much better than that during the past decade.\nOf course, that doesn't guarantee the company will deliver the same returns in the future, but some of the underlying factors that led to such solid performances in the past for the business are still in place. Visa remains a leader in its industry, with its only true noteworthy competitor being Mastercard (NYSE: MA). Visa still benefits from network effects: The more people carry credit cards that bear its logo, the more attractive its ecosystem becomes to merchants, and vice versa. That helps ensure that it will remain a major player in this industry for a while.\nVisa also still has plenty of room to grow. Credit card penetration is relatively high in many developed countries, but not so in others. In developing countries, there is even more potential. Visa sees a $20 trillion opportunity across a range of payments it can capture. The company's revenue of about $35 billion in the trailing 12-month period is a tiny percentage of that total. If Visa can make headway in its addressable market, the company's revenue, earnings, and stock price should move in the same direction they have during the past 10 years.\nThe company is well-equipped to deliver a CAGR of more than 10.5% through 2030.\nAs of this writing, Novo Nordisk's market cap is about $400 billion. To hit $1 trillion, it would need a CAGR of about 16.5%. That would be an impressive average to maintain for six years, but Novo Nordisk has been more than impressive recently. Brand names like Wegovy and Ozempic have become famous. Both are GLP-1 medicines that treat obesity and diabetes, respectively. Novo Nordisk has been one of the pioneers in the GLP-1 weight loss market, which is now attracting pharmaceutical companies left and right.\nSome analysts estimate that the weight loss drug market will hit $150 billion by the early 2030s -- it was worth just $24 billion last year. And although there will be plenty of challengers, Novo Nordisk's pipeline in this field is second to none. The company's most promising programs include an oral medicine called amycretin, and CagriSema, which some have estimated could generate as much as $20.2 billion in revenue by 2030.\nThat barely scratches the surface of Novo Nordisk's pipeline, though. Semaglutide (the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic) is being tested in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, two areas with high unmet needs. The company is developing several other diabetes and obesity medicines, and a range of treatments for various rare diseases. Novo Nordisk's revenue has grown rapidly during the past five years, as have its stock price and market cap.\nThe drugmaker should earn important approvals during the next few years, which will help it continue generating excellent financial results through the end of the decade. Becoming a trillion-dollar stock by 2030 is well within Novo Nordisk's reach, and it should continue beating the market beyond that.\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Visa wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Anirudha Bhagat ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has been on a remarkable run in 2024, with its stock surging 135.6% year to date (YTD). This impressive rally has placed NVIDIA among the top performers in the semiconductor industry, vastly outperforming both the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry and The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK ETF, which posted gains of 102.2% and 14.4%, respectively.\nAt yesterday\u2019s closing price, NVIDIA\u2019s market capitalization of $2.87 trillion now ranks it as the third most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, just behind tech giants Apple Inc. AAPL and Microsoft Corporation MSFT. Both Apple and Microsoft have delivered positive YTD gains of 17.2% and 11.9%, but NVIDIA has surged well ahead of them, highlighting the company\u2019s strong position in the tech world.\nThe question on many investors' minds is whether it\u2019s too late to buy NVIDIA stock or if there\u2019s more room for growth.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA\u2019s meteoric stock rise is driven by its dominance in the rapidly expanding field of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in generative AI. The anticipation that NVIDIA will benefit immensely from increasing investments in AI has fueled this upward momentum. As enterprises across industries look to modernize their workflows, demand for generative AI applications is projected to soar. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is expected to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.\nThis expected growth in AI will require significant computational power, something that NVIDIA\u2019s high-performance chips are uniquely positioned to provide. The company\u2019s graphic processing units (GPUs) are already a key component in AI models, and as businesses invest in AI, they will need to upgrade their network infrastructure. NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation chips, known for their powerful computing capabilities, are likely to become the go-to choice for enterprises looking to adopt AI.\nNVIDIA\u2019s third-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues are forecasted to reach $32.5 billion, a significant jump from the $18.12 billion reported in the same quarter last year. This rapid revenue growth underscores how crucial NVIDIA\u2019s technology is to the future of AI, making it one of the most important players in the semiconductor industry.\nNVIDIA\u2019s influence isn\u2019t limited to AI alone. The company\u2019s GPUs are making waves in other sectors like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing, helping drive innovation in areas like autonomous vehicles and medical diagnostics. As demand for advanced computing solutions continues to grow, NVIDIA is poised to capitalize on these trends, ensuring sustained growth.\nNVIDIA\u2019s financials have been impressive. In its second-quarter fiscal 2025 report, the company posted a staggering 122% year-over-year increase in revenues, coupled with a 152% rise in non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS). These robust financial results are a testament to NVIDIA\u2019s ability to consistently deliver strong performance, even as it navigates a competitive market.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s fiscal 2025 and 2026 earnings suggests continued growth, reflecting confidence in the company\u2019s ability to sustain its leadership position in sectors like gaming, data centers, automotive and professional visualization.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFinancial stability is another key strength of NVIDIA. As of July 28, 2024, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $34.8 billion, up from $31.44 billion in April 2024. This substantial cash reserve provides NVIDIA with a solid cushion to weather any potential market volatility while allowing it to invest in future growth opportunities.\nDespite NVIDIA\u2019s strong performance, some investors may be concerned about the stock\u2019s valuation. Currently, NVIDIA trades at a one-year forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34.09. While this is higher than the Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s forward P/E multiple of 26.74X, the premium is justified, given NVIDIA\u2019s consistent financial outperformance and immense growth potential in emerging sectors like AI and autonomous vehicles.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestors should also consider that NVIDIA is not just a chipmaker. It\u2019s a leader in developing the infrastructure needed for AI applications, giving it a competitive edge that few can match. As AI continues to reshape industries, NVIDIA\u2019s role in powering these innovations is likely to justify its higher valuation.\nNVIDIA stock may have surged approximately 136% this year, but its growth story is far from over. The company\u2019s dominant position in the AI and semiconductor space, along with its impressive financial performance and expanding market reach, suggests that there is still significant room for future growth. For investors looking to capitalize on the AI revolution and NVIDIA\u2019s strategic leadership, this stock remains a compelling buy.\nNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2, offer the best investment opportunities for investors. NVDA stock appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.

        "Author": "  Krystal Hu ",
        "Text": "By Krystal Hu\n(Reuters) -OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has raised $6.6 billion from investors, which could value the company at $157 billion and cement its position as one of the most valuable private companies in the world.\nThe funding has attracted returning venture capital investors including Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, as well as OpenAI's biggest corporate backer Microsoft, and new participation from Nvidia.\nThe closing of the funds coincides with the company's ongoing restructuring efforts and executive changes, including the abrupt departure of its longtime Chief Technology Officer, Mira Murati, last week.\nAltimeter Capital, Fidelity, SoftBank, and Abu Dhabi's state-backed investment firm MGX also participated in the round.\nOpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told employees on Wednesday that the company will be able to provide liquidity for them through a tender offer to buy back their shares in the company following the funding, although no details and timing have been decided, according to a source. Earlier this year, the company allowed some employees to cash out their shares at a valuation of $86 billion.\nThrive Capital, which committed about $1.2 billion from a combination of its own fund and a special purpose vehicle for smaller investors, negotiated the option to invest another $1 billion next year at the same valuation if the AI firm hits a revenue goal, sources added.\nApple, which was in talks to invest in OpenAI, did not end up joining the funding, sources said, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe funding came in the form of convertible notes, and the conversion to equity hinges on a successful structural change into a for-profit that would no longer be controlled by the non-profit board and the removal of cap on returns for investors.\nThe personnel changes haven't deterred enthusiasm from most investors, who are anticipating significant growth based on the projections by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\nThe company is on pace to generate $3.6 billion in revenue this year on mounting losses of over $5 billion. It projects major revenue jump next year to $11.6 billion, according to sources familiar with the figures.\nInvestors have also secured some protections as OpenAI undergoes the complex corporate restructuring that would grant Altman equity. The talks are still ongoing, and no timeline has been determined yet.\nInvestors have negotiated terms that would allow them to claw back their capital or renegotiate the valuation if the changes are not implemented within two years, sources said.\nOpenAI's meteoric rise in terms of product popularity and valuation has captured the world's imagination. Since the launch of ChatGPT, it has attracted 250 million weekly active users. The company's valuation has also risen from $14 billion in 2021 to $157 billion as it grew revenue from zero to $3.6 billion, far exceeding Altman's own projections at the time.\nThe company has told investors it is still actively pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI), meaning developing AI systems that surpass human intelligence, as it ramps up commercialization and tries to be profitable.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Ken Li and Lisa Shumaker)\n"

        "Title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Come Highly Rated by Wall Street",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a red-hot investment theme for nearly two years, and Nvidia has been one of the most popular ways to play that theme. But the billionaire hedge fund managers below sold shares of Nvidia during the second quarter, and shifted capital toward two other AI stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM).\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors sold 9.2 million shares of Nvidia, slashing his stake by 79%. He also added 1.1 million Amazon shares and 633,897 Taiwan Semiconductor shares. Amazon now ranks as his largest holding excluding options and index funds.\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 96,963 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 1%. He also purchased 702,235 Amazon shares and 1.1 million Taiwan Semiconductor shares, which now rank as his second and third largest positions, respectively.\nOf course, the second quarter ended on June 30, so the trades detailed above occured months ago. However, Amazon and Taiwan Semiconductor still come highly recommended by Wall Street:\nAmong the 65 analysts that follow Amazon, 95% rate the stock a buy and the remaining 5% rate the stock a hold. The median price target of $220 per share implies 18% upside from its current share price of $187.\nAmong the 44 analysts that follow Taiwan Semiconductor, 98% rate the stock a buy and the remaining 2% rate the stock a hold. The median price target of $209 per ADR implies 15% upside from its current price of $181.\nHere's what investors should know about Amazon and Taiwan Semiconductor.\nAmazon operates the world's most popular online marketplace in terms of monthly visitors, and the company has fortified its leadership with a robust logistics network. Dominance in retail has helped Amazon become the third-largest ad tech company in the United States, and it could surpass second-place Meta Platforms by the end of the decade, according to eMarketer.\nBeyond retail and advertising, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the market leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services, which puts the company in a unique position where artificial intelligence (AI) is concerned. With the largest community of customers and partners among public clouds, AWS has more monetization and upsell opportunities than its rivals. And consultancy Gartner recently recognized AWS as a leader in cloud AI developer services.\nAmazon reported mixed financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 10% to $148 billion, narrowly missing estimates. But GAAP net income increased 94% to $1.26 per share, beating expectations. The stock declined following the report, partly because sales increased more slowly than anticipated, and partly because management gave somewhat conservative guidance for the third quarter.\nHowever, Amazon has a strong presence in three larger markets, and Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 44 times earnings look relatively reasonable. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 2, which is a discount to the three-year average of 2.9. Patient investors should consider buying a few shares today.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the world's largest dedicated chipmaker or foundry. It shoulders the cost burden associated with fabricating chips for other companies. TSMC accounted for 62% of foundry revenue in the June quarter, up 4 percentage points from the previous year, according to Counterpoint Research.\nThat scale affords the company a significant advantage. It supports the aggressive capital expenditures required to keep TSMC on the cutting edge of semiconductor manufacturing, also called process technology. Heavy R&D spending, coupled with engineering expertise, enables the company to consistently build chips that are smaller, faster, and more power efficient.\nTSMC holds more than 90% market share in its most advanced process technologies, the 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer nodes, according to analysts. And management says its 2-nanometer node will reach volume production in 2025. Industry leadership affords TSMC pricing power, and it has made the company the AI chipmaker of choice for customers like Apple, Broadcom, and Nvidia.\nTSMC reported strong financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $20.8 billion and earnings jumped 30% to $1.48 per ADR. \"Our business in the second quarter was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by continued smartphone seasonality,\" said CFO Wendell Huang. He anticipates strong demand for smartphone and AI products in the third quarter.\nWall Street expects TSMC's earnings to increase at 26% annually over the next three years as the AI boom drives demand for faster semiconductors. That makes the current valuation of 32.4 times earnings look fair. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.2, which is a discount to the three-year average of 1.6. Investors should feel comfortable buying a few shares today. TSCM stock doubled the gains in the S&P 500 during the last three years, and I think it will continue to outperform over the next three.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio.\nRay Dalio was born in 1949 and graduated from Long Island University in 1971. After a brief stint as a clerk on the New York Stock Exchange, he attended Harvard Business School and earned his MBA in 1973. That same year, he became the Director of Commodities at Dominick & Dominick LLC and later traded futures at Shearson Hayden Stone for a year. Dalio founded\u00a0Bridgewater Associates\u00a0in 1973 in his apartment. In July 2011, he stepped down as CEO but continued to work as a co-CIO alongside Robert Prince and Greg Jensen, taking on the title of \u201cMentor.\u201d\nBridgewater Associates is notable for its focus on transparency and accountability. The firm promotes a culture where team members take responsibility for mistakes and learn from them. It encourages questioning and alignment, ensuring everyone regularly evaluates the validity of their ideas. This approach is crucial to the firm\u2019s management style and investment strategies.\nRay Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, emphasized that since 1945, the United States has been the dominant global empire, but it is now in a state of relative decline. This decline isn\u2019t just an opinion, it\u2019s supported by concrete measures such as the nation\u2019s share of global GDP, military strength, and the quality of its education system. These factors indicate that the U.S. is losing its position.\nIn addition to these, Dalio points out two other key elements that often disrupt world order: natural events like droughts, floods, and pandemics, which have historically caused more damage and upheaval than wars, and human creativity and technological innovation, which bring about substantial changes. Dalio believes all five factors are influencing the U.S. today. However, he stresses that the most critical issue is how people manage these challenges together.\nThe ability to address them intelligently and without creating further conflict is essential. If conflict arises, it could lead to a devastating outcome. But if people can come together and handle the situation effectively, the country can navigate these issues successfully. For Dalio, how society deals with one another is the number one factor in determining the future.\nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Ray Dalio also highlighted significant issues in China that have emerged over the past four years. He explained that China is in need of a major restructuring, as a large portion of individual spending, around 70%, was invested in real estate. With the decline in real estate, stocks, and salaries, people have become more cautious, reducing their spending and holding onto cash. In a deflationary environment, cash has become a relatively safe asset. This situation is affecting both households and businesses.\nDalio also pointed out that the government sector is facing serious challenges. Local governments, responsible for 83% of public spending, previously relied on land sales to generate revenue. With land sales drying up, these governments have accumulated significant debt, and now they\u2019re struggling to pay it off. The key question is how to inject money into these local economies to keep them functioning. Dalio compared the situation to Japan\u2019s struggles in 1990, noting that China\u2019s challenges are even more severe and will require deep restructuring to resolve.\nIn addition to economic concerns, Dalio raised questions about property ownership and values. He referenced Deng Xiaoping\u2019s famous statement, \u201cIt\u2019s glorious to be rich,\u201d and wondered if that sentiment still holds true in China today. The overall environment in the country is becoming more complex and difficult, as these economic and political issues intensify.\nDalio also emphasized the importance of being cautious when investing in China. He made it clear that every country goes through economic cycles, experiencing both highs and lows. According to Dalio, it\u2019s crucial not to invest too heavily in any one country, including China, to avoid having it dominate your portfolio. Despite the challenges China faces, Dalio continues to invest there, but he stressed that the key consideration is the size and structure of the investment. Overall, his experience investing in China has been positive, though careful management is essential.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates\u2019 Q2 2024 13F portfolio and picked the top 10 stocks held by the fund.

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been an absolutely incredible performer recently. Since the start of 2023, it rose by more than 800%. Most investors would be thrilled to own a stock that delivered returns like that, but not every company has the potential. It requires a massive growth catalyst to justify such gains.\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) is one company that could have this potential. It's a key player in one niche of the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, and has a massive backlog for its products.\nSoundHound AI's technology can parse human speech and perform various tasks based on what it hears. Among the ways it's already being used most are in processing restaurant orders and improving digital assistants in vehicles, but its capabilities extend far beyond those two use cases.\nIn the automotive segment, SoundHound partnered with Stellantis; the giant automaker will integrate SoundHound's tech into its vehicles across Europe and Japan. This will give people access to generative AI functions while they're driving -- an improvement from the voice assistants that are available on vehicles today. If SoundHound can win business with other automakers and break into other regions, this segment of its business alone could provide it with a huge amount of growth.\nSoundHound also worked with several companies in the restaurant sector to automate telephone and drive-thru orders, which saves restaurants on wages. According to the company, these AI assistants actually outperform humans in terms of order speed and accuracy, so the customer doesn't feel like the experience declined. Some of SoundHound's restaurant customers, among them White Castle and Jersey Mike's, are fairly big, but there's serious room for it to grow if it can capture some of the largest fast-food businesses.\nSoundHound AI could achieve even greater success if its solutions are utilized in new applications.\nBut is that potential enough to make its stock the next Nvidia?\nIn the second quarter, SoundHound generated $13.5 million in revenue, which was up 54% year over year. That's quite small compared to other AI businesses.\nHowever, the key figure investors should focus on is SoundHound's backlog, which totals $723 million. This figure doubled from a year ago, showing that rising demand has outpaced SoundHound's capability to integrate its product with its customers' systems.\nThis is factoring into SoundHound's current valuation, as Wall Street has high hopes for the company.\nTrading at 23 times sales, SoundHound stock already carries a premium valuation. By contrast, Nvidia traded for around 15 times forward earnings at the start of 2023. That was a dirt-cheap price, and also a far cry from the forward earnings ratio of 47 it trades at today.\nSoundHound already has a premium price tag, which detracts from its growth potential from here. But if it can mature into a business that generates $100 million in revenue per quarter, Nvidia-like performance for the stock is still possible.\nIf SoundHound achieved that and carried a valuation of 20 times sales, it would be worth $8 billion, up 370% from its market cap today. That would be a solid return, but still far less than what Nvidia produced.\nSoundHound stock's premium price tag may prevent it from delivering Nvidia-like returns from here, but that doesn't mean it won't be a great investment. However, it's a bit of a long shot considering the niche use cases for its product and the company's small size.\u00a0It could make investors some serious money, but don't expect Nvidia-like returns.\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

To overtake Apple as the world's largest company, Nvidia's stock needs to rise around 8% while Apple's stock stays flat.\nIs this feasible? After all, Apple's revenue over the last 12 months totals $385 billion, while Nvidia's is a comparatively smaller $96 billion.\nThe current state of these two businesses couldn't be more different.\nApple's consumer products are quite popular in the U.S. and overseas. However, it struggled to turn this popularity into any sort of revenue growth recently, as its most popular device, the iPhone, failed to grow sales meaningfully over the past three years.\nYear\nQ3 iPhone Sales\n2024\n$39.3 billion\n2023\n$39.7 billion\n2022\n$40.7 billion\n2021\n$39.6 billion\nData source: Apple. Note: Apple's Q3 ends around June 30 each year.\nThe big hope was that this year's iPhone 16 launch would trigger an upgrade wave thanks to its ability to run Apple's take on artificial intelligence (AI), Apple Intelligence. Unfortunately for Apple, many reports suggest the demand for the iPhone 16 hasn't been great, affecting a potential business catalyst.\nNvidia isn't having that same problem. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering the AI revolution thanks to being best-in-class. The biggest AI companies are buying these GPUs by the thousands, which is massively benefiting Nvidia. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 (ending July 28), Nvidia's revenue rose 122% year over year. That strength is also expected to continue next quarter, with management guiding for $32.5 billion in revenue, or about 80% year over year growth.\nNvidia is also expected see revenue growth at least through next year, as many companies are still building out their AI computing infrastructure. To add to Nvidia's growth potential, it's releasing its Blackwell architecture, unlocking massive speed gains compared to its current Hopper architecture.\nWall Street analysts believe Nvidia's revenue will grow around 42% next year, far outpacing Apple's projections of 8% growth.\nStill, that growth won't be enough to catch Apple in terms of revenue. So, how could a company that generates far less revenue overtake another as the world's largest company?\nRevenue isn't everything when assessing a company. What matters more are profits and valuation. If the only thing that mattered was revenue, then Walmart would be valued as the world's largest company, as it generated $665 billion in revenue over the past year compared to Apple's $385 billion.\nWhen profits are considered, Nvidia starts to move a bit closer to Apple.\nWhile Nvidia is rapidly closing the gap, it still generates about half the profits of Apple. But with its growth pace and stronger profit margin (55% compared to 26% for Apple), Nvidia could quickly catch Apple's profit levels.\nBy the end of the next fiscal year for each company (Apple's ends around the end of September while Nvidia's ends in January), if each business maintains its current profit margin, Apple will generate about $110 billion in profits, while Nvidia would be slightly below at $98 billion.\nThat's a huge gap to close in just a year's time, but if Nvidia's business grows the way analysts think it can, it will be right there with Apple.\nNext comes valuation. Investors usually give companies premiums if they are growing at a faster pace or have a strong brand. Nvidia has both of these things, which is why its valuation is so high. On the other hand, Apple has a strong brand but slower growth. If Nvidia is expected to keep its revenue growth going through 2026, it will likely fetch a higher premium than Apple, which would probably propel it to overtake Apple as the world's largest company.\nNvidia has a lot going for it, and its financial picture will change substantially over the next year. I think this could be enough to surpass Apple as the world's largest company, as Apple has some growth issues it needs to address.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) represent two different ways to invest in the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market. Nvidia is the world's leading producer of high-end GPUs, which are used to process complex AI tasks in data centers. Broadcom's chipmaking business sells the networking and optical chips for transferring all of that data.\nOver the past three years, Nvidia's stock soared about 510% as Broadcom's stock advanced more than 260%. The benchmark PHLX Semiconductor Sector index only rallied roughly 60% during the same period. Let's see why these two hot chipmakers outperformed their industry peers -- and which stock is the better buy right now.\nNvidia once generated most of its revenue from gaming GPUs for PCs. However, the rapid expansion of the AI market turned its data center business into its largest and fastest-growing business. It generated 87% of its revenue from its data center chips in its latest quarter, and that segment should remain its core growth engine. All of the world's top AI software companies -- including OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet's Google -- run their services on Nvidia's chips.\nNvidia is clearly the top vendor of picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, and the market's demand is consistently outstripping its available supply. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027), analysts expect its revenue to grow at a stunning compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 56%.\nTrading at 34 times next year's earnings, Nvidia's stock still looks reasonably valued relative to its growth potential. But investors shouldn't overlook the potential macro, competitive, and regulatory challenges. An economic downturn drives many companies to rein in their purchases of Nvidia's pricey data center GPUs. As for the competition, Advanced Micro Devices could creep up on Nvidia with its cheaper data center GPUs, and most of Nvidia's largest customers have already been developing their own AI accelerators. Tighter trade restrictions on advanced AI chips could also reduce its sales in China to a trickle. Nvidia is a great investment if you believe the AI market will keep expanding. But if you think it's a bubble on the verge of popping, it might be a risky play.\nBroadcom, which was known as Avago before it acquired the original Broadcom and inherited its brand in 2016, operates two main businesses. Its semiconductor business sells chips for the mobile, wireless, networking, data storage, and industrial markets. Its infrastructure software business -- which it expanded with its acquisitions of CA Technologies, Symantec's enterprise security division, and VMware -- provides on-premise and cloud-based software for large companies.\nIn its latest quarter, Broadcom generated 56% of its revenue from its semiconductor business and the remaining 44% from its infrastructure software business. For fiscal 2024 (which ends this October), the company expects its sales of AI-oriented chips to roughly triple to $12 billion, or nearly a quarter of its projected revenue for the full year. It expects that rapid growth to offset its slower sales of non-AI chips and infrastructure software.\nThose slower-growth businesses should also warm up again as the macroeconomic environment improves. That diversification makes Broadcom a more balanced tech company that isn't as tightly tethered to the AI market as Nvidia.\nBut it's also growing at a slower rate. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue to rise at a CAGR of 24% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 18%. It also trades at 44 times next year's earnings, which makes it seem a bit pricier than Nvidia. On an adjusted basis (which excludes its acquisition-related expenses), it looks more reasonably valued at 29 times forward earnings. Broadcom's forward dividend yield of 1.2% is also a lot higher than Nvidia's paltry forward yield of 0.03%.\nNvidia and Broadcom are both great long-term investments. But if you want to fully profit from the secular expansion of the AI market, Nvidia is the more obvious play. It will remain the top provider of AI accelerator chips for the foreseeable future, it has incredible pricing power, and its stock doesn't seem overvalued yet.\nBroadcom is a more balanced and diversified play on the semiconductor and software markets, but a lot of its recent growth has been driven by its massive acquisitions. It's made a lot of smart investments so far, but it could eventually \"di-worsify\" its business and take on too much debt with that ambitious inorganic expansion. So if you want a simpler way to invest in the AI market, it's still smarter to buy Nvidia instead of Broadcom.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Title": "Think Nvidia Stock Is Expensive? These 3 Members of the S&P 500 Trade at Even Higher Valuations.",
        "Author": "  Jon Quast, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock overvalued? This question, while simple on the surface, is extraordinarily hard to answer.\nMany investors use a valuation metric called a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This popular metric is useful because it measures the stock price against a company's profits. And in Nvidia's case, its P/E ratio of 57 certainly looks expensive, considering it's roughly double the P/E ratio for the S&P 500.\nThen again, context is important. Nvidia stock might look expensive now. But it actually trades at a steep discount to its average P/E ratio valuation over the last five years, as the chart below shows.\nMany say to avoid stocks with a high P/E ratio. But Nvidia's high P/E over the last five years didn't prevent the stock from rising over 2,700%.\nNvidia stock is now cheaper than its five-year average valuation. Moreover, it's not even the most expensive constituent of the S&P 500. In fact, Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ: AXON) and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) trade at higher P/E ratios, as of this writing. And even Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) has been more expensive than Nvidia at times in recent weeks.\nAxon provides hardware and software to law enforcement agencies. CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity specialist. And Costco is a grocery and home-goods retail chain known for its membership-business model and low prices. As the chart below shows, none of these companies are necessarily cheap when looking at the P/E ratio.\nShould investors sell stocks when their valuations are high? Should they only buy stocks that trade with below-average valuations?\nIf the path to long-term wealth were this simple, all investors would be rich. The entire investing process could be automated to sell when a P/E ratio was high and buy when a P/E ratio was low. But it's not that simple. As I said at the start, it's extraordinarily hard to say when a stock is actually overvalued.\nFamous investor Bill Miller succinctly explains why valuing a stock is difficult. Miller has said, \"100% of the information you have about a company represents the past, and 100% of the value depends on the future.\"\nImagine for a moment a company valued at $10 billion and that has only made $1 million in profit. That stock would look extremely overvalued using the information we have from the past. But Miller reminds us that value has to do with the future. If this same $10 billion company earns $100 billion in profit over the next five years or so, then the stock is a screaming value stock.\nIn my opinion, whether Nvidia is overvalued or undervalued today largely depends on how sustainable its profit margins are. As the chart below shows, its margin has soared as artificial intelligence has fueled demand for its hardware products.\nI believe it's reasonable to expect more growth from Nvidia in coming years. And if the company can defend its current profit margins, then the stock likely has more upside. But if its margins drop back down to more normalized levels, the stock might not fare as well. That's a question that every Nvidia investor needs to answer.\nBut what about the other three companies that are as expensive or more expensive than Nvidia when looking at the P/E ratios? Well, here's how I think about their valuations.\nCostco is a fantastic business, enjoying stability from 137 million membership card holders with a greater-than 90% renewal rate. But one thing it's not is high growth. It only had 5% top-line growth in its fiscal 2024, which ended Sept. 1. This led to 14% growth for operating income, which is respectable. But investors shouldn't expect these growth metrics to materially improve in its fiscal 2025.\nThat's why I'm not a fan of the valuation of Costco stock today. Its valuation implies better-than-average long-term growth with the business whereas it's more likely to be modest.\nTurning to Axon, its growth is far superior to Costco, and it should stay robust for quite some time. The company has a competitive advantage because it sells its hardware in a package with its cloud-software services. Agencies are eager to renew their contracts with Axon because they don't want to find a new solution for all their data. And there are still plenty of places that aren't using Axon yet that could in the future.\nHowever, I still think there's room for caution with Axon stock today. Its growth rate has been higher at times in the past. But by contrast, its price-to-sales valuation is almost double its 10-year average.\nCrowdStrike stock is by no means the cheapest stock on this list when using various valuation metrics. But once again, value is about the future. And CrowdStrike's potential is still so large because of its market. Management projects that the market for its security platform will skyrocket from $100 billion in 2024 to $225 billion in 2028.\nFor perspective, CrowdStrike only has $3.5 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. In other words, it doesn't even need to grab a significant portion of this market to have significant growth. Moreover, it has an easy path to growth. Only 29% of its customers use seven or more of its software products, whereas it has more than 20 options to chose from.\nCross-selling to existing customers is an easy path for growth for CrowdStrike. And what's stunning is that its pipeline for new deals has completely recovered from its catastrophe earlier this year when a software defect caused a massive IT outage. The speed of its rebound strongly implies that its customers love its cybersecurity platform and products.\nCrowdStrike stock is quite expensive when looking at the valuation metrics that measure its past results. But when considering its path for future growth, I believe the stock could still be a good value today and perhaps the best value of the four stocks mentioned here.\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

Here\u2019s everything to know\nWhen Hurricane Helene hit, this disaster-proof Florida neighborhood kept the lights on\nWhat kind of music makes you most productive at work? Here\u2019s what the science says\nCerebras is a competitor to companies such as Nvidia, and given the massive demand among investors for chipmaker stocks, the company appears primed to start issuing shares in the near future, having applied to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol CBRS. No listing date has been announced yet, but a source familiar with the plans said the company is aiming for later this month.\nAn IPO from Cerebras could also help kick-start a still-sluggish market for U.S. listings, which have seen a significant slowdown following a flurry of activity during and after the pandemic a few years ago.\nPotential investors may want to take note that Cerebras is still operating in the red. According to its S-1 filing, the company saw a net loss of nearly $67 million during the first half of 2024, with roughly $136 million in sales. It also saw net losses of $127.2 million and $177.7 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe numbers do appear to be trending in the right direction, however, as the filing notes that the losses from the first half of 2024 represent a year-over-year \u201creduction of 14%.\u201d\nAs for what the IPO could ultimately net the company, Renaissance Capital estimates that a Cerebras IPO could generate $800 million.\nOverall, the IPO market has been slow, though data from EY shows that the recently concluded third quarter of 2024 did see an uptick over the second quarter.\nGlobally, there were 310 IPOs during the third quarter this year, netting nearly $25 billion in proceeds. For comparison, during the third quarter of 2022, there were 371 IPOs, with more than $52 billion in proceeds.\nEY, in a brief, also notes that AI enthusiasm is shining through in the IPO data. \u201cApproximately 50 AI companies are currently in IPO registration; about one-third are profitable. This trend reflects sustained investor interest in AI-driven innovations, despite challenges around profitability,\u201d it reads.\nFurther, a recent interest rate cut by the Fed\u2014and the prospect of more cuts ahead\u2014could also help fuel more IPO activity. But there are still a lot of factors at play that could keep investors on the sidelines for now, says Mark Schwartz, EY Americas IPO and SPAC advisory leader.\n\u201cDespite largely favorable market conditions following a mid-summer dip in confidence of sorts, issuers are approaching the rest of this year cautiously in light of the election and geopolitical concerns,\u201d Schwartz said in a statement to Fast Company. \u201cBut, as we get clarity on the political scene and the interest rate environment, there is growing conviction that a stronger IPO market will emerge next year.\u201d\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.comSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http://fastcompany.com/newsletters\n"

        "Title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock? Wall Street's Answer May Surprise Investors",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares rocketed 745% during the 18-month period that ended on June 30, 2024, as enthusiasm about artificial intelligence (AI) swept the market. But shares have declined 5% since that halfway point, leaving some investors to wonder whether the window of opportunity has closed.\nWall Street has a clear answer: No, it's not too late to buy Nvidia. Of the 64 analysts that follow the company, 94% rate the stock a buy and 6% rate the stock a hold. Not a single analyst recommends selling at the present time. Additionally, Nvidia has a median 12-month price target of $150 per share, implying 28% upside from its current share price of $117.\nBeyond that, some analysts expect colossal gains. In June, Beth Kendig at the I/O Fund estimated Nvidia would be worth $10 trillion by 2030. That implies 250% upside from its current market value of $2.8 trillion. In September, Phil Panaro at Boston Consulting Group predicted that Nvidia would be an $800 stock by 2030. That implies about 585% upside.\nInvestors may find that surprising given that Nvidia is already one of the largest companies in the world. But AI could be the investment opportunity of a lifetime, and Nvidia is arguably the most important company to the AI economy. Here's what investors should know.\nNvidia builds the most coveted graphics processing units (GPUs) in the computing industry. GPUs are chips that perform technical calculations more quickly and efficiently than central processing units (CPUs), which lets them accelerate complex workloads like training large language models and running artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\nNvidia accounted for 98% of data center GPU shipments last year, and its market share in AI chips exceeds 80%, according to analysts. One reason the company has achieved such a dominant position is the superior performance of its hardware. Nvidia chips consistently outstrip products from competitors at the MLPerf benchmarks, objective tests that evaluate AI systems across training and inference tasks.\nAnother reason Nvidia has achieved such a dominant market position is its CUDA software ecosystem. CUDA comprises hundreds of software libraries that simplify the development of GPU-accelerated applications. No other chipmaker offers anything close to CUDA, so Nvidia GPUs have emerged as the gold standard in data center accelerators.\nNvidia has cemented its dominance in the data center by expanding into adjacent verticals. For instance, the company leads the market in networking equipment used for generative AI, and it recently introduced its first server CPU. Nvidia also offers subscription software and cloud services that support the development of AI applications across a broad range of domains, from recommender systems in retail to computer vision in healthcare.\nIn short, Nvidia has a durable competitive advantage where AI is concerned not only because its chip are the fastest, but also because it participates in so many parts of the AI economy. To quote Zoe Thomas of The Wall Street Journal, \"Nvidia already dominates the market for chips powering the artificial intelligence boom. Now the company is playing a growing role in designing AI data centers.\"\nGrand View Research estimates the AI accelerator market will increase at 29% annually through 2030, while spending across AI hardware, software, and services compounds at 36% annually during the same period. That bodes well for Nvidia and its shareholders.\nIn May, Toshiya Hari at Goldman Sachs wrote, \"We believe Nvidia will remain the de facto industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive advantage that spans its hardware and software capabilities, as well as the installed base and ecosystem it has built over multiple decades, and the pace at which it is and will be innovating over the next several years.\"\nBut he's not the only Wall Street analyst to lavish Nvidia with praise. Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities has called the company the \"foundation of the AI revolution.\" And Angelo Zino at CFRA believes Nvidia \"will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade as the world becomes more AI-driven.\"\nWith that in mind, Wall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to grow at 49% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends January 2026). That consensus makes the current valuation of 53 times adjusted earnings look quite reasonable. Patient investors can comfortably buy a small position today, and they should consider adding to the position in the event of a pullback.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Ryan Vanzo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "From the beginning of 2019 to the end of 2020, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) more than tripled its market capitalization. Three years later, the value of the company tripled again. And in just the past 12 months, Nvidia stock is on the verge of tripling its market cap once again. Already one of the largest companies in the world with a $3.2 trillion market cap, is it possible Nvidia extends its streak to surpass $10 trillion over the next five years?\nNvidia ended 2019 with a market cap of $144 billion. At the time, nearly half of its revenue stemmed from chips designed for the video game market, while the data center segment accounted for about 30%. But as of the most recent quarter, 87% of the top line comes from the data center and AI segment. This is undoubtedly the category that will most influence the future of the business.\nPart of the reason AI chips now dominate the company's top line is the sheer growth of the industry. In 2024, Gartner expects demand for AI chips to rise 33%. Over the next five years, average annual growth is expected to top 20%. Right now, Nvidia has a stranglehold on the market with an estimated 88% share of GPU spending. Data from Jon Peddie Research suggests Nvidia's market share has only continued to grow over the last 12 months.\nEven if Nvidia's market share pulls back in the face of competitive pressure over the next few years, the underlying market growth can still fuel strong results for the company. AI is on its way to becoming the biggest new trend in a generation, and there will be plenty of industry spending to go around. Wall Street analysts are forecasting 52.5% annual sales growth for Nvidia over the next five years, which is only a small decrease from the 57.2% compound annual growth it's delivered in the previous five years.\nWhen Nvidia had a $144 billion market cap five years ago, shares were valued at 15 times sales. As a $3.2 trillion company as of this writing, Nvidia's price-to-sales valuation has climbed to 34 (down from its peak at 46). Based on that year-end 2019 multiple, Nvidia would be worth $1.4 trillion today. While that's still impressive, it's a stark reminder to investors that Nvidia's value has surged thanks to multiple expansion as well as its underlying sales growth.\nBecause Nvidia is growing so quickly, though, one could argue its premium valuation is justified. And if the company lives up to analysts' expectations for 52.5% annual revenue growth going forward, Nvidia will report a whopping $794 billion of revenue by 2029. At that level, the company would need a price-to-sales multiple of about 12.5 to bring its market cap to $10 trillion.\nThere are zero guarantees this incredibly bullish scenario will come to pass, but if analysts' growth forecasts for Nvidia are even close to accurate, the company could indeed approach the $10 trillion milestone.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

This new AI processor presented at Computex 2024 in Taipei should threaten Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which could positively influence competition and change prices for AI chips.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMD.\nExpected to go into production before the end of 2024, the MI325X is one of several products that AMD is releasing in an effort to take advantage of what is being predicted to become the $500 billion artificial intelligence chip market by 2028. Since OpenAI's ChatGPT requires massive amounts of GPU usage, AMD aims to target Nvidia, which controls over 90% of the data center AI chip market.\nWhile AMD has always been a second fiddle in this segment, the company's chief executive, Lisa Su, recently underscored the increasing call for AI and the company's resolve to improve its spend on AI chip designing. This is part of the new product release plan that AMD has been fixing to bring out new chips every year the next ones are the MI350 in 2025 and the MI400 in 2026.\nAMD also wants to capture AI developers for whom Nvidia's CUDA programming language is most popular by improving its own ROCm software to make it easier to transition to AMD's accelerators. This could expand the options for developers who might work using elements connected with the content creation and predictive modeling.\nWhile AMD's stock fell by 4 % after the announcement.

        "Title": "Could Nvidia Stock Soar If Donald Trump Wins in November?",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Government policies matter for companies. This is especially true for a global technology powerhouse like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nThe two major presidential candidates, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump, have very different policy proposals. The next occupant of the Oval Office could make a difference in how well Nvidia's business and stock performs over the next four years. Could Nvidia stock soar if Trump wins in November?\nThere are many ways that policies implemented in a second Trump administration could impact Nvidia. Let's look at four of Trump's proposals that could be especially relevant.\nFirst, the former President wants to extend the corporate tax cuts implemented during his first term that are set to expire in 2025. Those tax cuts lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Trump has also proposed further reducing the corporate tax rate to 15%.\nSecond, Trump strongly favors implementing steep tariffs on imported products. He said in September, \"Tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented.\" The GOP presidential nominee wants to impose a 60% tariff on all imports from China and a tariff of up to 20% on imports from other countries. In addition, Trump has called for even higher tariffs in specific cases, including threatening a 100% tariff on products made in Mexico.\nThird, Trump pledges to push hard to reduce government regulations on businesses. He said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York on Sept. 5, 2024, that he intends to eliminate ten existing rules for every one rule added.\nFourth, the Republican National Committee's platform (which was crafted by the Trump team) stated that the Executive Order about artificial intelligence (AI) signed by President Biden would be repealed. The purpose of this Executive Order was to address the safety and security of AI technology. The RNC argued that the Executive Order is \"dangerous\" and \"hinders AI innovation.\"\nCorporate tax cuts could boost Nvidia's earnings, but perhaps not as much as you might think. In the first half of 2024, Nvidia paid income taxes of $5.01 billion -- only 8.9% of revenue. In 2023, the company's tax bill was $4.06 billion (6.7% of revenue). Both levels are already well below the 15% corporate tax rate proposed by Trump.\nThe former President's proposed tariffs could hurt Nvidia. Much of the company's manufacturing is currently done outside the U.S., including some in China. Nvidia would likely try to pass higher costs resulting from the tariffs on to its customers.\nMany economists believe that the tariffs could cause inflation to spike. If the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to fight rising inflation, it could negatively impact some customers' spending on Nvidia's chips.\nThe Biden Administration's regulations limiting exports of AI chips to China have put a damper on Nvidia's business to some extent. Although Trump hasn't indicated if he would lift these regulations, his general stance toward China seems to make it likely that he would not.\nNvidia said in its 2023 annual filing that compliance with other regulations hasn't had a material effect on its operations. Further deregulation in a second Trump Administration, therefore, probably wouldn't move the needle much for the company or its stock.\nHowever, a repeal of Biden's Executive Order related to AI by Trump could help Nvidia. In particular, it could cause tech companies to invest more heavily in developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), an area that has raised safety concerns.\nWith all this in mind, let's return to the initial question: Could Nvidia stock soar if Trump wins in November? The answer is... of course, it could. After all, the stock jumped more than 5x during Trump's first term.\nAs we've seen, though, not all of the former President's proposals are beneficial to Nvidia. There's no guarantee that its stock would flourish in a second Trump Administration.\nNvidia's share price may rise significantly regardless of which party holds the White House. The stock skyrocketed more than 14x during the eight years Barack Obama was president. It's up nearly 9x since Biden took office. What matters more than government policies for Nvidia is the demand for its chips. And that demand seems likely to increase whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump is the next U.S. President.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best High Growth NASDAQ Stock That is Profitable in 2024?",
        "Author": "  Talha Qureshi ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable in 2024. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable.\nMalcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, joined CNBC to talk about where the market could go and his sentiment regarding the AI and overall tech sector. While many analysts believe that it will be the small caps that will lead the growth with interest rates easing and the economy slowing down. We recently covered the\u00a08 Most Undervalued Penny Stocks To Buy According To Analysts, where we talked about how Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors likes the small cap in the current market environment. Here\u2019s a piece from the article:\n\u201cTo talk about what the stock market looks like today and in the near future. Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors joined CNBC in a recent interview. He has been one of the strong proponents and supporters of small-cap stocks. Lee says that we are in a volatile environment currently, due to a few reasons, one being the elections in less than 30 days, the second being the Middle Eastern crisis which is scaring investors, and lastly the port strike that has the potential to cripple the economy. However, he still expressed his optimism that the year-end has a lot of tailwinds and investors shouldn\u2019t be afraid to buy the dip. Moreover, Lee also highlighted that these current events are all short-term headwinds in a buying cycle and are expected to die down quickly.\nEthridge thinks otherwise, he believes that mega-cap stocks will continue to lead market growth, although not at the same pace as in recent years but still at a steady pace. He attributes this to the ongoing influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on various sectors, including real estate and manufacturing, which are becoming increasingly vital due to rising demands on infrastructure.\nMoreover, while explaining why the mega caps will lead the growth, Ethridge pointed out that for the big tech stocks, Fed rate cuts were not necessary as they had significant cash on their balance sheets to reinvest into newer AI ventures. We have already seen Magnificent Seven invest heavily in AI despite the high rate of borrowing thereby leading the bull market in difficult times.\nThe rate cuts have now made it easy for other companies that didn\u2019t have enough cash to borrow and invest in technology. However, he also pointed out that the pace of rate cuts might slow down moving forward, thereby making it hard for small caps to keep up the technology investment race. Ethridge suggests that investors may need to adjust their expectations regarding future Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nMoreover, we are also entering earnings season, will the earnings derail the momentum or continue to boost the market? Drew Pettit, Citi Research Director of US Equity Strategy joined CNBC in another interview. He thinks that we are in for a decent quarter, although we are in an expensive market.\nWhile talking about how various sectors will perform, Pettit mentioned that software has the highest bar within tech, meaning its growth expectations are high, yet many software companies are not monetizing effectively. This creates volatility in stock performance. As earnings reports come in, Pettit suggests investors should focus on consumer behavior and credit conditions, particularly in the banking sector, which is expected to perform well this quarter. He also encouraged investors to look beyond the recent quarter earnings into 2025 and 2026, while choosing companies to invest in.\nOur Methodology\nTo curate the list of 10 high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable in 2024 we used the Finviz stock screener, Seeking Alpha, and Yahoo Finance as our sources. Using the stock screener, we got an initial list of major NASDAQ stocks sorted by their market capitalization. Next, we sourced the 5-year net income growth and revenue growth rates for these stocks from Seeking Alpha and the GAAP trailing twelve-month net income from Yahoo Finance. We only selected stocks that had 5-year net income and revenue growth of more than 15%. Lastly, we ranked the stocks by the number of hedge fund holders in Q2 2024 from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n5-Year Net Income Growth: 80.81%\n5-Year Revenue Growth: 56.73%\nTTM Net Income: $53.01 Billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading technology company which a huge market capitalization of $3.307 trillion as of this writing. It engages in some of the most high growth industries within the greater technology sector namely, Data Centers, Automotive Solutions, Networking, and Gaming. They provide Gaming Processing Units (GPUs) and semiconductor chips for computing infrastructure, which have become the powerhouse for Data Centers and AI revolution.\nThe company tripled its market capitalization from 2019 to 2022, a time when most of its revenue came from GPUs business and Data Centers accounted for merely 30% of the revenue. However, things have changed, the second quarter of fiscal 2025 revealed Data Center segment now accounts for more than 87% of the revenue. And what\u2019s more impressive is the fact that this segment is reaching record highs. During the most recent quarter Data Center revenue was up 154% year-over-year to reach $26.3 billion, mainly on the back of NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Hopper GPUs.\nThe company also announced that its Blackwell platform GPUs production is scheduled to begin in Q4 and that management expects several billions in revenue from Blackwell in Q4. Recently in its October investor presentation the company announced that the Blackwell platform is already in full production phase, indicating that the revenue boost for the company might come sooner than expected. As per the management Blackwell utilizes 4 times less power when compared to Hopper GPUs, which is likely to cater the high power consumption issue associated with the Data Centers.\nWhile the Data Center segment hit record high, the Gaming segment revenue also improved 16% year-over-year to $2.9 billion. Strong performance by these two segments resulted in the net income for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) going up by more than 168% during the same time making it one of the high growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable in 2024.\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cOver the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\u201d\nOverall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Intel\u2019s years of missteps leave it fighting for survival in the Nvidia-dominated AI era",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Kahn ",
        "Text": "Henry V had Agincourt. Gen. Robert E. Lee had Gettysburg. And Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has Chandler. That would be Chandler, Ariz., outside Phoenix, where Intel is investing nearly $30 billion to build two state-of-the-art semiconductor plants, or fabs, that will be the first to use the company\u2019s newest chipmaking process. It\u2019s here, in Chandler, where Gelsinger\u2019s fate\u2014and likely that of the company he leads\u2014will be decided.\nGelsinger, who was named CEO in 2021, has essentially bet the company on 18A, a new chipmaking process. He hopes it will position Intel as a viable alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world\u2019s leading contract manufacturer of chips.\nThe reason for Intel\u2019s struggles is clear: It fell victim to a classic innovator\u2019s dilemma\u2014not once but twice. First, early in the 21st century, its preoccupation with producing chips for PCs and data centers led it to miss the smartphone revolution. Then, in the past decade, it missed the emergence of chips designed for artificial intelligence.\nIntel rival Nvidia took a type of chip originally designed for the demands of video games, the graphics processing unit (or GPU), and turned it into the workhorse for training and running AI models. Now the generative-AI boom has made Nvidia one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, worth more than $3 trillion, compared with Intel\u2019s relatively paltry $84 billion.\nGelsinger is racing to reverse Intel\u2019s slide by repositioning the company around manufacturing excellence, while also trying to establish Intel as a player in the market for AI chips. Many are skeptical he can pull it off and fear the company may be in permanent decline.\nIntel wound up in such dire straits owing to missteps in its core business for central processing units (CPUs), in which it was once the unrivaled king. Production delays and problems in its own fab facilities have let rival AMD steal significant market share.\nDistracted while trying to fix these issues, Intel failed to see the extent to which graphics chips would come to dominate the market for AI. Instead, it thought AI would be run on systems that still had CPUs at their heart.\n\u201cThe strategy has been to fix the core business and don\u2019t worry about the ancillary stuff,\u201d says Alan Priestley, a Gartner vice president analyst. \u201cGPUs were the ancillary stuff.\u201d\nEven after Intel belatedly recognized the fast-growing market for AI-specific chips, it bungled its efforts to get into the AI game. In 2019, it announced its own GPU design for AI called Ponte Vecchio. But the design was complicated, requiring three different fab processes to make, and expensive. Worse, its performance couldn\u2019t match that of Nvidia\u2019s chips. This year, Gelsinger shelved Ponte Vecchio in favor of a new design due in 2025.\nIntel also bought AI chip startups but struggled to turn their products into blockbusters. In 2016, it purchased Nervana for $350 million, but took years to roll out chips based on its technology. When it did, they had already been eclipsed by Nvidia. Then in 2019, it bought Israeli AI chip startup Habana Labs for $2 billion. Intel says Habana\u2019s chips beat Nvidia\u2019s. But these claims have not been independently verified, and Intel expects only $500 million in sales from Habana\u2019s latest chips this year, compared with Nvidia\u2019s tens of billions of dollars in revenue.\nIntel did not respond to a request to make Gelsinger or other executives available to comment for this article. But Gelsinger publicly acknowledges the impossibility of displacing Nvidia\u2019s dominance in chips for training large AI models anytime soon. \u201cIn that race, you know, [Nvidia] are so far ahead,\u201d the CEO said at a technology conference in August.\nInstead, Gelsinger thinks Intel can compete in the market for AI inference\u2014 running AI models that have already been trained. He also says another new Intel chip will be a hit for use in laptops and PCs that run AI applications.\nBut Intel\u2019s board has reportedly voiced concerns about Gelsinger\u2019s AI strategy not being aggressive enough to ensure Intel will play a significant role in what is now the fastest-growing market for chips.\nGelsinger\u2019s immediate problem is that Intel is hemorrhaging cash. The 18A gamble is expensive. The company has committed $185 billion to build new fabs and upgrade existing ones.\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nMeanwhile, costs for Intel\u2019s planned Arizona fabs and two more in Ohio have soared past initial projections. The Arizona plants, which Intel is counting on having online in 2025, have been hit by construction delays. And in September, Reuters reported that Broadcom, which makes networking and radio chips, had tested Intel\u2019s process and concluded it was not yet ready for full production.\nAmid this bad news, Intel\u2019s foundry business has notched a few precious wins: In September, Amazon\u2019s AWS agreed to manufacture a next-generation AI chip at Intel\u2019s 18A fabs. Intel previously struck a similar deal with Microsoft.\nFinding the money to pay for 18A, though, is rapidly becoming an existential crisis. Intel\u2019s annual sales have flagged\u2014down $24 billion, or 30%, since Gelsinger took over. In 2022, the company\u2019s free cash flow turned negative. It has worsened since then. As of late June, Intel was burning through $12.6 billion more cash than it was taking in on an annual basis. Investors have reacted to the cascade of troubles by punishing Intel\u2019s stock, driving its shares down almost 60% so far this year.\nTo reassure Wall Street, Gelsinger has been forced into painful decisions. In August, he announced $10 billion in cost cutting that included laying off 15,000 employees\u201415% of Intel\u2019s workforce. He also reduced capital spending by $5 billion and suspended Intel\u2019s dividend.\nThen, in September, he announced more radical action: Intel\u2019s foundry business will be formally spun off as a separate subsidiary. The hope is that this will reassure potential foundry customers that their design secrets won\u2019t leak to Intel\u2019s product division and that Intel won\u2019t prioritize its own production needs over theirs. Critically, it will also let the foundry business raise capital from outside investors, possibly alleviating Intel\u2019s cash woes. Gelsinger also shelved plans for a new $32 billion fab in Germany, as well as new facilities in Poland.\nThe company has turned to the U.S. government for help, too. Intel has been counting on money from the U.S. CHIPS Act, signed by President Biden to boost domestic chip production, to assist in paying for some of its new 18A fabs. In March it was awarded $8.5 billion in direct CHIPS funding and $11 billion in loans. But the money is tied to Intel hitting certain construction milestones, and it has yet to receive any funds.\nAt some point Gelsinger may be forced to choose between preserving Intel\u2019s core chip-design division\u2014and selling off the foundry business entirely, an admission that his 18A strategy has failed. Whatever Intel ultimately does, drastic measures are likely necessary if Gelsinger still hopes to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.\nThis article appears in the October/November 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline \"A wounded Intel battles for survival in the AI era.\"\nMore from the October/November issue of Fortune:\u2013Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the robot revolution to end hard work\u2013How the election broke Silicon Valley\u2013How GM CEO Mary Barra is transforming the auto giant for the EV future\u2013Where Silicon Valley is spending its millions in political donations, charted\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Its forecast helped spur a rally in chip stocks, including Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia, which all were up more than 2%.\nOn the data front, retail sales jumped 0.4%, more than the 0.3% rise expected, giving credence to the argument the economy could be reaccelerating following a surprisingly strong September jobs report. Weekly jobless claims came in at 241,000, far below expectations, and a drop from the prior week's upwardly revised 260,000.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%.\nStrong economic data also helped lift stocks.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 October 14, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Intel INTC and Nvidia NVDA.\nIntel shares have largely been disappointing in 2024, unable to fully join the semiconductor trade and down more than 50%. Quarterly results have added fuel to the fire sale, with the stock unable to find any meaningful traction post-earnings.\nBelow is a chart illustrating the YTD performance of Intel shares relative to the S&P 500, with its quarterly releases illustrated by the circled arrows.\nGiven the steep decline from highs, could it finally be time to go on the offensive and pick up some shares? Let's take a closer look.\nCurrently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish earnings estimate revisions from analysts. Expectations for its current fiscal year have been notably negative, with the $0.27 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down 85% over the last year.\nThe negative revisions, caused by unfavorable quarterly results, bode poorly for near-term share performance.\nStill, it's worth noting that CEO Pat Gelsinger remains confident, buying 12.5k shares at a total transaction value of roughly $250k in early August following the latest quarterly print. He noted that second-half trends are more challenging than anticipated but still expects the company to restrengthen its position in the market.\nCost-cutting measures have also been a huge focus for the company over recent periods after margin pressures, as we can see in the chart below. In fact, Intel announced a $10 billion cost-savings target earlier in August.\nAre Intel Shares a Buy?\nInvestors should stay on the sidelines until positive earnings estimate revisions roll in, which would signal a meaningful change in sentiment. Earnings expectations for its upcoming release expected on October 24th have already been slashed, with the company now expected to post a loss of -$0.03 per share.\nIt's worth noting that INTC shares have been red-hot over the last month, gaining nearly 20%. While the positive price action has been inspiring, the bulk of the move has likely been fueled by a short squeeze following rumors of buyouts.\nFor those seeking semiconductor exposure, there are many more positive stories, a list that obviously includes beloved AI-favorite Nvidia. Nvidia currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook shifting higher across the board following unbelievable quarterly results.\nAnd concerning the top line, Nvidia's sales are forecasted to more than double in its current fiscal year.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Author": "  Howard Smith, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has had a wild several months. After hitting a new all-time high in June, share prices of the advanced semiconductor chip supplier dropped more than 30%. The stock then surged again, followed by another sharp drop and then a return to a new high-water mark. That volatility is the result of strong sales and earnings growth and high investor expectations, balanced against a high valuation.\nOne Wall Street analyst thinks the bullish investors have it right, and Nvidia stock can move higher by another 25% from its recent level. Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes thinks investors should buy the stock and sees it worth $165 per share.\nOne big assumption for Reitzes' bullish stance is his belief that Nvidia has built a competitive advantage that will last. In his new research note reported on in Barron's, he wrote, \"Nvidia's greatest achievement is creating an infrastructure that works at all the big clouds down to the smallest -- and can be monetized the fastest.\"\nThat advantage includes a moat created with Nvidia's CUDA software program kit. While the company releases its new, stronger chips like its latest Blackwell GPU (graphics processing unit), the proprietary parallel computing platform allows customers large and small to still make use of previously purchased Hopper series chips to accelerate the overall development of their artificial intelligence (AI) needs.\nThat makes Nvidia sticky to customers. They can continue to increase compute power for AI training while still getting returns from investments in earlier GPU products. And there is still plenty of spending for AI growth. In a recent podcast interview, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated:\nThe entire computing technology stack is being reinvented. We have a trillion dollars' worth of data centers that we have to modernize.\nNvidia has a hook in for much of that capital spending. It's the thrust of why Reitzes thinks the stock still has plenty of room to run. And it's a case that investors should buy into.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Do NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Earnings Warrant Your Attention?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nStrong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. Which is why EPS growth is looked upon so favourably. It's an outstanding feat for NVIDIA to have grown EPS from US$0.41 to US$2.16 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. This could point to the business hitting a point of inflection.\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that NVIDIA is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 28.8 percentage points to 62%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\nFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of NVIDIA's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.\nOwing to the size of NVIDIA, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$120b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\nNVIDIA's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So at the surface level, NVIDIA is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. You still need to take note of risks, for example - NVIDIA has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which can't be ignored)  we think you should know about.\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 October 4, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM and Accenture ACN.\nSince OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT chatbot became the fastest-growing consumer app in history, big tech companies have been spending money furiously in hopes of profiting from the coming artificial intelligence (AI) revolution or at least avoiding being disrupted by it.\n\u201cI am telling you, the world\u2019s first trillionaires are going to come from somebody who masters AI and all its derivatives and applies it in ways we never thought of.\u201d ~ Mark Cuban\nDespite Wall Street\u2019s concerns of an AI bubble or an overhyped innovation, several of the world\u2019s brightest tech minds, and those who participated in the last meteoric technological revolution have weighed in. Everyone whose anyone in tech, from Peter Thiel to Bill Gates to Elon Musk has weighed in on AI and believes the hype is real.\n\u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks have trounced the broader market regarding earnings growth and stock prices. The success of America\u2019s big tech juggernauts has led to massive cash hoards.\nNevertheless, big tech CEOs are not resting on their laurels regarding the next big revolution. In fact, the largest tech firms spent an eye-popping $100 billion on AI during the first six months of 2024 alone (up nearly 50% vs. 2023). However, with little in the way of revenue to show for the spending, many analysts on Wall Street are wondering if the expenditure will slow down, leading to an AI stock correction.\nTo answer those concerns, no better AI proxy exists than Nvidia, the undisputed AI leader. In a television interview Thursday, CEO Jensen Huang quelled concerns. Huang updated investors on Blackwell, Nvidia\u2019s most sophisticated and next generation chip, saying that demand for it is \u201cinsane.\u201d He also divulged that Blackwell is in \u201cfull production\u201d after a brief delay attributed to Nvidia supplier Taiwan Semiconductor.\nHuang\u2019s primary reason for making the TV appearance was to tout the company\u2019s deal with consulting giant Accenture. Accenture will leverage Nvidia\u2019s AI suite to scale its AI applications, spur innovation, drive efficiency, and cut costs.\nIn other news, OpenAI officially changed its business structure from a non-profit to a for profit entity last week. This week, OpenAI announced a successful fresh round of funding that values the start-up at $150 billion. Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark is one notable investor who reportedly participated in the round.\nArk, best known for investing in disruptors, invested $250 million in OpenAI. A recent chart shared by Ark Invest shows that large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Bing are potentially eating into Google\u2019s dominant search engine share.\nMany Wall Street analysts are concerned that the AI spending sugar high will wear off. However, Nvidia\u2019s \u201cinsane demand\u201d and OpenAI\u2019s massive valuation suggest that the bull market in AI spend is unlikely to subside soon.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nTwo years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nAmid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.\nAs semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Longer term, the advisory sees AI adoption remaining in 3rd/4th innings while noting that Blackwell driven sales and gross margin inflection will be coming in the April 2025 quarter.\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NYSE:COHR) stands against the other AI stocks.\nCompanies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to meet the growing demands of machine learning, data processing, and AI-driven applications. This spending is largely concentrated on building data centers, acquiring specialized hardware, and optimizing cloud infrastructure. According to a report by McKinsey, global AI infrastructure spending could reach up to $500 billion by 2027, highlighting the critical role it plays in the future of AI development. A large part of this investment is focused on AI-specific hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are crucial for training and deploying AI models. NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI chips, has seen demand for its GPUs soar, largely due to their centrality in deep learning tasks. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, has remarked that the AI boom is underpinned by massive infrastructure needs, and the market is just at the beginning of this growth curve.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nData centers are another focal point for AI infrastructure spending. AI workloads are highly demanding, requiring specialized facilities that can support high-density computing environments. Blackstone\u2019s $16 billion acquisition of AirTrunk, a leader in AI-driven data centers, underscores the increasing importance of such infrastructure. The deal will add 800 MW of data center capacity, with projections to grow beyond 1 GW, a testament to the rising demand for infrastructure to support AI-driven applications. Cloud infrastructure is also a major area where companies are pouring resources. Cloud giants are increasing their investments in AI infrastructure. These companies are developing new AI-optimized cloud services to cater to businesses adopting AI. Gartner predicts that by 2026, cloud AI infrastructure spending will surpass $200 billion, as enterprises increasingly shift from on-premise AI deployments to scalable cloud-based solutions.\nThomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, recently remarked that AI is unlocking entirely new revenue streams for enterprises, and cloud infrastructure is the backbone enabling this transformation. Beyond just hardware, organizations are also investing in data management platforms and storage solutions to handle the massive amounts of data AI systems require. In fact, estimates suggest that the global AI data infrastructure market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18%, driven by increased data volumes and the need for real-time data processing capabilities. Companies are significantly ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, focusing on hardware, data centers, and cloud computing.

        "Title": "3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Nvidia (NVDA)",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nNvidia (NVDA) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 67.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 117.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -23.1%.\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 2.2%.\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.5% over the past month.\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Is Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Hand Over Fist",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Billionaire Ken Griffin is the founder and CEO of Citadel Advisors, the highest-ranked hedge fund as measured by net gains since inception, according to LCH Investments. The means Griffin is arguably the most successful hedge fund manager in history, which makes him a good case study for individual investors.\nGriffin sold 9.2 million shares of Nvidia in the second quarter, reducing his position by 72%. Meanwhile, he added 5.2 million shares of Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR), increasing his stake by 1,140%. Importantly, Citadel still had twice as much capital invested in Nvidia as Palantir as of June 30, so it would be wrong to assume Griffin lacks confidence in the chipmaker.\nThat said, nothing changes the fact that he sold Nvidia stock and purchased a substantial amount of Palantir stock during the second quarter. And Griffin is not the only Palantir bull. The stock has surged 140% year to date. Here's what investors should know.\nData analytics company Palantir has reported increasingly impressive financial results over the past year. In the second quarter, its clientele increased 41% and the average customer spent 14% more. In turn, revenue rose 27% to $678 million, marking the fourth straight acceleration, and non-GAAP earnings increased 80% to $0.09 per diluted share.\nAdditionally, remaining performance obligation increased 41% to $1.4 billion, hinting that sales growth may accelerate further in future quarters. Management also raised its full-year guidance, such that revenue is now forecasted to increase 23% in 2024. Previously, Palantir anticipated 21% revenue growth, but strong execution surrounding its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has altered its top-line trajectory.\nTo elaborate, Palantir sells data analytics software. Its primary platforms, Foundry and Gotham, let businesses collect data, develop machine learning models, and incorporate those assets into applications that drive better decision-making. AIP adds support for large language models to Foundry and Gotham, which enables clients to \"bring the power of generative AI into their most critical operations,\" according to Palantir Chief Architect Akshay Krishnaswamy.\nThe product has garnered praise from industry observers. Earlier this year, Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities called AIP the \"launching pad of AI use cases\" for many U.S. enterprises. Additionally, Forrester Research recently recognized Palantir as a leader in machine learning and artificial intelligence platforms. \"Palantir is quietly becoming one of the largest players in this market,\" analysts wrote in the report.\nPalantir has reoriented its go-to-market strategy around AIP bootcamps, workshops where prospective clients learn to use the platform in days. Over 1,025 organizations attended bootcamps in the past year, and those events have been a huge success. \"The persistent and unbridled demand for our software, for an effective enterprise platform that makes artificial intelligence capabilities useful to large institutions, shows no sign of relenting,\" CEO Alex Karp wrote in his recent shareholder letter.\nThe problem with Palantir is its stratospheric share price. Wall Street expects its adjusted earnings to increase 22% over the next year. That consensus figure makes the current valuation of 130 times adjusted earnings look very expensive. Those figures give a PEG ratio close to 6. For context, PEG ratios below 1 are generally considered cheap, while ratios between 1 and 2 are seen as reasonable.\nIn that sense, Palantir's stock would still be expensive even if the company's earnings grow twice as fast as analysts anticipate over the next year. Not surprisingly, Wall Street is quite bearish. Palantir's median price target of $27 per share implies 35% downside from its current share price of $41.45. No other company in the S&P 500 has a greater discrepancy between its current price and median price target, according to FactSet Research.\nGiven the current valuation, I wouldn't be surprised if Ken Griffin sold down his Palantir position in the third quarter. Either way, I think investors should avoid this stock until the price drops substantially. Additionally, shareholders with big positions in Palantir should consider selling a few shares right now.\nAs a final thought, Wall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to increase 53% over the next year. That makes the current valuation of 60 times adjusted earnings look reasonable. Those figures give a palatable PEG ratio of 1.1. To that end, I wouldn't be surprised if Ken Griffin added to his Nvidia position in the third quarter.\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adrian Volenik ",
        "Text": "Jensen Huang, the CEO and co-founder of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), has seen his fortune soar to about $106 billion in just five years. Once worth $3.8 billion, Huang is now the 13th richest person in the world, thanks to the surging demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), essential for artificial intelligence (A.I.) products. But as his wealth has skyrocketed, so has the scrutiny over how he gives back to society.\nDon't Miss:\nUnlock a $400 billion opportunity by investing in the future of EV infrastructure on this startup already valued at $50 million with just $500.\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\nNvidia currently has a market capitalization of almost $3 trillion and is the third most valuable company in the world, behind only Apple ($3.4 T) and Microsoft ($3.1 T). The main cause for such a high valuation is that the company now controls between 70% and 95% of the global market for AI processors used in generative models like ChatGPT. Additionally, Nvidia\u2019s shares have jumped over 170% in just the past year, boosting Huang\u2019s wealth and cementing his status in the tech industry.\nSee Also: General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\nIt\u2019s amazing to see Huang\u2019s route to success. As a youngster, he worked cleaning toilets and as a dishwasher at Denny\u2019s. He fondly recalls, \"I mean, I cleaned a lot of toilets. I've cleaned more toilets than all of you combined \u2013 and some of them you just can\u2019t unsee.\"\nHis work ethic and approach to leadership are bar none. He emphasizes, \"To me, no task is beneath me because I used to be a dishwasher [and] I used to clean toilets.\"\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nDue to his enormous wealth, Huang has significantly increased the amount of money he donates to charity. By 2022, the foundation\u2019s assets had grown from $13.2 million in 2007 to around $1 billion, according to the Observer.\nHis altruistic efforts frequently benefit local causes in California, Nvidia\u2019s home state, as well as higher education and diversity in the AI field. Remarkably, his charity, the Jen-Hsun & Lori Huang charity, has contributed significantly to colleges, including Oregon State University and Stanford.\nTrending: Teens may never need wisdom teeth removed thanks to this MedTech Company \u2013 Be an early investor for just $300 for 100 shares!\nHowever, much of Huang's philanthropy has been directed toward donor-advised funds (DAFs) rather than traditional nonprofits. In 2022, the foundation donated $66.3 million, with a significant portion going to a fund at Schwab Charitable, a DAF sponsor.\nReports recently indicated that the Huang Foundation controls 69 million shares of Nvidia, currently valued at over $8 billion. This makes it the 20th largest foundation in the U.S. and its assets have increased eightfold since the end of 2022.\nIn addition, Huang and his wife manage the GeForce Fund, also a donor-advised fund that holds an undisclosed number of Nvidia shares, with DAFgiving360 estimating that $4.4 billion of Nvidia stock is aggregated in funds controlled by the couple and their foundation.\nWhile DAFs provide tax benefits and allow donors to maintain control over their giving, they have come under fire for their lack of transparency and accountability.\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nThe main cause of Huang\u2019s charitable criticism is his reliance on DAFs. Unlike traditional charities, which must give away at least 5% of their assets annually, DAFs can hold onto funds for years without distributing them. Because of this, some have questioned whether Huang\u2019s philanthropic methods are truly selfless or just intended to gain tax benefits.\nWhile DAFs offer a great deal of control over charity contributions, experts have pointed out that they can also cause money to remain unused for long stretches of time, which can restrict the immediate influence that gifts could have on urgent social issues.\nRead Next:\nUnlock a $400 billion opportunity by investing in the future of EV infrastructure on this startup already valued at $50 million with just $500.\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion \u2013 they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "Title": "Could Nvidia Stock Soar if Kamala Harris Becomes President?",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) share price has skyrocketed more than 800% while Kamala Harris has served as vice president of the United States. That's a bigger gain than the stock delivered when Donald Trump was in the White House. It's also larger than the returns generated during any of the four-year terms of Barack Obama and George W. Bush.\nOf course, Harris doesn't set government policies while she is vice president, nor power the Nvidia-buoying AI boom sparked by ChatGPT's release to the public in 2022. But it will be a different story -- for the former -- if she defeats Donald Trump in November. Could Nvidia stock soar if Kamala Harris becomes president?\nHarris has proposed several major economic policies since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. She wants to cut taxes for working Americans. The vice president seeks to lower food and grocery costs in part by targeting corporate \"price gouging.\" Harris proposes strengthening Obamacare. She wants to address the U.S. housing shortage by offering incentives and tax credits.\nNone of those proposals are very relevant to Nvidia. However, the vice president has put forward some policies that could affect the chipmaker. Of course, presidents have to work with others to get things done, so no campaign promise or policy plan is a guarantee.\nHarris wants to raise the corporate tax rate that companies pay from 21% to 28%. This would roll back the tax cuts passed during the Trump administration but still leave the corporate tax rate at a lower level than it has been historically. Additionally, she has proposed quadrupling the tax rate on corporate stock buybacks.\nHarris says she plans to offer new tax credits to support \"critical industries of the future.\" These tax credits would, among other things, help promote building new data centers for artificial intelligence (AI) and \"revitalizing America's semiconductor industry.\" She also wants to keep in place the AI executive order signed by President Joe Biden that included safeguards aimed at preventing safety and security issues with AI technology.\nAt first glance, you might think increasing the corporate tax rate to 28% could hurt Nvidia quite a bit. However, that's not necessarily the case. The table below shows how much Nvidia's effective tax rate has been over the last four years:\nFiscal Year\nEffective Tax Rate\n2021\n1.7%\n2022\n1.9%\n2023\n(4.5% tax benefit)*\n2024\n12%\nData source: Nvidia 10-K filings. The company's fiscal year ends in late January. *Nvidia received more back from the government as a result of tax benefits than it paid in taxes in 2023.\nMaybe Harris' proposed corporate tax rate increase would negatively affect Nvidia, but over the last four years, the company's effective tax rate has been much less than the 21% tax rate implemented when Trump was president. As the table above shows, Nvidia has demonstrated its prowess at using the tax code to its advantage to have an effective tax rate that's much lower than the standard corporate tax rate. It could very well continue to do so in a Harris administration.\nHarris' plans to quadruple the tax rate on stock buybacks could cause Nvidia to change how it allocates capital. The company spent $9.7 billion on share repurchases in its last fiscal year and bought back nearly $14.9 billion of its shares in the first half of the current fiscal year. Nvidia could choose to deploy more money to fund dividends or reinvest in its business instead of repurchasing shares if Harris' plans take effect.\nThe bottom line, though, is that significantly higher taxes on stock buybacks probably wouldn't impact Nvidia's business much, if at all. And while buybacks can increase the price of existing shares by lowering overall share count, investors could still benefit if the company boosts its dividend payout or grows more rapidly due to investing more in its business.\nWhat about Harris' proposal to provide tax credits to support the building of AI data centers and the U.S. semiconductor industry? These tax credits might benefit Nvidia to some extent. However, the vice president's plans don't include the dollar amounts involved. Without these details, it's impossible to evaluate how the proposed policy could impact Nvidia.\nLet's return to our initial question: Could Nvidia stock soar if Harris is elected president? Yes, the stock certainly could soar during a Harris administration -- but not necessarily because of any specific policies Harris might implement.\nBased on what is known at this point, none of Harris' proposed policies would likely make a huge impact on Nvidia's business. And that's assuming she could win enough support in Congress to implement her ideas. Every president faces the challenge of persuading legislators to go along with his or her approach. Sometimes they're successful, but sometimes they're not.\nNvidia's fortunes depend much more on the demand for its GPUs than they do on government policies, regardless of who sits in the Oval Office. I think this demand will remain strong for years to come. If so, chances are that Nvidia stock will soar if Harris becomes president.\nHowever, I wouldn't bet on the chipmaker's share price rising as much as it did during her tenure as vice president. It's a daunting challenge for any company with a market cap approaching $3 trillion to deliver a 9x return in four years.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Anton Shilov ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nNvidia's\u00a0Blackwell GPUs\u00a0for AI and HPC faced a slight delay due to a\u00a0yield-killing issue with packaging\u00a0that required a redesign, but it looks like this did not impact demand for these processors. According to the company's management questioned by Morgan Stanley analysts (via\u00a0Barron's), the supply of Nvidia Blackwell GPUs for the next 12 months has been sold out, which mimics a situation with Hopper GPUs supply several quarters ago. As a result, Nvidia is expected to gain market share next year (via\u00a0Seeking Alpha).\nMorgan Stanley analysts shared insights from recent meetings with Nvidia's leadership, including CEO Jensen Huang. During these meetings, it was revealed that orders for the Blackwell GPUs are already sold out for the next 12 months. This means new customers placing orders today must wait until late next year to receive their orders.\nNvidia's traditional customers (AWS, CoreWeave, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle, to name some) have bought every Blackwell GPU that Nvidia and its partner TSMC will be able to produce in the coming quarters.\nSuch an overwhelming demand may indicate that Nvidia might gain market share next year despite intensified competition from AMD, Intel, cloud service providers (with proprietary offerings), and various smaller companies.\n\"Our view continues to be that Nvidia is likely to actually gain share of AI processors in 2025, as the biggest users of custom silicon are seeing very steep ramps with Nvidia solutions next year,\" Joseph Moore, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to clients. \"Everything that we heard this week reinforced that.\"\nNow that packaging issues of Nvidia's B100 and B200 GPUs have been resolved, Nvidia can produce as many Blackwell GPUs as TSMC can. Both B100 and B200 use TSMC's CoWoS-L packaging, and whether the world's largest chip contract maker has enough CoWoS-L capacity remains to be seen.\nAlso, as demand for AI GPUs is skyrocketing, it remains to be seen whether memory makers can supply enough HBM3E memory for leading-edge GPUs like Blackwell. In particular, Nvidia has yet to qualify Samsung's HBM3E memory for its Blackwell GPUs, another factor influencing supply.\n"

        "Title": "Want to Buy Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple? Consider This Vanguard Growth ETF",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is home to 500 different companies, but it's weighted by market capitalization, which means the largest names in the index have a greater influence over its performance than the smallest.\nApple, Nvidia, and Microsoft are the top three companies in the S&P 500, with a combined market cap of $9.8 trillion, which represents 19.7% of the index. Nvidia stock, for example, was up 156% through the first half of 2024, which accounted for one-third of the entire 15% gain in the S&P 500.\nIn other words, investors who don't have America's tech giants in their portfolio are probably underperforming the broader market. But there's a simple way to buy them without having to predict which ones might deliver the best returns from here.\nThe Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a concentrated portfolio filled with the largest tech stocks an investor could want. Here's why it might be a great alternative to buying individual stocks.\nETFs can hold hundreds, or even thousands, of different stocks. However, the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF holds just 71, so it's ideal for investors who already have an existing portfolio, but specifically want to add some exposure to the largest growth companies in America.\nThe ETF holds stocks from 10 different sectors of the economy, but technology has a whopping 61.4% weighting because of the sheer size of companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia.\nIn fact, the ETF is highly concentrated toward its top five holdings for that reason. The table shows their weightings in the ETF, compared to their weightings in the S&P 500 index:\nStock\nVanguard ETF Portfolio Weighting\nS&P 500 Weighting\n1. Apple\n13.52%\n6.97%\n2. Microsoft\n12.68%\n6.54%\n3. Nvidia\n11.29%\n6.20%\n4. Meta Platforms\n4.96%\n2.41%\n5. Amazon\n4.54%\n3.45%\nData source: Vanguard. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Aug. 31, and are subject to change.\nHaving a much higher weighting toward these stocks can be a double-edged sword. It means the Vanguard ETF will outperform the S&P 500 when those specific stocks are doing well, but it's likely to underperform if they hit a rough patch, because it lacks diversity relative to the index.\nWith that said, these five companies are among the most important players in the fast-growing artificial intelligence (AI) industry. Apple is rolling out its Apple Intelligence software, which it developed in partnership with OpenAI. It's going to transform the way iPhone, iPad, and Mac users create and consume content. Since Apple has over 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, the company could soon become the biggest distributor of AI to consumers.\nMicrosoft and Amazon have developed their own AI virtual assistants, which are embedded into their flagship software products. Plus, the Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services cloud platforms are two of the largest AI distribution channels for businesses, allowing them to access ready-made models and data center computing power for their development needs.\nNvidia's graphics processing chips (GPUs) for the data center are at the heart of the entire AI revolution. Its H100 GPU set the benchmark for AI developers last year, and the company is preparing to ship large volumes of its new Blackwell-based GPUs, which will deliver an incredible leap in performance and cost efficiency.\nOutside its top five positions, the Vanguard ETF also holds popular megacap stocks like Eli Lilly, Tesla, Costco Wholesale, and McDonald's -- so it isn't all about technology.\nThe Vanguard ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 13.1% since it was established in 2007, which is much better than the average annual return of 10.2% in the S&P 500.\nThe ETF has delivered an even stronger compound annual return of 20.2% over the last five years. That's because of the rapid adoption of technologies like cloud computing and AI, which have propelled stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon to multitrillion-dollar valuations. The S&P 500 has gained 16.7% per year (on average) over that same stretch.\nIn other words, if technology stocks continue to lead the broader market higher, investors should expect the Vanguard ETF to outperform the S&P 500 because of its enormous exposure to the sector. Some forecasts on Wall Street suggest AI could add anywhere from $7 trillion to $200 trillion to the global economy over the next decade. If that's true, tech stocks will be one of the best places to invest.\nConversely, if AI fails to live up to the hype, the Vanguard ETF could underperform for a period of time because stocks like Nvidia would lose a chunk of the value they have created over the last couple of years.\nThis Vanguard ETF is very cheap to own, with an expense ratio of just 0.07% (the portion of the fund deducted each year to cover management costs), which is more than 90% cheaper than comparable funds, according to Vanguard. Therefore, investors seeking exposure to the big end of the stock market without having to pick individual winners and losers should look no further.\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has arguably been the hottest investment theme for two years, and Nvidia has been one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But there are other worthwhile trends. The hedge fund managers listed below sold shares of Nvidia in the second quarter, while purchasing shares of e-commerce stocks Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) or MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI).\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors sold 9.2 million shares of Nvidia, slashing his stake 79%. He also bought 17,644 shares of Shopify, adding 1% to his position.\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 96,963 shares of Nvidia in the second quarter, reducing his stake 1%. He also bought 66,659 shares of Shopify, adding 2% to his position.\nSteven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management sold 409,042 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake 16%. He also bought 45,958 shares of MercadoLibre, starting a new position.\nStanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office sold 1.5 million shares of Nvidia, cutting his stake 88%. He also bought 36,493 shares of MercadoLibre, opening a new position.\nAll four billionaire fund managers still have exposure to Nvidia, so it would be wrong to assume they've lost confidence in the chipmaker. Instead, the lesson here is portfolio diversification matters, and e-commerce is a worthwhile investment theme. Here's what investors should know about Shopify and MercadoLibre.\nShopify provides a turnkey solution for commerce. Its platform lets sellers manage their businesses across physical and digital channels, including online marketplaces, social media networks, and custom websites. Shopify also provides adjacent solutions for marketing, payments, and logistics, as well as more sophisticated tools for data analytics, event management, and business-to-business (B2B) commerce.\nShopify has a strong competitive position. Analysts have recognized its market leadership in e-commerce and omnichannel commerce software. Shopify merchants account for 10% retail e-commerce sales in the U.S. and 6% of retail e-commerce sales in Western Europe. Additionally, Forrester Research and the International Data Corp (IDC) recently recognized the company as a leader in B2B commerce solutions.\nShopify reported solid financial results in the second quarter, exceeding estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 21% to $2 billion on strong momentum in subscription software and merchant services. That said, revenue increased 25% when adjusted for the sale of the logistics business last year. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income increase 85% to $0.26 per dilute share.\nImportantly, management reported strong momentum with offline retail, B2B commerce, and international merchants, three areas where the company has prioritized investments. That bodes well for shareholders. Shopify values its addressable market at $849 billion, and more than half of that figure comes from offline retail and B2B e-commerce.\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Shopify's adjusted earnings to increase at 26% annually through 2027, which makes the current valuation of 77 times adjusted earnings look expensive. However, Shopify is a brilliant company with a long runway for growth, so patient investors eager to own the stock can buy a very small position today, provided they are comfortable with the idea of a pullback. If shares decline 10% to 20%, investors should use drawdown to buy a bigger position.\nMercadoLibre runs the largest online marketplace in Latin America as measured by visitors and revenue, and the company is still gaining market share. It will account for 29% of retail e-commerce sales in the region in 2024, up from 28.3% in 2023, according to eMarketer.\nOne reason MercadoLibre is gaining share is its ecosystem of adjacent solutions. It offers logistics support and ad tech software, as well as payment processing and lending services that make its marketplace more convenient for merchants. In fact, it has the \"fastest and most extensive delivery network in the region.\" The company is also the third-largest digital advertiser and one of the largest fintech platforms in Latin America.\nMercadoLibre reported very strong financial results in the second quarter. Revenue rose 41% to $5 billion as sales growth accelerated sequentially in the commerce and fintech segments. Meanwhile, GAAP earnings increased 103% to $10.48 per diluted share as net profit margin expanded 3 percentage points to 10.5%, the highest level in eight years.\nImportantly, commerce segment sales have now accelerated sequentially in five straight quarters, due in part to strength in advertising and traction with the MELI+ loyalty program. Investors have good reason to believe that momentum will continue. Retail ad spending in Latin America is forecasted to grow at 33% annually through 2028, according to eMarketer. MercadoLibre is the largest retail media company in the region.\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects MercadoLibre's earnings to increase at 45% annually through 2025. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 74 times earnings look reasonable. Patient investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in this growth stock today.\nBefore you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Shopify wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500 clinch fresh highs as Nvidia surges to record",
        "Author": " Karen Friar   ,  Ines Ferr\u00e9    and  Josh Schafer    ",
        "Text": "US stocks rose on Monday with two major indexes clinching record closes as Nvidia (NVDA) led a risk-on rally in the market that permeated through most sectors and even into cryptocurrencies.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up nearly 0.8% to close at a fresh record after ending above 5,800 for the first time on Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped nearly 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 200 points, or almost 0.5%, to close above the 43,000 level for the first time.\nTech stocks led the day's gains, with chip giant Nvidia rising nearly 3% to close at a new high above $138 per share. Other semiconductor stocks also surged including chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Arm Holdings (ARM), and Applied Materials (AMAT).\nAnd the rally broadened even to cryptocurrency, as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also rallied, adding nearly 8% on the day.\nEarnings are taking center stage as the first full week of third quarter results gets underway. How the season plays out is seen as key to the rally in stocks as the bull market turns 2 years old.\nThe Dow and S&P 500 entered this week at new records after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) earnings largely passed Wall Street's test. Investor focus is staying on big banks with reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Citi (C), and Bank of America (BAC) on Tuesday's docket, and Morgan Stanley (MS) due Wednesday.\nAt the same time, there's still uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again. A benign jobs report and data showing \"sticky\" consumer and wholesale inflation are building a case for no rate cut in November, some analysts argue. Retail sales data later in the week will feed into the debate as to whether the economy has held up in the face of Fed policy \u2014 the preferred soft landing.\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nNvidia rose nearly 3% to close above $138 per share for the first time ever. This surpassed Nvidia's prior record close of $135.58 in June.\nThe stock\u2019s climb began Oct. 2 following the announcement of a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Investors believe much of that funding could be funneled back to Nvidia, as OpenAI's growing energy demands will require more of its AI chips.\nThat news was followed up by a swath of bullishness from Wall Street analysts as investors anxiously await the latest quarterly reports from Big Tech companies in the coming weeks.\nFederal Reserve governor Christopher Waller offered a sense of wariness when talking about the Fed's path forward for interest rate cuts.\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:\nWaller said Monday that the central bank needs to proceed with \"more caution\" when cutting rates as he absorbs recent data showing a strong job market and hotter-than-expected inflation.\n\"Data is signaling that the economy may not be slowing as much as desired,\" Waller said in a speech at Stanford University in California.\n\"While we do not want to overreact to this data or look through it, I view the totality of the data as saying monetary policy should proceed with more caution on the pace of rate cuts than was needed at the September meeting.\"\nRead more here.\nThe Federal Reserve held interest rates at multi-decade highs for more than a year. Investors took notice, piling into money market accounts to grab yield that hadn't been available in more than a decade.\nBut since the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18, the flows into money market accounts haven't stopped. In fact, through Oct. 10, research provided to Yahoo Finance from Crane Data shows that money market fund assets have increased by about $180 billion since the Fed began cutting rates.\nThis reveals a truth about the surge of \"cash on the sidelines\" some have argued could be a reason for the stock market rally to continue. For starters, it could be a nod to the uncertainty some feel about where things will head over the next year.\nOn Friday, Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note to clients that \"history does not lend much support to expectations of a cash-to-equity rotation.\" Kostin's research, as seen in our Chart of the Day, shows that since 1984, over the first three, six, and 12 month periods after the Fed begins cutting, flows into money market funds are greater than into equity or bond funds.\nKostin expressed a view we've written about in the past, noting that whether or not equities see inflows following rate cuts has more to do with why the Fed is cutting than the cuts themselves. \n\"Money market funds have historically experienced inflows following rate cuts regardless of the economic backdrop,\" Kostin said. \"On the other hand, equity funds typically recorded inflows if the US economy avoided a recession and outflows if the US economy entered a recession shortly after the start of the cutting cycle.\"\nGoldman Sachs upgraded its China growth forecast over the weekend, citing recent stimulus measures and new commentary from government officials that showed an openness to spend more aggressively to revive its economy.\nThe bank raised its full-year China GDP forecast to 4.9% from 4.7% and also upped its 2025 growth prediction to 4.7% from 4.3%. Beijing has previously said it's aiming for an annual growth target of \"around 5%.\"\nOn Saturday, China's finance ministry hinted at another large stimulus package to support the country's ailing property sector and suggested more government borrowing, although the ministry stopped short of unveiling the exact size or scale of spending.\nAlthough vague, the comments left the door open for a more aggressive fiscal package, which investors are increasingly betting on as Beijing attempts to pull itself out of a long slump spurred by deflationary pressures from a sluggish property market and weak domestic demand.\nOptimism that the government will follow through boosted Chinese stocks on Monday with the Shanghai Composite (000888.SS), a key indicator of the overall performance of the Chinese stock market, rising more than 2%.\nSimilarly, China\u2019s benchmark CSI 300 (000300.SS) finished the day up just under 2% to recover from last week's lows. The index is up 25% over the past month on the heels of China unleashing its most aggressive monetary stimulus since the pandemic.\nRead more here. \nBitcoin (BTC-USD) is up more than 5% in the past 24 hours to touch above $65,700 per coin. The world's largest cryptocurrency has been surging in recent days and is now up about 8% over the past five trading sessions.\nOther cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also rallied, adding nearly 8%, in the past 24 hours. The risk-on rally in crypto is helping crypto-related US equities catch a bid too.\nShares of Coinbase (COIN) are the leader in the space today, rising more than 8%.\nTrump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended its massive rally on Monday, jumping as much as 9% as investors bet on former President Donald Trump's improved odds of winning the November election.\nOver the weekend, both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory, with prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showing Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris.\nSeparately, DJT announced the web launch of its Truth+ TV streaming service on Monday. The app is currently available to access on Android devices and will soon be released as a native Apple iOS app.\nDJT shares traded at their lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of the company's highly publicized lockup period last month. The stock has also been under pressure as previous polling saw Harris edging slightly ahead of the former president.\nTrump's recent campaign momentum follows an appearance by Elon Musk at his rally in Butler, Pa., earlier this month. It was the same location where the former president survived an assassination attempt in July.\nMeanwhile, Harris has recently embarked on a flurry of media appearances in which she was pressed on how she would fund some of her proposals surrounding the economy and immigration.\nRead more here.\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:\nMinneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari said Monday that it\u2019s \"likely\" the central bank will make \"modest\" interest rate reductions in the \"coming quarters.\"\nMonetary policy, he said while speaking in Argentina, remains \"overall restrictive,\" though how restrictive is unclear to him.\nThe job market remains strong, he added, noting that recent data showed that a rapid weakening in that market doesn\u2019t appear to be \"imminent.\"\nThus, \"It appears likely that further modest reductions in our policy rate will be appropriate in the coming quarters to achieve both sides of our mandate,\" Kashkari said.\nRead more here. \nTechnology and Utility stocks rose on Monday, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) up 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) up 0.6%. Both major averages were on pace to close at a fresh record high.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose the most among the major averages, up 0.7%.\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) stock jumped as much as 9% after the online lender announced a $2 billion agreement with Fortress Investment Group to expand its loan platform business. The segment refers pre-qualified borrowers to loan origination partners and connects lenders with borrowers.\nThe move reflects SoFi's strategy of diversifying from its roots in student loan refinancing.\n\"SoFi\u2019s loan platform business is an important part of our strategy to serve the financial needs of more members and diversify toward less capital-intensive and more fee-based sources of revenue,\" said Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi, in a statement.\nOf the Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, only six recommend buying the stock, while 10 have Hold ratings and three have Sell ratings. The stock is up nearly 20% from last year but far from its record intraday high near $27 upon its IPO in 2021.\nAnalysts see shares falling to $8.91 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) clawed its way into green territory by 10:30 a.m ET to hover at new intraday record highs. The blue-chip index had slipped as much as 0.3% shortly after the market open following a record close on Friday.\nMeanwhile the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6% Monday, on pace for another record close.\nNvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) saw shares of its US-listed equity rise more than 1% in early trading, with the stock notching a new record intraday price of $193.96 per share and rejoining the $1 trillion club.\nTSMC shares previously hit an all-time high above $193 each in July after the Taiwanese contract chipmaker reported second quarter earnings. That surge briefly put its market capitalization above $1 trillion before shares pared gains. The stock fell back to earth as investors weighed its high valuation multiples, geopolitical risks, and concerns over AI demand.\nTSMC last week revealed third quarter revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.6 billion). That beat the NT$748.3 ($23.3 billion) expected, according to Bloomberg data, as well as the company's prior guidance of $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion.\nSome 23 Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying TSMC shares, while only one analyst has a Hold rating. Analysts see shares rising to $216.59 each over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data.\nBoeing (BA) shares slipped more than 2% as investors questioned the crisis-hit plane maker's future amid job cuts and a strike that is now in its fifth week.\nOn Friday, the company said it will cut 17,000 jobs, or about 10% of its workforce.\n\"Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term,\" CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees posted on Boeing's website on Friday.\nAn ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company.\nS&P Global put the cost estimate of the strike that started on Sept. 1 at roughly $1 billion per month. Last week, talks between Boeing and IAM broke down, with the company withdrawing its contract proposal.\nNvidia (NVDA) stock jumped more than 2% at the open on Monday, surpassing its June record high close of $135.58.\nThe stock was a couple of dollars away from its all-time intraday high just past $140.76.\nThe major averages opened mixed on Monday as investors turned their focus to upcoming big bank earnings and other quarterly results from major companies.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.3% to eye a new record high. On Friday, the broader index ended above 5,800 for the first time.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 0.5% soon after the bell on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.2% from its Friday record close.\nEarnings season continues in full swing this week, with Citi (C), United Airlines (UAL), AI chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX), and American Express (AXP) among those expected to report.\nOil futures dropped more than 2% as OPEC cut its demand forecast for 2024 and 2025. Traders also reacted to a lack of detail from China's Finance Minister over the weekend on any large new stimulus spending.\nNvidia (NVDA) stock rose 1% in premarket trading to $136.22, putting the chipmaking giant on track to surpass its previous record closing price of $135.58 posted in June.\nThe AI chipmaker's shares have made substantial gains in October following a massive $6.6 billion funding round for ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, much of which will be funneled back to Nvidia. AI leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have cited furious demand for the company's latest Blackwell chips. Its stock is up 8% over the past week.\nNvidia's gains put it on track to once again claim the rank of No. 1 most valuable company in the world in terms of market capitalization. It currently holds the No. 2 position behind Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker's market cap stood at $3.3 trillion Monday, while Apple's was $3.46 trillion. Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia have traded places as the top three companies over the past year.\nNvidia is set to report earnings on Nov. 19. Wall Street analysts expect it to report revenue of $33 billion, up 82% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 90% of those covering the stock and tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Nvidia shares.\n"

        "Title": "AMD Launches New Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chips: Should Nvidia Investors Be Worried?",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The market for artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators is currently dominated by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which has built a technology lead over rivals and controls an estimated 85%-plus share of this space.\nHowever, fellow chipmakers, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel, are also trying to corner a piece of this lucrative market. AMD recently unveiled a new AI chip -- the Instinct MI325X -- claiming that it's better than Nvidia's current flagship H200 processor. However, shares of AMD sank following the announcement.\nRead on to discover why that may have been the case and check if AMD's latest AI chip should be a cause for concern for Nvidia investors.\nAMD points out that its MI325X data center accelerator is equipped with 256 gigabytes (GB) of HBM3E high-bandwidth memory that supports a bandwidth of 6 terabytes (TB) per second. According to AMD, its latest chip has 1.8x more capacity and 1.3x more bandwidth than Nvidia's flagship H200 processor, which is based on the Hopper architecture.\nAs a result, AMD claims that the MI325X offers 1.3x greater compute performance, theoretically, along with an identical advantage in AI inference on the Llama 3.1 and Mistral 7B large language models (LLMs). The company is on track to start the production of the MI325X from the current quarter and says it will be widely available in the first quarter of 2025.\nGiven that Nvidia's H200 processor offers 141GB of HBM3E memory at a bandwidth of 4.8TB/second, there's no doubt that AMD's new AI chip is superior on paper. But at the same time, investors should note that the H200 was announced nearly a year ago and started shipping in the second quarter of 2024. AMD's chip, therefore, is around nine months later to the market than the H200.\nOn the other hand, Nvidia is set to level up its game in the AI chip market with its next-generation Blackwell processors. The upcoming B200 Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU) is set to pack 208 billion transistors, as compared to the 153 billion transistors on the MI325X. More importantly, the B200 is reportedly manufactured using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's 4-nanometer (nm) 4NP process node, compared to the 5-nm process node for the MI325X.\nNvidia will be packing a much higher transistor count into a much smaller chip, which means that its B200 processor is likely to have more computing power and be more power-efficient at the same time. Also, the B200 is reportedly going to offer a higher memory bandwidth of 8TB/second. The good part is that Nvidia expects to \"get several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue\" in the fourth quarter of its ongoing fiscal year, which will run from November 2024 to January 2025.\nWhat this means is that Nvidia would have moved ahead of AMD by one generation by the time the latter's latest chip is widely available to purchase. As a result, there doesn't seem to be a strong reason for Nvidia investors to be wary of AMD's latest offerings. However, there does appear to be a silver lining for AMD investors.\nNvidia is running away with the AI chip market and seems on course to clock almost $100 billion in data center revenue in the current fiscal year. AMD, on the other hand, is expecting its 2024 AI data center GPU revenue to hit $4.5 billion, which pales in comparison to Nvidia's potential revenue from this segment.\nHowever, AMD doesn't need to beat Nvidia in AI GPUs to supercharge its growth. It simply needs to become the second-biggest player in this market, which AMD believes could be worth a whopping $500 billion in 2028. The company started selling its AI GPUs toward the end of 2023 and sold $6.5 billion worth of data center chips last year, including its Epyc server processors.\nThis year, the company has generated $5.2 billion in data center revenue already in the first six months of 2024, which is nearly double its data center revenue in the same period last year. At this run rate, AMD could generate nearly $10.5 billion in data center revenue this year, $4.5 billion of which will come from sales of AI GPUs. Assuming AMD could capture even 10% of the AI GPU market in 2028, it could generate $50 billion in annual revenue from this segment, which would be a big jump from this year's projections.\nAdditionally, AMD's MI325X processor could witness robust demand, as Nvidia pointed out on its previous earnings conference call that its H200 processors are expected to keep selling nicely despite the arrival of the new Blackwell chips. More specifically, Nvidia estimates that shipments of Hopper-based chips, such as the H200, are set to rise in the second half of the current fiscal year, suggesting that there's space for the MI325X, despite the arrival of more powerful processors.\nMoreover, AMD's growing presence in the AI GPU market is expected to boost its growth from next year. While the company's revenue is projected to jump 13% in 2024 to $25.6 billion, the forecast for the next couple of years appears to be even better.\nEven if AMD is unable to beat Nvidia in the AI chip market, it could turn out to be a solid AI stock in the long run if it manages to carve out a small niche for itself.

        "Title": "Wall Street Analysts Predict a 28.2% Upside in Nvidia (NVDA): Here's What You Should Know",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) have gained 8.3% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $117, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $149.99 indicates a potential upside of 28.2%.\nThe average comprises 40 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $90 to a high of $200, with a standard deviation of $18.61. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 23.1% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 70.9% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.\nWhile the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.\nBut, for NVDA, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.\nAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.\nWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?\nThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.\nHowever, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.\nThat said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nOver the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5%, as one estimate has moved higher compared to no negative revision.\nMoreover, NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much NVDA could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Nauman Khan ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA's (NVDA, Financial) RTX 40 series, particularly the mid-range RTX 4060 with its counterparts, continues to dominate the GPU market at a rapid pace, according to Steam's latest hardware survey. The RTX 4060 alone saw a staggering 34% rise in adoption from August to September, marking its most substantial monthly gain yet and propelling its market share increase to over 1%.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nThis significant upsurge contrasts with its performance between July and August when the RTX 4060 actually saw a decrease in market share. From June to July, there was a modest increase of just 0.45%. However, September's surge positions the RTX 4060 as a frontrunner in the global GPU arena, now holding a 4.58% total market share on Steam, closely trailing the RTX 3060, which leads at 5.86%.\nThe RTX 4060 Ti also made headlines with a notable market share jump of 0.76% in September, a 26% increase from the previous month. This boost brings its total market share to 3.66%, a rapid climb from the 2% increase observed from July to August.\nThese figures highlight the increasing preference for NVIDIA's mid-range models among gamers and tech enthusiasts, driven by their cost-effectiveness and robust performance. The RTX 4060 series' popularity could signal shifting trends in consumer behavior within the GPU market, favoring a blend of affordability and high performance. As NVIDIA continues to innovate, the dynamics of the GPU market may see further shifts, reflecting the evolving demands and technological advancements that define the sector.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates, October 10, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Core42, a G42 company specializing in sovereign cloud, AI infrastructure, and digital services announced an expansion of its Next-Generation AI Cloud offering by deploying NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs in the UAE.

        "Author": " Karen Friar    and Alexandra Canal    ",
        "Text": "US stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors reacted to downbeat earnings from ASML Holding (ASML) that dropped a day earlier than expected, sending chipmaker stocks lower across the board.\nShares of the leading semiconductor supplier sank more than 15% after its earnings, released in an apparent error, showed a disappointing sales outlook for 2025. Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell in tandem, dropping around 5% to slip back from their freshly minted high. AMD (AMD) stock also dipped 5%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged down about 0.8%, or more than 300 points, on the heels of closing above 43,000 for the first time. The blue-chip index was dragged down by UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which saw shares fall around 8% after its 2025 profit guidance missed estimates.\nMeanwhile, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) also dropped roughly 0.8% to fall from Monday's all-time high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank around 1%.\nInvestors also assessed a fresh crop of bank earnings before the bell with Goldman Sachs (GS) reporting a 45% surge in third quarter profit from a year ago, thanks to a rise in dealmaking. Similarly, Bank of America's (BAC) posted an earnings beat amid its own outperformance in investment banking.\nAs the rush of earnings starts to broaden out, hopes are for further positive surprises in what some on Wall Street suspect could be a tricky season. Shares in Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) finished the day up around 15% higher on the heels of its plan to shut 1,200 stores over three years, as the pharmacy chain pursues a turnaround.\nOutside of earnings, energy was another major focus. Oil prices tumbled roughly 4% on a report that Israel is prepared to refrain from bombarding Iran's crude and nuclear facilities in its response to an attack two weeks ago. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CL=F) sank to just under $71 a barrel, while Brent crude futures (BZ=F) fell to around $74.50 following the Washington Post report.\nUnited Airlines (UAL) reported third quarter financials on Tuesday that beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending the stock about 1% higher in after-hours trading.\nAdjusted earnings hit $3.33 per share in the quarter, while revenue rose 2.5% year over year to $14.84 billion.\nThe airliner also announced its first stock buyback since before the pandemic. It plans to purchase $1.5 billion worth of shares.\n\"I appreciate the entire United team coming together to take care of our customers by operating a safe and on-time airline this summer,\" United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said in the earnings release.\n\"As predicted, unproductive capacity left the market in mid-August, and we saw a clear inflection point in our revenue trends that propelled United to exceed Q3 expectations,\" he added. \"A prosperous summer 2024 is just the beginning as our improved customer experience combined with United Next positions the airline at the top of the industry for the foreseeable future.\"\nUS stocks closed in a sea of red on Tuesday, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which was dragged down by chipmakers including Nvidia (NVDA) and ASML Holding (ASML).\nThe Nasdaq Composite sank around 1%, while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) each dropped roughly 0.8% to fall from their previous all-time highs.\nOn Tuesday, in speech titled \"Landing Softly Is Just the Beginning,\" San Francisco Federal Reserve president Mary Daly called on a chart that showed the post-pandemic economic expansion could have room to run further.\nAt this point, the current economic expansion has been underway for 54 months, well short of the expansions that were seen starting in 1982, 1991, 2001, and 2009.\nWhile speaking at New York University on Tuesday, Daly noted that the Fed's work to achieve a \"soft landing\" isn't fully done, but the trajectory of the economy after inflation falls to 2% will remain just as important.\n\"We must strive for a world where people aren't worried about inflation or the economy,\" Daly said.\nDaly added, \"No matter which expansion you look at ... the message is the same. Sustained expansion helps all Americans.\"\nThis speaks to the growing conversation following the hot September jobs report about whether or not further economic expansion could impact the Fed's fight against inflation. \nDaly told Yahoo Finance that a pickup in labor market data isn't necessarily inflationary in and of itself.\n\"That's a fear more than a fact,\" Daly said.\nFor now, her check-ins with firms reveal that consumers are less willing to pay higher prices and customers are continuing to trade down and look for value. This would point to an economy that's still seeing consumers spending, but not necessarily one that's fueling a resurgence in inflation.\n\"This is not an environment where firms are looking to raise prices,\" Daly said. \"They're looking to grow, but they're not looking to raise prices.\"\nTrading in Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) was briefly halted on Tuesday due to volatility.\nShares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, suddenly plunged around 5% in late afternoon trading after extending previous gains by more than 13% earlier in the session.\nIt is unclear what exactly caused the abrupt drop in share price, although it was an incredibly high-volume trading session.\nThe former president spoke with Bloomberg News at the Economic Club of Chicago earlier in the day. He argued for more US tariffs, calling \"tariff the \"most beautiful word in the dictionary.\"\nIt's a big earnings week for markets, with United Airlines (UAL), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Netflix (NFLX) still left to report quarterly results.\nNetflix, set to report after the market close on Thursday, will have a high bar to overcome as the stock trades near record highs and analysts predict another price hike across its various streaming tiers.\nNetflix is expected to report earnings of $5.16 per share on revenue of $9.78 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. This would represent nearly 40% earnings growth compared to the prior year.\nInvestors have praised the company's foray into sports and live events. Meanwhile, its ad tier continues to gain traction. Shares have soared as a result, with the stock up about 45% since the start of the year.\nLast week, the stock secured another all-time closing high of around $730 a share. It's since retreated to trade closer to $710 a share. But the recent run-up has led to some apprehension on Wall Street.\n\"We expect Netflix\u2019s stock to trade higher on a US price hike announcement,\" Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a note to clients. \"But we would expect shares to eventually trade lower as investor\u2019s hopes for $25 in 2025 EPS are dashed.\"\nFor the full year, Netflix's earnings are projected to rise about 60% year over year to $19.10 per share, while full-year revenue of $38.75 billion would mark an increase of about 15% on a yearly basis.\nIn 2025, analysts anticipate full-year earnings to rise to $23 with revenue jumping to $43.46 billion.\nWall Street strategists keep growing more bullish on the stock market rally.\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, UBS Investment Bank equity strategist Jonathan Golub boosted his year-end target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2024 and 2025. Golub now sees the benchmark index ending this year at 5,850, from a prior target of 5,600. In 2025, Golub projects the S&P 500 will end the year at 6,400, up from a prior target of 6,000.\nGolub notes the economic backdrop is \"supportive,\" with growth data proving resilient, the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, and recession risk falling by the wayside. He sees further upside for the benchmark index as inflation falls, providing room for further easing from the Fed.\nGolub added that given the positive backdrop, in an upside scenario, small-business activity should \"improve\" this, leading to \"broad-based profit strength, loan performance and credit spreads driving valuations higher.\"\nApple (AAPL) stock hit a new intraday high of $237.49 on Tuesday, eclipsing its prior record of $237.23 on July 15. The stock's climb added about $70 billion to its market capitalization, putting it further ahead of Nvidia (NVDA) as the world's most valuable company after Nvidia's gains jeopardized the iPhone maker's lead.\nThe stock pared gains after notching the record, gaining about 1.5% in afternoon trading. Meanwhile, Nvidia fell around 4%.\nApple's upward move comes a day after preliminary data showed rising demand for iPhones in the third quarter. Global iPhone shipments rose 3.5% from last year, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC).\n\"While the growth of the Chinese players in emerging markets has been an ongoing theme this year, Apple also enjoyed a 3.5% YoY growth in shipments this quarter fueled by strong demand from the previous models and the launch of the new iPhone 16 lineup,\" said Nabila Popal, IDC's data & analytics senior director, in a statement Monday.\n\"Despite the staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence in markets outside the U.S., Apple will continue to grow in the upcoming holiday season,\" she added.\nApple released its new iPad mini, which is equipped to run its suite of AI features, on Tuesday.\nApple is set to report earnings Oct. 31, and Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg expect earnings to rise 9% from last year to $1.59 per share. Some 40 analysts recommend buying the stock, while 19 have a Hold rating and two recommend selling shares, according to Bloomberg data. Apple shares are up 32% from last year, and analysts see the stock rising further to over $245 over the next 12 months, Bloomberg data shows.\nNvidia (NVDA) shares sank more than 5% Tuesday, partially reversing its two week-rally and coming down from a record close the day before.\nThe stock's tumble comes after a Bloomberg report that Biden administration officials are considering capping US chip exports to certain countries. Citing unnamed sources, Bloomberg reported that potential regulations would focus on Persian Gulf countries in the interest of national security. The stocks of fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC) also fell, responding to the Bloomberg report and a dismal earnings report from semiconductor supplier ASML (ASML).\nNvidia stock has been more volatile since its 10-for-1 stock split in June, and news of heightened trade tensions focused on the AI chip sector \u2014 which Nvidia leads \u2014 have pushed shares down various times over the past two years. For example, Nvidia shares experienced a similar decline this time last year \u2014 when the Biden administration tightened export controls on US chips \u2014 before extending its historic rally.\nNvidia shares are up around 191% from last year.\nA surprise earnings report from ASML Holding (ASML) sent stocks lower across the board on Tuesday.\nShares of the leading semiconductor supplier sank around 15% after its earnings, released in an apparent error, showed a disappointing sales outlook for 2025. Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell in tandem, dropping around 4% to slip back from their freshly minted high. AMD (AMD) stock dropped 4%.\nThe moves erased prior gains of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which fell around 0.8%. As a result, the tech sector was one of the biggest laggards of the day, down nearly 2%.\nOil tumbled as much as 5% on Tuesday as supply fears faded after a media report signaled Israel would avoid targeting Iran\u2019s petroleum production. A glut of supply forecasted by the International Energy Agency also weighed on prices.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) dropped to hover near $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, fell below $74.\nPrices declined after a Washington Post article stated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Biden Administration Tel Aviv would avoid targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear and oil facilities when it retaliates for the ballistic missile attack earlier this month.\n\"Overall right now, its a bit of a bearish outlook for oil given china's economy and given Middle East tensions aren't escalating at this moment,\" GasBuddy head of petroleum analysis Patrick De Haan told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday morning.\nBoeing stock edged up close to 0.4% after filing paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday to issue shares of debt securities and common stock worth up to $25 billion over the next three years in a bid to generate much-needed cash.\nSeparately, the aircraft manufacturer said Tuesday that it has entered a $10 billion credit agreement.\nBoeing has had a chaotic year, beginning with a Jan. 5 incident in which an airplane part called a door plug blew off of one of its 737 Maxes \u2014 and set off a series of regulatory probes that revealed underlying safety issues at the company and led to the resignation of its CEO. Then, last month, 33,000 Boeing workers walked off the job, seeking access to pension plans, job security, safety improvements, and higher wages. The strike, which crossed the one-month mark on Sunday, has cost the company and workers an estimated $5 billion, according to a report by Anderson Economic Group reviewed by CNN.\nBoeing shares are down 42.6% from the start of the year.\nThe company is at risk of an S&P credit downgrade to junk, Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferr\u00e9 reports. Shares most recently slid last Friday after Boeing said it would cut its workforce by 10% and delay its first delivery of its 777X jet to 2026, Ferr\u00e9 wrote.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) index traded near its all-time high early Tuesday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose roughly 0.2%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dipped about 0.6% on the heels of closing above 43,000 for the first time as markets assessed a fresh wave of earnings.\nWhat's largely responsible for the drag on the Dow? UnitedHealth Group (UNH). The company saw shares fall nearly 10% after its 2025 profit guidance missed estimates.\nA fresh batch of bank earnings rolled in Tuesday morning, with strong quarterly results from Goldman Sachs (GS), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), PNC (PNC), and State Street (STT) lifting the market.\nHere are some of the highlights:\nHealthcare stocks moved in different directions following mixed results. Here's a look:\nNot to be outdone by Big Lots and True Value recently announcing they were going bankrupt, Walgreens (WBA) is back in focus today with its now-normal dose of bad news.\nThe drugstore chain said this morning it will close 1,200 stores over the next three years. That's a huge number, one that says a lot about the company's struggles over the last two years.\nThese numbers from Yahoo Finance shed further light on Walgreens' problems:\nAnother big morning for the banks on the investment banking front.\nGoldman Sachs (GS) delivered a 20% increase in its investment banking fees in the third quarter. Bank of America (BAC) also notched a 20% increase. Citi's (C) investment banking revenue grew 31%.\nLast week, JPMorgan (JPM) showed a 31% year-over-year increase.\nIs there a year-end advisory boom ahead of the November election as CEOs plot out their next five years? Could be. But there could also be a lot of companies preparing to IPO in 2025 amid near-record markets and the prospect of lower interest rates.\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 October 14, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Coca-Cola KO and Nvidia NVDA.\nKeeping your portfolio in shape is undoubtedly challenging, as things evolve rapidly within the investment landscape.\nBut the task can be more straightforward than some believe, as investors just need to demonstrate some initiative. For those looking to keep their portfolios in shape, let's look at a few pointers.\nBeta is a measure of a stock's systematic risk or volatility in comparison to the overall market. The S&P 500 is often used as the benchmark, with a beta of 1.0 representing the market average.\nA beta greater than 1.0 indicates that a stock is more volatile than the market, while a beta less than 1.0 suggests the opposite. Essentially, low-beta stocks provide a higher level of 'defense,' whereas high-beta stocks are known for their higher returns, or 'offense.'\nInvestors can use beta to help balance out their risk profile, helping during intense volatility spikes. A classic example of a low-beta stock is Coca-Cola, whereas high-flying tech stocks are commonly high beta.\nRegularly reviewing earnings reports is a crucial part of staying informed as an investor. These reports provide a wealth of information, from revenues and expenses to profits. By keeping up with this data, you gain a deeper understanding of the business and can spot any potential 'red flags.'\nIn addition, quarterly reports provide deeper insights into a company's strategy and plans. For example, the report may detail new products or services planned to launch or discuss plans for tapping into new markets.\nBy understanding a company's strategy, investors can evaluate its long-term growth potential with a higher level of ease. Nvidia's quarterly releases have been a great example of why investors can't fall asleep behind the wheel.\nThe \"Let Winners Run\" and \"Cut Losers\" strategy is simple: Investors should hold onto stocks that are performing well to benefit from their continued growth and compounding returns while selling underperforming stocks to prevent further downside.\nOf course, selling losers also frees up capital for better opportunities. The approach helps provide a portfolio that grows steadily over time by leveraging the strengths of successful stocks while minimizing the impact of the 'bad apples.'\nKeeping a portfolio in shape can be challenging, but it's certainly not as difficult when implementing some guard rails.\nManaging volatility, staying up to date, and letting winners run are all a recipe for portfolio success.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

What is still anchoring the market is big tech, even though their earnings themselves are kind of decelerating. Then seasonality comes into play. October is the weakest month, and you don\u2019t want to get ahead of that.\u201d\nAsked whether he does not believe the market really broadened out, Krishna said while there were some signs of market broadening, the \u201canchor\u201d of the rally remains big tech, which according to him, are just six stocks.\nMoving beyond the earnings and valuations debate, another factor still impacting investor sentiment is the Federal Reserve\u2019s next moves.\nTalking about the latest Fed minutes released October 9, \u00a0Wolfe Research\u2019s Stephanie Roth said on CNBC that a \u201csubstantial\u201d majority of Fed officials wanted a 50-basis-point rate cut. However, she said in the next meeting, a 50bps rate cut is \u201coff the table.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news. With each stock we mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nRawpixel.com/Shutterstock.com\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors:\u00a068\nAccenture made news after the company expanded its AI partnership with Nvidia.\u00a0 The deal includes launching a new Accenture division called Nvidia Business Group.\nNVDA CEO Jensen Huang also commented on the deal.\n\u201cAI will supercharge enterprises to scale innovation faster. Nvidia\u2019s platform, Accenture\u2019s AI Refinery, and our combined expertise will help businesses and nations accelerate transformation for greater productivity and growth.\u201d\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said the deal is setting the stage for AI\u2019s impact on the enterprise. \u201cThis major partnership will drive corporate AI adoption and signals the next phase of the AI revolution,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients. He highlighted the ripple effects expected across the tech sector.\nAccenture also impressed Wall Street with strong quarterly results. The key news here was $20.1 billion in new bookings, up 21% from Q4 2023. Management highlighted strong demand for its generative AI tools, signaling growth potential into 2025 and beyond. AI-related services now make up over 5% of the business after just one year.\nHigher profitability followed, with the Q4 operating margin reaching 15%, up 10 basis points from last year, thanks to cost efficiencies and tech investments. The company expects further margin growth.\nAt 28 times its fiscal 2025 EPS estimate of $12.77, Accenture looks attractive. This forward P/E ratio is below its 5-year average, suggesting the stock may be undervalued given its strong momentum.\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe largest detractors for the quarter were\u00a0Accenture plc\u00a0(NYSE:ACN) and CDW Corp, which both fell by around 14%. Accenture and CDW are currently experiencing flattish years in terms of revenue and earnings growth. This follows a period of post-pandemic elevated demand. We believe both companies continue to gain market share.\nOverall, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) ranks 10th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October.

        "Text": "The collaboration unlocks world\u2019s first Private 5G AI-RAN solution for smart cities on Vapor IO's Zero Gap platform\nAUSTIN, Texas, October 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vapor IO, the creators of Zero Gap\u2122 AI, announced today the deployment of the world's first private 5G artificial intelligence radio access network (AI-RAN) powered by the NVIDIA AI Aerial\u2122 platform with Supermicro in Las Vegas. The innovative solution, powered by Vapor IO\u2019s edge infrastructure, represents a massive leap forward in how telecommunications providers manage and optimize their wireless networks, all while creating exciting new revenue opportunities.\n\"Vapor\u2019s Zero Gap AI provides the automated infrastructure necessary to implement low-latency services, leveraging NVIDIA AI Aerial to enable voice, video, data and AI applications on a common platform. We have an operational business model that employs the principles of shared infrastructure to radically lower the complexity of deployment for our customers and partners,\" said Cole Crawford, CEO and founder of Vapor IO. \"And the city leading the charge? Las Vegas, which has signed up as the first live Private 5G customer for NVIDIA AI Aerial, is cementing its status as a major hub for wireless innovation.\"\nLas Vegas Leads the Charge\nWith this deployment, Las Vegas is showcasing its commitment to technology innovation and highlighting its ambition to be a leader in private 5G and AI for smart cities.\n\"We are thrilled to be collaborating with Vapor IO, NVIDIA and its ecosystem partners to bring the world\u2019s first private 5G-based AI-RAN solution to the City of Las Vegas,\" said Michael Sherwood, the city\u2019s chief innovation officer. \"This deployment marks a significant milestone in our journey towards becoming a smarter, more connected city. The AI-RAN solution will undoubtedly propel our smart city initiatives to new heights, enabling us to deliver improved services and a better quality of life for our residents and visitors.\"\nLas Vegas will use NVIDIA AI Aerial to deploy several thousand cameras across the city in 2025. This platform will allow Las Vegas to dynamically shift workloads between edge data centers and optimize performance in real time. Whether it\u2019s enabling application experiences, powering autonomous drones or supporting smart infrastructure, NVIDIA AI Aerial helps ensure that the city\u2019s network can meet any demand.\nWhat NVIDIA AI Aerial Is, and Why It Matters\nAt its core, NVIDIA AI Aerial is an open AI-RAN platform that delivers AI and RAN services on a common accelerated infrastructure, and optimizes network performance with AI. AI-RAN is the technology that will drive the next generation of wireless networks, moving from single-purpose to multi-purpose infrastructures that are AI capable and more efficient, while supporting industry standards for 5G, private 5G, Open RAN and 6G in the future.\nThis first deployment of private 5G AI-RAN in Las Vegas uses the NVIDIA Aerial CUDA-accelerated virtual RAN software stack and NVIDIA MGX\u2122 with GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip accelerated computing reference design along with Supermicro technologies. The collaboration with Vapor IO is key, as its Zero Gap AI edge infrastructure makes it possible to bring AI-driven compute power right to the network\u2019s edge. With this solution, the City of Las Vegas will be capable of handling some of the most demanding applications, enabling a wide range of new revenue streams.\n\"AI applications infused with private 5G networks can supercharge smart city initiatives, enabling cities to gather, analyze and act upon vast amounts of data in real time to enhance the city\u2019s experience. AI-RAN technology makes this possible, and this first deployment of private 5G AI-RAN solution using NVIDIA AI Aerial and Vapor IO showcases the extensibility of AI-RAN to various use cases,\" said Soma Velayutham, Vice President of Telecom at NVIDIA.\nNew Era of Scalable Network Monetization\nVapor IO and its Zero Gap AI platform offer a carrier-neutral, multi-tenant infrastructure to telecom, cloud operators, service providers and large-scale entities. Using this platform with NVIDIA AI Aerial, customers and partners are enabled to quickly deploy, operate and monetize their networks. For larger operators, Zero Gap AI significantly lowers the complexity of deploying nationwide edge services with pre-integrated solutions not normally serviced by internet backbones. With Zero Gap AI, customers and partners can deploy edge-to-edge, certifying once and deploying in multiple markets.\nAs shown with the first NVIDIA AI Aerial deployment in Las Vegas, Zero Gap AI\u2019s platform provides the foundation for bringing a service provider's platform to market. With Zero Gap AI as a foundation, AI-ready networks can unlock new revenue and product opportunities for a multitude of industries.\nThe Future Today\nDeploying the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform in Las Vegas with its private 5G AI-RAN capabilities for smart cities maps forward how cities, enterprises and telecommunication providers can optimize their networks for revenue. This collaboration lays the groundwork for AI and connectivity to offer network monetization through a turnkey platform built atop Vapor IO\u2019s edge architecture and Zero Gap AI solution.\nThe NVIDIA AI Aerial platform is available in Las Vegas to demo at Mobile World Congress, October 8 - 10, 2024 (MWC), where the city will host the world\u2019s top telecom innovators. The demo will feature live video inferencing on the MWC show floor.\nVisit the MWC Supermicro and Vapor IO shared booth 814.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI News You Should Not Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nThe AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification.\nAnother notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

The company recently revealed that Azure, the cloud service offered by the tech giant, is the first cloud unit in the world to run the new Blackwell systems made by chip firm NVIDIA. Blackwell is the latest AI-optimized system from NVIDIA that is the most powerful and efficient yet, but has been beset by production delays. However, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang revealed last month that the demand for the new chips remained insane and the firm was expecting billions of dollars in revenue from these chips in the fourth quarter. Per Microsoft, Azure is running Blackwell via the GB200 AI servers.\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Nvidia\u2019s CEO \u2014 yes, one person \u2014 is now worth more than all of Intel",
        "Author": "  Jacob Roach ",
        "Text": "Nvidia is one of the richest companies in the world, so it\u2019s no surprise that the company\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, is quite wealthy. The most recent net worth numbers from Forbes puts into context just how wealthy the executive really is, though. Huang has an estimated net worth of $109.2 billion, which is around $13 billion more than the market cap of Intel across the entire company.\nAlthough Nvidia makes some of the best graphics cards, the obscene amount of money the company has racked up over the past two years stems from its AI accelerators. In 2020, Forbes estimated that Huang was worth $4.7 billion, and even in 2023, after ChatGPT had already exploded onto the scene, the executive was worth $21.1 billion. Now, Huang is the 11th richest person in the world, outpacing Bill Gates, Michael Dell, and Michael Bloomberg.\nHuang and other Nvidia executives are making good on that value, too. Earlier this month, Nvidia executives sold almost 11 million shares, accounting for $1.8 billion. Huang aso cashed in $713 million in shares, according to Bloomberg.\nIntel, meanwhile, has its lowest market cap since December 2008, during the housing market crash. During that time, Intel\u2019s market cap dipped to $71 billion. The company peaked in early 2000 with a market cap over $500 billion, and it sat around $250 billion throughout 2020 and 2021. The dip now comes on the back of financial troubles within Intel, which has prompted shareholders to sue the company and Intel to split its Foundry business into its own subsidiary.\nComparing net worth to market cap isn\u2019t exactly one-to-one \u2014 and at some level, these two numbers themselves represent value more so than actual money. However, it puts into context just how massive Nvidia has become over the past year. Nvidia\u2019s market cap is over $3 trillion, making it the third-richest company in the world. Nvidia is worth more than Google and Amazon, and it\u2019s worth more than Walmart, Tesla, Visa, and Netflix combined.\nIt certainly helps that the top two richest companies in the world, Microsoft and Apple, have spent big with Nvidia over the past few years. Microsoft has been clear that Nvidia GPUs are the backbone of the infrastructure that built ChatGPT, and with AI continuing to be a hot commodity, Nvidia shows no signs of slowing down. However, the recent share sale from Nvidia\u2019s executives suggests the boom may not last forever.\n"

        "Author": "  Daniel Foelber, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms\u00a0hit a new intraday high on Oct. 4. Investments in artificial intelligence (AI) are paying off for its core advertising business, and its augmented and virtual reality projects could have potential to contribute earnings growth down the road.\nMeta is now the hottest stock in the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- a group of the largest tech-focused companies. But not long ago, Nvidia\u00a0carried the group higher. And Apple, which had been a significant market laggard earlier in the year, has staged a massive comeback and is up over 33% in the last six months.\nYou may be surprised to learn that every Magnificent Seven stock aside from Meta has been underperforming the S&P 500 over the last three months. The slowdown may be due to valuation concerns that earnings need to catch up with soaring stock prices. Another factor is the broadening of the market rally as stable stalwarts like Coca-Cola, Home Depot, and other blue chip components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average have been roaring higher in recent months and contributing the bulk of index gains.\nIt is useful to be aware of the gyrations of the broader market and major economic events so you know why a stock may be moving a certain way in the short term. But oftentimes, a lot of these movements are just noise and can distract from what investing is all about, which is putting your hard-earned savings to work in companies that can compound in value over time and maybe even return capital to investors through buybacks and dividends.\nHere's why the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK) is packed with compounding potential and is worth buying now.\nInvesting in an ETF can be freeing because it can smooth out individual stock movements by focusing more on a specific theme, sector, or investment objective. The fund can do well even as market leadership changes. It's less about Apple versus Microsoft\u00a0or Meta Platforms versus Google parent company Alphabet\u00a0and more about general industrywide growth.\nOf course, lower risk can mean lower reward because big gains in a single stock can only move an ETF by so much. But overall, the pros of ETFs can outweigh their cons, especially for investors who are looking for a hands-off tool. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is a bold bet on the top growth stocks, especially tech-focused companies.\nHolding\nWeighting in the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF\nApple\n13.5%\nMicrosoft\n12.7%\nNvidia\n11.3%\nAlphabet\n6.7%\nMeta Platforms\n5%\nAmazon\n4.5%\nEli Lilly\n2.7%\nTesla\n2.1%\nVisa\n1.9%\nMastercard\n1.9%\nData source: Vanguard Group.\nA whopping 62.7% of the fund is invested in just 10 holdings, which is a higher concentration than you'll find in an index like the Nasdaq Composite or the S&P 500, or even a similar ETF like the Vanguard Growth ETF. The Growth ETF has the exact same top 10 holdings as the Mega Cap Growth ETF, just less weighting in the top names and 188 total holdings compared to just 71 in the mega cap growth ETF.\nAt its core, the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is a bet on the continued outperformance of the most successful and valuable companies relative to the broader indexes. The Vanguard Mega Cap growth ETF has slightly outperformed the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 over the last 5- and 10-year periods due to the dominance of the largest market-cap growth stocks.\nThere's reason to believe these companies have what it takes to continue leading the broader market higher for years to come.\nMega-cap growth companies should continue doing well as long as they deliver on investor expectations. Solid earnings growth can justify a higher stock price and even valuation expansions. AI, cloud infrastructure, consumer spending, advertising revenue from social media, and enterprise software are all major trends that impact mega-cap tech stocks and are key drivers of earnings growth.\nRecently, Alphabet and Meta Platforms began paying small dividends to pass along profits directly to shareholders -- which is also a capital return strategy deployed by Microsoft and Apple. All four companies buy back a ton of stock to reduce the impact of stock-based compensation and avoid dilution. As these companies continue to mature, their dividends could become an increasingly important aspect of the investment thesis.\nWith an expense ratio of just 0.07% or $0.70 for every $1,000 invested, the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is an ultra-low-cost way to invest in the most valuable growth-oriented U.S. companies. Its top-heavy structure magnifies the impact of a single major holding. For that reason, the fund can be volatile if there's a sell-off in multiple top holdings. Still, it's one of those funds where investors know what they're getting. In other words, if the fund begins underperforming the market, it's probably because there's a sell-off in big tech.\nAll told, the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is an excellent way for long-term investors to target multiple top stocks without incurring sizable fees that can reduce returns over time.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Text": "In a bid to become the powerhouse behind the next generation of AI infrastructure, AMD has announced its latest accelerator and networking solutions.\nLaunching the products alongside the fifth generation of EPYC processors and the third generation of Ryzen processors, AMD has revealed Instinct MI325X accelerators, and Pensando networking engines: the AMD Pensando Salina DPU (for the front end) and Pensando Pollara 400 NIC (for the back end).\nSpeaking at the company\u2019s \u2018Advancing AI\u2019 event last week, CEO Lisa Su highlighted the importance of network infrastructure in the company's growth plan, as it looks to create optimised AI solutions at the system, rack and data centre levels.\nShe told attendees that \u201cputting together all of these world-class components designed to complement each other makes for great solutions.\u201d\nHer ambitions have been echoed by Forrest Norrod, executive vice president and general manager at Data Center Solutions Business Group, who said that \u201cAMD underscores the critical expertise to build and deploy world class AI solutions.\u201d\nThe Instinct MI325X is AMD\u2019s newest accelerator series was launched with the promise of the AMD Instinct MI350 accelerators to come in the second half of 2025. The Instinct MI325X accelerators are built on the CDNA 3 architecture, and will offer 1.8 times the capacity, and 1.3 times the bandwidth of Nvidia\u2019s H200, as well as 1.3 times the peak theoretical FP16 and FP8 compute.\nShipment of the accelerators are expected to be ready by Q4 2024, and will be available from a broad set of platform providers from Q1 2025. These will include Dell Technologies, Eviden, Gigabyte, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro.\nTalking about the future, Su said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to the continued optimisation effort. It\u2019s not just for the 300X, but also for the new 325X and upcoming MI350 series. We\u2019re excited about the compute memory uplifts we\u2019re seeing with these products.\u201d\nIn accordance with AMD\u2019s annual roadmap, the MI350 series will be unveiled next year. The product\u2019s improvements will include drive memory capacity, with 288GB of HBM3E memory per accelerator.\nThe Instinct MI350 accelerator series will be based on CDNA 4 architecture, and AMD expects that the GPU will offer a 35 -fold improvement in inference performance compared to CDNA 3 chips.\nAnnounced alongside the Instinct MI325X accelerators, AMD also revealed its networking solution: its Pensando platform for hyperscalers, split into two parts.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Palantir Technologies",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) have delivered stunning gains of 152% and 133%, respectively, in 2024, as both companies have been benefiting from the fast-growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software. That is also why both of them are now trading at expensive valuations.\nHowever, a closer look at their prospects indicates that Nvidia and Palantir's AI-powered growth is here to stay, as both of them stand to gain from massive end-market opportunities. Here, let's examine which of these two AI stocks investors should consider buying right now following their stunning gains so far this year.\nNvidia has been delivering robust growth quarter after quarter thanks to its market share of more than 85% in AI chips, which analysts at investment research firm Third Bridge believe is sustainable, thanks to the arrival of the company's next-generation Blackwell processors.\nNvidia's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended July 28) shot up 122% year over year to $30 billion. More importantly, the company's pricing power helped it increase its non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) gross margin by 4.5 percentage points last quarter to 75.7%. As a result, the growth in the company's bottom line outpaced its revenue growth.\nNvidia reported $0.68 per share in earnings in fiscal Q2, an increase of 152% from the year-ago period. And now, analysts at Japanese investment bank Mizuho have raised their sales expectations of Nvidia's AI graphics cards for 2025. Mizuho is expecting Nvidia to sell 8% to 10% more AI graphics cards next year from its prior guidance issued in July.\nThe company is expected to sell between 6.5 million to 7 million AI GPUs (graphics processing units) next year, driven by an improving supply chain that is expected to help it manufacture more chips. Given that Nvidia has reportedly priced its upcoming Blackwell processors between $30,000 to $40,000, which is identical to what it charges for its current generation flagship processor -- the H200 -- there is a solid chance its data center revenue could surge big time next year.\nAssuming Nvidia sells even 6 million of its AI GPUs in 2025 at an average selling price (ASP) of $30,000, it could generate a whopping $180 billion in revenue from the data center business next year. Moreover, its data center revenue could exceed $200 billion, at the higher end of Mizuho's shipment forecast. Given that Nvidia has generated close to $49 billion in revenue from the data center business in the first six months of the current fiscal year, which translates into an annual revenue run rate of $98 billion, investors can hope for another stellar year from this semiconductor giant next year.\nConsensus estimates are projecting Nvidia's revenue to hit $176 billion in fiscal 2026 (which will begin in January next year) from this year's level of $125 billion.\nHowever, if Nvidia can indeed manage to ship at least 6 million AI GPUs next year at the ASP discussed, it could very well coast past consensus expectations. As such, Nvidia could remain a top AI stock even after the stellar gains it has recorded in 2024.\nJust like Nvidia is the dominant player in the AI hardware market, Palantir has been touted to be the leading provider of AI software platforms by market research firms. Forrester, for instance, recognizes Palantir as a leader in \"artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) software platforms.\" Similarly, Dresner Advisory Services says that Palantir is a \"top performer\" in its AI, data science, and machine learning market study.\nWith the AI platforms software market forecast to clock an annual growth rate of 40% through 2028, generating $153 billion in annual revenue, Palantir seems to be on the cusp of a major growth opportunity. More importantly, Palantir's growth rate has started improving as more customers have started deploying its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) to integrate generative AI into their operations.\nThe company's revenue in the first six months of 2024 increased by 23% from the same period last year. Its earnings have shot up fivefold over the same period to $0.10 per share. For comparison, Palantir's revenue in the first six months of 2023 increased at a slower pace of 15% from the year-ago period.\nPalantir management made it clear on the company's August earnings conference call that its AIP is leading to stronger deal activity by attracting new customers, and by also helping it gain more business at existing customers. According to Palantir chief revenue officer Ryan Taylor:\nOne of the most notable indicators of our delivery is the volume of existing customers who are signing expansion deals, many of which are a direct result of AIP.\nThe strong traction of Palantir's AIP has encouraged the company to raise its full-year guidance to just under $2.75 billion from the earlier expectation of $2.68 billion. Analysts, however, are expecting Palantir to deliver $2.76 billion in revenue in 2024, which would be a 24% increase from last year. However, it won't be surprising to see it post stronger growth than that because of a healthy revenue pipeline that stands at $4.3 billion (its remaining deal value at the end of Q2, a metric that refers to the total value of contracts it is yet to fulfill).\nThe points discussed indicate that both Palantir and Nvidia are heading into 2025 with sunny prospects, thanks to solid demand for their AI offerings. However, Nvidia is growing at a significantly faster pace than Palantir. Also, a look at the valuation of the two companies, Nvidia turns out to be the relatively cheaper bet.\nInvestors should also note that Nvidia is possibly straddling Palantir's territory, as Nvidia has been witnessing solid traction in its software business. So, based on the valuation, the pace of growth, and Nvidia's moat in AI hardware and its focus on diversifying into the software side, it looks like the better AI investment of the two high-flying companies discussed here.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Title": "Why Is Wall Street Much More Bullish About Nvidia Than Palantir?",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "What a year it's been for Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR). Shares of the data analytics software company have soared 112%. Palantir was added to the S&P 500 in September. The company has announced major deals and partnerships with big names including BP, Microsoft, and Wendy's.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been an even bigger winner, with its stock skyrocketing 136% year to date. However, the giant chipmaker's shares are close to 14% below the peak set this summer. Investors have fretted about Nvidia's delayed launch of its new Blackwell GPU platform.\nDespite these concerns, Wall Street is much more bullish about Nvidia than Palantir. That begs the question: Why?\nGlobal financial markets data provider LSEG surveyed 60 analysts in September who cover Nvidia. Eighteen rated the stock as a \"strong buy\" (or equivalent rating). A whopping 37 analysts recommended Nvidia as a \"buy.\" The remaining five analysts viewed the stock as a \"hold.\"\nThe picture wasn't quite as rosy for Palantir. Of the 18 analysts surveyed by LSEG last month, only three recommended the stock as a \"strong buy.\" Another three analysts rated Palantir as a \"buy.\" Six analysts recommended holding the stock. Four rated the software stock as \"underperform\" while two others recommended selling Palantir's shares.\nWall Street's 12-month price targets for these two stocks further highlight the gap between them. The consensus price target for Nvidia reflects an upside potential of nearly 27%. The most optimistic analyst surveyed by LSEG thinks Nvidia's shares could soar another 73% over the next 12 months.\nIt's a much different story for Palantir. The average 12-month price target among the analysts surveyed by LSEG is roughly 25% below the current share price. The most optimistic analyst predicts Palantir could rise 37%.\nWall Street likes Nvidia more than Palantir for several reasons. The most important factor is the different perceptions about the two companies' growth prospects. To be sure, analysts believe both Nvidia and Palantir can deliver strong growth. However, Nvidia dominates its market in a more powerful way than Palantir does.\nAlthough Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs won't begin shipping as quickly as analysts would have preferred, they still expect Blackwell to be a huge commercial winner. I suspect some on Wall Street agree with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang that Blackwell will be the most successful product in the company's history.\nAnalysts also see Nvidia as having a broader market opportunity. Organizations in pretty much every industry and of all sizes are scrambling to develop artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, driving the demand for Nvidia's GPUs. Palantir arguably has a more limited opportunity, with more than half of its total revenue stemming from government contracts.\nNvidia's financial metrics are much stronger than Palantir's as well. In the second quarter of 2024, the company's revenue soared 122% year over year to $30 billion. By comparison, Palantir's Q2 revenue rose 27% year over year to $678 million.\nWall Street no doubt prefers Nvidia's valuation, too. The stock might seem expensive with a forward earnings multiple of 30.8. However, Nvidia's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio based on five-year growth projections is an attractive 0.93. Palantir's forward earnings multiple is a sky-high 87 with a PEG ratio of 1.88.\nI'm not sure if Nvidia's shares will jump another 27% and Palantir's shares will fall 25% over the next 12 months as the average analysts' price targets project. My hunch is analysts aren't super-confident about those price targets, either.\nHowever, I do agree with the Wall Street consensus that Nvidia is a better stock to buy right now than Palantir. If the demand for AI chips slows, Nvidia could be in trouble with its premium valuation. That doesn't seem likely at this point, though. With Blackwell on the way, I expect Nvidia will keep up its winning ways.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Each of the six publicly traded companies with a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion has played a significant role in the advancement and development of artificial intelligence (AI). Four of them have split their stocks in the last five years.\nIt might not be long before another AI stock-split stock joins the ranks. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has emerged as a key supplier of AI data-center chip designs, complementing its other semiconductor designs and enterprise-software business.\nWith its market capitalization around $850 billion, as of this writing, Broadcom needs to gain 18% to reach the $1 trillion milestone. Here's why it's bound to get there.\nBroadcom's roots are in semiconductor design, and it has developed a strong portfolio of intellectual property that has served it well in the AI arms race among big tech companies.\nBroadcom's networking chips are essential infrastructure for AI data centers. While Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) get all the headlines, it's Broadcom's chips that allow a company to get the most out of the billions of dollars it is spending on those GPUs. Broadcom's networking chips ensure data moves quickly and efficiently from one server to another, improving the efficiency of the data center. No company can compete with Broadcom's technology in this arena, and few customers would risk switching to a competitor due to the potential impact of using an inferior chip design and other switching costs.\nBroadcom also has a growing custom chip-design business fueled by AI spending. Broadcom designs Alphabet's tensor processing unit (TPU), which Apple used to train its Apple Intelligence large language model (LLM). It's also behind Meta's MTIA chips, which help train and run Meta's Llama model. Generative AI leader, OpenAI, is reportedly working with Broadcom for its own custom-chip designs as well.\nBroadcom isn't just an AI chipmaker, though. It holds a dominant position in wireless phone chips that improve 5G reception while extending battery life. It also makes WiFi and Bluetooth chips. Its chips are found in Apple's iPhone as well as in many other high-end smartphones.\nBroadcom has also made strategic acquisitions of enterprise software providers over the last few years, including Symantec and VMWare. It uses a land-and-expand strategy focused on selling multiple software solutions to a small group of large enterprise customers. That provides a growing and very sticky source of recurring revenue.\nBroadcom's networking chips are already essential infrastructure for AI. Over the next few years, more and more big tech companies will likely come to rely on its custom AI accelerators as well. Google and Meta are already spending heavily on custom silicon designed by Broadcom.\nAs AI development matures, investors can expect a greater focus on custom-chip designs like Google and Meta's. That's because these chips can be less expensive than general-purpose GPUs, and they use less energy for the same tasks. As a result, I expect them to account for a growing share of silicon in AI data centers.\nBroadcom's AI chips business is still a small piece of its operations, but it's growing extremely quickly. Its ethernet switching-chip sales grew more than 4x year over year in the third quarter, and AI accelerator sales grew 3.5x year over year. Both should continue to drive strong results for Broadcom into the future.\nBroadcom's stock currently trades for about 29.5 times earnings estimates for 2025.\nBroadcom should see improved earnings performance next year as it trims excess operating expenses related to its acquisition of VMWare in late 2023. Those trims should result in strong operating margin expansion. Even better, the long-term potential for operating leverage remains high even as its AI chips business scales and it builds its recurring revenue enterprise software business. Over time, Broadcom should see earnings growth outpace revenue growth.\nAI chips could drive extremely strong revenue growth over the next few years. And with improved operating leverage, it should produce the earnings growth needed to justify its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\nIn order to reach a $1 trillion valuation, Broadcom stock will have to reach a share price of about $214. That would put its valuation at roughly the same 29 times forward P/E at the end of next year based on current analysts' estimates. If Broadcom can outperform expectations, it might reach the $1 trillion milestone even sooner.\nBased on its current price and the current outlook for the business, it looks like the stock trades for fair value and could be worth a spot in your portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "It's amazing how much things can change in just 20 years. Two decades ago, industrial and energy stalwarts General Electric and ExxonMobil were the most valuable companies when measured by market cap, worth $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively. Jump ahead to 2024, and technology concerns are leading the way.\nTopping the list are three of the world's most recognizable tech companies. Apple leads the pack at $3.4 trillion (as of this writing). Nvidia and Microsoft are trailing close behind, with market caps of $3.1 trillion and $3 trillion, respectively.\nWith a market cap of just $1.9 trillion, it might seem premature to suggest that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has all the attributes necessary for membership in the $3 trillion club. However, the stock has gained 42% over the past year and 109% over the past five years, and its rebound appears poised to continue.\nRecent improvements in the economy, the company's strong market position, and its measured adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) could be the drivers needed to fuel Amazon's membership in this elite fraternity.\nThe past several years have been rife with challenges, not the least of which was an economic downturn fueled by decades-high inflation. There's been a vast improvement in recent months, however, as consumer sentiment in September reached its highest point in five months and the Federal Reserve Bank began its long-awaited campaign of interest rate cuts.\nThe improving economic conditions are favorably impacting Amazon's results. In the second quarter, net sales of $148 billion climbed 10% year over year, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.26 nearly doubled.\nHelping fuel the robust results were improvements from each of the company's major operating segments. Online sales in the U.S. increased 9%, while international sales climbed 7%. Perhaps most important was a reacceleration from Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- the company's cloud computing business -- which jumped 19%, its highest rate of growth since late 2022.\nEqually important is advertising -- the company's fastest-growing business -- which increased 20%, as Amazon is working to become a major player in the ad world.\nAmazon is the undisputed leader in the realm of e-commerce, which is an area it pioneered. The company accounted for 38% of U.S. digital retail sales last year, more than its next 15 largest rivals combined, according to data compiled by eMarketer. That dominance is expected to continue in 2024, with the company expected to nab 40% of online sales in the U.S. this year.\nThe company has long employed AI to maintain a competitive advantage over its rivals. Amazon uses AI to make product recommendations to customers and predict and maintain adequate inventory levels at its distribution centers and warehouses. The company also uses AI-powered robots to stock shelves and gather merchandise for shipping, and deploys these advanced algorithms to determine the most efficient delivery routes.\nAmazon is also the leader in cloud computing, another business it pioneered. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top provider of cloud infrastructure services, with 33% of the market in the second quarter, with Microsoft Azure at No. 2 and Alphabet's Google Cloud at No. 3, with 20% and 10% of the market respectively, according to research firm Canalys. Amazon offers one of the largest repositories of AI models for its cloud customers, which has helped reaccelerate its cloud growth.\nLast but certainly not least is Amazon's digital advertising business. The company displays ads on its e-commerce website, Prime Video, Freevee, Amazon Music streaming services, its Twitch video game streaming platform, and more. The company uses AI to help ensure the advertising reaches its target market. The results are undeniable, as advertising has been Amazon's fastest-growing business for several years running.\nAmazon currently boasts a market cap of roughly $1.9 trillion, which means it will take stock price gains of roughly 57% to drive its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Amazon is expected to generate revenue of $635 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Amazon would have to grow its revenue to roughly $998 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\nWall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth for Amazon of 11% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2029. It's worth noting that Amazon has grown its annual revenue by nearly 400% over the past decade, so those expectations could well be conservative.\nFurthermore, Amazon is currently selling for roughly 3.2 times sales, a slight discount compared to its average multiple of more than 3.3 over the past five years. That's a pretty attractive price to pay for a company with so many ways to win.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you\u2019d have $20,855!*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $43,423!*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $392,297!*\nRight now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee 3 \u201cDouble Down\u201d stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 7, 2024\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus News ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAs of 2024-10-14, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $67.34. It's currently trading at a price of $134.8. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -100.18%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$2.16\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.1%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 41.10% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n101.19\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n168.84\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n67.34\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $58.75. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -129.45%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Palantir vs. Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Two of the most popular artificial intelligence (AI) investments right now are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE: PLTR). These companies represent opposite ends of the AI investment spectrum, with Nvidia on the hardware side and Palantir on the software side.\nThese two have dominated their respective industries, but which is the better investment choice between them? Let's examine the evidence.\nFirst, let's break down their core businesses.\nNvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) and various pieces of hardware that support its GPU infrastructure. GPUs are the most popular choice for training AI models due to their flexibility. They can easily be configured to process intense calculations due to their ability to process multiple calculations in parallel. Combine that with the ability to connect thousands of GPUs together, and Nvidia's GPUs can rapidly train AI models.\nPalantir is on the application side of AI, with the basic premise of its software being data in and insights out. While Palantir serves both commercial and government customers, the biggest use expansion from its most recent round of AI product launches has been commercial clients. Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) gives its users the tools to integrate large language models (LLMs) into a business, allowing AI to become integrated throughout a business rather than being a stand-alone tool used on the side.\nPalantir and Nvidia sit on opposite ends of the AI investment spectrum, but their business case in both parts is quite clear. However, their financials are quite different.\nWith how popular an AI investment Palantir is, you may be surprised to learn that its revenue growth rate in the second quarter was only 27% year over year. Now, for most companies, 27% growth would be astounding, but with the pace of AI adoption and innovation, this may seem a bit out of place. Furthermore, there are other software companies that are growing at a similar pace but aren't focused on AI.\nStill, that doesn't mean Palantir is a bad investment. But investors need to understand that it's no Nvidia.\nIn Q2 of fiscal year 2025 (ending July 28), Nvidia's revenue rose 122% year over year to $30 billion. So, not only is Nvidia crushing Palantir in terms of raw growth rate, but it's also a far larger company, generating $30 billion in quarterly revenue versus Palantir's $678 million.\nAccording to Wall Street analysts, this revenue growth outperformance is also expected to last for the next couple of years.\nPer these estimates, investors can expect these growth rates:\nFiscal Year\nNvidia Revenue Growth Rate\nPalantir Revenue Growth Rate\nCurrent fiscal year\n106%\n24%\nNext fiscal year\n41%\n20%\nTwo fiscal years ahead\n17%\n20%\nData source: YCharts.\nThese are estimates, so they're not perfect, but it's fairly clear that Nvidia will outgrow Palantir, at least through the next fiscal year. However, the prices these stocks trade at are completely mismatched.\nNvidia is far cheaper from a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) standpoint, but that's not fair to Palantir as it's still working on achieving maximum profitability.\nTo help out this comparison, let's say Palantir can achieve 30% profit margins and grow its revenue at a 20% pace for the next five years. If it does that, it would trade at 45 times trailing earnings at today's prices. So, for Palantir to trade around the same price Nvidia is now, you have to give up four years of returns.\nThis shows how expensive Palantir's stock is and pushes me toward recommending Nvidia over Palantir in this matchup. Palantir is a fantastic company, but the expectations built into its current valuation are far too high. Instead, Nvidia looks like a much better buy than Palantir, as it will still be growing rapidly but trades at a far more reasonable price tag (even if that price tag is a bit expensive).\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.
