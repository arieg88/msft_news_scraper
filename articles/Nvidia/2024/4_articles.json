        "Text": "Technology stocks have been in high demand over the past year or so, driving the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite to new heights. The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to lead that charge higher.\nLike many investors, billionaires are intrigued by the potential to profit from these next-generation algorithms and have piled into AI stocks like there's no tomorrow. Recent research by The Motley Fool shines a light on the most popular technology stocks held by billionaire hedge fund managers.\nIt should come as a surprise to almost no one that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is near the top of the list. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been instrumental in facilitating AI processing, leading to triple-digit revenue and profit gains last year and headlines galore. What they might find surprising, however, is that two AI tech stocks are owned by more hedge funds, while another is neck and neck with Nvidia.\nLet's look at the three tech stocks -- not named Nvidia -- that are most widely held by billionaire hedge fund managers.\nResearchers at The Motley Fool examined 16 hedge funds that are run by billionaires to ascertain what some of the wealthiest investors had in their portfolios. The data was obtained by reviewing each of the funds' fourth-quarter 2023 13F forms -- the quarterly report filed by institutional investment managers with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the end of each quarter. The report discloses their portfolio holdings.\nThe study then compiled a list of the technology stocks that appeared in the top-10 holdings of more than one of the hedge funds reviewed. And the results were telling.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) topped the list, a top holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires:\nRenaissance Technologies (Jim Simons).\nBridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio).\nBlueCrest Capital Management (Michael Platt).\nMillennium Management (Israel Englander).\nTiger Global Management (Chase Coleman).\nE. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw).\nTwo Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel).\nThe Children's Investment Fund (Christopher Hohn).\nSoros Fund Management (George Soros).\nCaxton Associates (Bruce Kovner).\nViking Global Investors (Andreas Halvorsen).\nThe company's dominant Google Search gives it access to a vast treasure trove of data, which is needed to adequately train generative AI models. Its search business also forms the foundation for its industry-leading, digital-advertising business, capturing roughly 30% of the market last year.\nBillionaire Bill Ackman, who is also a fan, detailed the reasoning behind Pershing Square Capital's large stake in Alphabet: \"We continue to believe Google is one of the most advantaged and scaled players in AI with an unmatched business model.\" He went on to cite the stock's compelling valuation -- which is still attractive -- currently trading at less than 27 times trailing-12-month earnings, making it one of the best bargains among AI tech stocks.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) (NASDAQ: GOOG) also topped the list, a top holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires:\nCitadel (Ken Griffin).\nRenaissance Technologies (Jim Simons).\nBridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio).\nMillennium Management (Israel Englander).\nTiger Global Management (Chase Coleman).\nE. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw).\nTudor Investment Corp. (Paul Tudor Jones).\nCoatue Management (Philippe Laffont).\nTwo Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel).\nCaxton Associates (Bruce Kovner).\nViking Global Investors (Andreas Halvorsen).\nThe company boasts the world's most widely used family of social media platforms. About 3.2 billion people visit one of its sites every day, and 4 billion stop by monthly. This provides the company with a large horde of data. Meta surprised tech aficionados by developing its own Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which is now available for hire on all the major cloud platforms, representing an entirely new revenue stream.\nIts AI chops aside, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates recently addressed some of the market's most popular tech stocks, saying he views \"Alphabet and Meta as somewhat cheap.\" Dalio has a point, and that might help explain Meta's popularity among the billionaire set. Meta is currently selling for about 25 times forward earnings, a discount compared to a current multiple of 27 for the S&P 500.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) was tied with Nvidia, a top holding of 10 hedge fund billionaires:\nCitadel (Ken Griffin).\nBridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio).\nMillennium Management (Israel Englander).\nTiger Global Management (Chase Coleman).\nE. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw).\nTudor Investment Corp. (Paul Tudor Jones).\nCoatue Management (Philippe Laffont).\nTwo Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel).\nThe Children's Investment Fund (Christopher Hohn).\nCaxton Associates (Bruce Kovner).\nWhile Microsoft's software offerings and recurring revenue are no doubt appealing, the company has a big catalyst directly tied to AI -- namely, its generative AI-powered assistant, Copilot, a suite of helpers deeply integrated into the company's most popular products and services.\nCopilot streamlines a growing list of otherwise time-consuming tasks, helping users to be more productive. In fact, the initial versions were so successful Microsoft is rolling out a number of job-specific Copilots geared toward the sales, customer service, and finance industries, which will likely enjoy similar success.\nWe don't yet know how much this program will add to Microsoft's sales, but the numbers will likely be significant. Billionaire Dan Loeb of Third Points suggests the introduction of Copilot \"could increase [Microsoft's] revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne is even more bullish, suggesting Microsoft's generative AI efforts could produce incremental revenue of $143 billion by 2027.\nAt 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft isn't nearly as cheap as the other two stocks in our trio, but consider this: The company already has a clear path to profit from AI, which could be lucrative.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

It has since recovered a bit to $900 but is still off by 5% from the highs.\n\"This is a breather for Nvidia, as more investors are playing the 2nd and 3rd derivatives of AI across the semi and software ecosystem,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told me. \"We view this as a digestion period for the Street for Nvidia and nothing more.\"\nMaybe that will prove correct. Who knows?\nBank of America analyst Vivek Arya notes volatility in Nvidia is nothing new \u2014 the current sell-off marks the ninth time the stock has declined 10% or more since ChatGPT was launched back in late 2022.\n\"There are some market factors such as the recent rise in inflation, volatility (VIX), AI stock fatigue, rotation towards more cyclical sectors and possibly some pruning ahead of upcoming earnings season,\" Arya said. \"On a fundamental basis we have also heard of investor concern around rising competition and reducing lead-times (suggesting decelerating demand) for Nvidia GPU accelerators (though expected as new Blackwell demand grows).\"\nI happen to think Nvidia's stock sell-off is a near-term headwind to the broader markets that should be respected way more than it is. Arya gets at it a bit in his note, but it warrants further amplification.\nHere is a stock truly beloved by Wall Street and Main Street \u2014 for real, fundamental reasons such as the AI explosion powering demand for super chips \u2014 losing ground. It's one of the clearest signs yet that investors think stocks have come on too hard and too fast this year against a backdrop of higher for longer interest rates.\nMoreover, the price action suggests investors who are actively seeking new reasons to buy stocks at peak valuations are coming up empty. Now, they may simply be waiting to buy top names like Nvidia at cheaper prices.\nThat wait-and-see mindset is what the pros are doing with Nvidia's stock and other stocks with a high valuation but well-understood investment thesis.\nAnd it's not like we haven't seen Nvidia leading the broader market lower before \u2014 it happened last summer!\nEvercore ISI strategist Julian Emanuel correctly pointed out that Nvidia's stock did next to nothing from July 2023 to October 2023 (chart below). It ended up being the catalyst that brought the S&P 500 lower.\nBottom line: For the broader market to get its mojo back, its favorite stock has to get its mojo back.\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "Text": "It's no secret that artificial intelligence (AI) is the hottest game in town for investors. Much of the big gains for the stock market in 2023 and 2024 have been driven by surging interest in everything AI.\nNo company has been more at the forefront of the AI boom than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker's share price skyrocketed 239% last year and is up close to 75% this year. But is the enthusiasm about Nvidia beginning to fade? Maybe so. Two billionaire investors are selling Nvidia and buying another AI stock instead.\nDavid Tepper is known to many as the owner of the Carolina Panthers. However, he amassed enough money to buy the NFL franchise by achieving tremendous success with the hedge fund he founded in 1993, Appaloosa Management. Today, Tepper's net worth stands at $20.6 billion.\nTepper is bullish about AI. Eight of the top 10 holdings in Appaloosa's portfolio are AI stocks. Nvidia ranks as the hedge fund's fourth-largest position, but Tepper seems to think the stock's tremendous momentum could be near an end. In the fourth quarter of 2023, he sold almost 23% of Appaloosa's stake in the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker.\nHe isn't the only billionaire investor now noticeably less excited about Nvidia. Chase Coleman first made his mark in the investment world by working with legendary hedge fund manager Julian Robertson. Coleman next ran his own hedge fund, Tiger Global Management, which later expanded into venture capital. He's now worth $5.7 billion.\nTiger Global Management reduced its position in Nvidia in Q4 by nearly 13%. Nvidia still claims the No. 10 spot in the hedge fund's portfolio with a stake valued at roughly $480 million at the end of 2023. However, Coleman is taking some of his profits off the table with the stock after making big gains.\nBoth Tepper and Coleman saw Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) as a better AI stock to buy in Q4. Tepper's Appaloosa fund increased its position in the e-commerce and cloud-services giant by more than 5%. Coleman's Tiger Global Management upped its stake in Amazon by 24%.\nWhy are these two billionaire investors more bullish about Amazon than Nvidia? I suspect Tepper and Coleman might think Nvidia's valuation is now at a level where any sign of trouble could cause a steep sell-off. At the same time, Amazon appears to be building sustainable momentum.\nAI is definitely a key growth driver for Amazon. The company's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the top cloud-services provider based on market share. AWS is especially investing heavily in supporting generative AI development.\nAmazon is using generative AI internally as well. CEO Andy Jassy said in the company's Q4 earnings conference call, \"[W]e believe it [generative AI] will ultimately drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.\"\nOf course, Amazon isn't just an AI stock. The company's efforts to increase profitability in its e-commerce business continue to pay off. Amazon has delivered seven consecutive quarters of improving operating margins in its North America business segment.\nIt has also become a key player in the digital-advertising market. Amazon's advertising revenue soared 26% year over year in Q4. And that growth came before the company launched its ads on Prime Video.\nBuying more shares of Amazon has already paid off for Tepper and Coleman. The stock is up over 20% year to date.\nInvestors shouldn't sell Nvidia and buy Amazon only because two hedge fund billionaires have. However, it's not a bad idea to examine the potential reasons behind Tepper and Coleman's moves.\nI think the reasons Tepper and Coleman added more shares of Amazon in Q4 are still applicable now. The company's profits will likely continue to rise. AI and advertising remain strong growth drivers. Amazon is still an excellent long-term pick, in my view.\nWhen our analyst team\u00a0has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the pillars of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom is the semiconductor. And when it comes to high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs), \"Magnificent Seven\" member Nvidia is at the forefront of the discussion. But even as demand is soaring for the company's A100 and H100 chips, smart investors realize that there are other opportunities alongside Nvidia.\nConsidering that stock is up 200% over the last year, it might be worth checking out the competition and looking for a better value. Let's dig into three of Nvidia's primary competitors and assess why each company could be a good buy right now.\nIn early April, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) made waves with an announcement about its new AI chip, the Gaudi 3. According to Intel, the Gaudi 3 has 1.5 times faster training and inferencing power over Nvidia's H100. Moreover, the chip uses 40% less power than Nvidia GPUs, offering customers nice savings.\nAlthough Nvidia holds an estimated 80% share of the AI chip market, I'm cautiously optimistic that Intel can eat away at its rival's lead. Providers of IT architecture solutions -- including Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, and Super Micro Computer -- will all be designing systems that use the Gaudi 3. And Intel announced that early Gaudi 3 customers and partners include IBM and SAP.\nInvestors got a nice surprise during the company's first-quarter 2024 earnings report when CEO Pat Gelsinger said he now expects over $500 million in accelerated revenue in the second half of the year following the release of Gaudi 3.\nAlthough Nvidia is still the 800-pound gorilla in AI semiconductors, I see Intel's latest product release as an encouraging sign and am impressed by the initial success of Gaudi 3. With AI applications constantly evolving, I think Intel has a good chance to compete with Nvidia at a high level in the long run.\nThe second company on my list is Nvidia's closest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). As with Intel, Nvidia has a big lead on AMD. But this is not all good news for Nvidia, whose management has reminded investors that demand is outpacing supply, thereby creating a bottleneck for new business.\nThis is an opportunity for the competition to step in and take advantage. In late December, AMD announced its release of the MI300X accelerator. To date, this is the company's closest competing chip to what Nvidia offers.\nWhile it's still early, the MI300X launch has been encouraging so far. During the fourth quarter, the company's data center GPU business outperformed expectations by $400 million thanks to accelerated demand for the MI300X. Moreover, management believes that the addressable market for such chips will reach $400 billion by 2027.\nThe combination of early success for the MI300X and an enormous market opportunity in data center GPUs gives AMD the opportunity to gain some momentum on Nvidia and become a more prominent player in the chip space over the long run.\nI'll admit that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) might look like the most unconventional company on my list. Indeed, today the company is largely an advertising leader thanks to its large Internet surface area covered by applications such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\nHowever, as competition in social media heats up from TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, and others, Meta is demonstrating that its impressive cash pile is being used for lucrative new opportunities. During the company's first-quarter earnings call, investors learned that management expects between $35 billion and $40 billion this year in capital expenditures. This is a noticeable increase from prior guidance of $30 billion to $37 billion.\nThe reason behind the increased capex is Meta's efforts to build its own chips internally. The company's Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) chip could be a gold mine. First, a successful deployment of the MTIA would allow Meta to move away from its current infrastructure using Nvidia's H100 chips. This could lead to massive cost savings in the long run because the company would have its own customer chips and be less reliant on Nvidia over all.\nThe more subtle reason MTIA could unlock gains for Meta is that it provides a path for Meta to internalize as much of its tech stack as possible. The company is harvesting loads of data from its various social media platforms, so integrating its own chips into this workload could lead to more efficient operations as Meta seeks to continuously hone its targeted advertising capabilities.\nThe MTIA accelerator could be an enormous differentiator for Meta compared to peers, and I think it represents an entirely new source of growth for the company.\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was a $360 billion company at the beginning of 2023. It has added $1.8 trillion in value since then, and it's now the third-largest company in the world behind only Apple and Microsoft.\nThe heightened interest in artificial intelligence (AI) is the primary driver of that value creation. Nvidia makes the industry's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which developers use to build, train, and deploy their AI models. Those chips drove Nvidia's data center revenue to more than triple in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), and the momentum looks set to continue in fiscal 2025.\nNvidia is now using some of its newly acquired wealth to invest in other AI companies, which could hint at where the next wave of AI value is created.\nNvidia filed its first-ever 13-F with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 14, and it publicly revealed new holdings in five different stocks:\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), which develops voice recognition and conversational AI technologies.\nArm Holdings, which designs processors for the world's largest chip companies. This was Nvidia's largest investment with a value of $147 million at the end of 2023.\nNano-X Imaging, which is improving patient outcomes by using AI to enhance medical imaging. This stock was Nvidia's smallest investment with a value of less than $0.4 million at the end of 2023.\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, which is using AI to help with drug discovery.\nTuSimple Holdings, which developed an autonomous driving platform for the trucking industry.\nSoundHound AI stock has been the best performer of the bunch so far, with a 142% gain in 2024 already. It values Nvidia's stake at around $8.7 million, which doesn't sound like much, but SoundHound is only a $1.5 billion company.\nSo should investors follow Nvidia into the conversational AI specialist?\nMost of us are familiar with AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. They were originally designed to ingest text-based prompts, and they are capable of generating text content, images, videos, and computer code on command. SoundHound focuses on conversational AI, which is designed to recognize voice-based prompts and respond in kind.\nThat opens up a range of possibilities, especially in use cases where hands-free functionality is required. For example, restaurant chains use SoundHound's Employee Assist technology to help workers get fast answers to questions in high-pressure situations, like when they might be serving customers or completing operational tasks.\nSimilarly, SoundHound's technology is popular with automotive manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis, which use it to power their in-car virtual assistants. It means drivers can instantly retrieve information about their vehicle's functionality, in addition to weather forecasts, sports results, and information about local restaurants (to name a few capabilities).\nSoundHound recently announced a new partnership with Nvidia's Drive platform, which will allow car makers to deliver AI on the edge. That means drivers won't need network connectivity to use their voice assistant, which makes it available in more places and enhances data privacy.\nThe Drive platform is Nvidia's end-to-end solution for car manufacturers wanting to install autonomous self-driving capabilities into their new vehicles. Drive could become a key distribution channel for SoundHound's technology over the long term, considering it already serves many of the world's leading car brands.\nSoundHound brought in $45.8 million in revenue during 2023, which was a 47% increase compared to 2022. The company is still in the scale-up phase, although it did finish last year with a $661 million order backlog -- and that number doubled from the end of 2022.\nManagement's forecast for 2024 points to around $70 million in revenue, which would represent an accelerated growth rate of 54%.\nThat's great news, but SoundHound's bottom line warrants some concern in the near term because the company lost $91.7 million last year. While it's normal for small technology companies in their growth phase to lose money, SoundHound only has $95.2 million in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet, so it can't afford another year like that in 2024.\nThe financial picture outlined above makes SoundHound stock a risky investment relative to other AI stocks like Nvidia or Microsoft. There is a strong possibility the company will need a cash injection within the next year or two to continue operating, and that creates uncertainty.\nWith that said, Nvidia's investment in SoundHound stock is a big vote of confidence, and it could breed more unique deals like the one with its Drive platform. Plus, SoundHound's order backlog could lead to accelerated revenue growth in the coming years.\nBut remember this: Nvidia's stake in SoundHound is only worth $8.7 million. If it went to zero, it would have virtually no impact on the $2.2 trillion chip giant. It would be the equivalent of someone with a net worth of $100,000 losing $0.39 -- yes, 39 cents.\nNot only does the average investor have fewer resources than Nvidia, but they might also have a very different risk appetite. Therefore, buying SoundHound stock should be reserved for investors with a stomach for volatility, and the potential for losses.\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) became a hot stock last year when its shares soared 239% over the 12-month period. The company's chips became the go-to for artificial intelligence (AI) developers worldwide, leading Nvidia's earnings to skyrocket.\nIn 2024, Nvidia's stock has continued to hit new heights, with its share price up 76% since the market closed out 2023. The tech giant remains on a promising growth trajectory, with its business likely to benefit from the tailwinds of AI and other tech sectors for years.\nNvidia's meteoric rise has some analysts questioning how much room the company has left to run. However, its stock keeps defying expectations. Given the massive potential of AI and the chipmaker's dominating position in the market, I wouldn't bet against it over the long term.\nSo, here's why Nvidia stock remains a screaming buy right now.\nAs a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has a powerful position in tech. In addition to supplying its hardware to AI developers, the company's chips power a wide range of devices, from cloud platforms to video game consoles, laptops, custom-built PCs, and more.\nNvidia is the primary supplier to Nintendo's Switch game console, a partnership that has put the chipmaker's hardware into mainstream consumer use. The Nintendo Switch is the third-best-selling console of all time, selling 139 million units to date.\nHowever, the best reason to invest in Nvidia remains its AI prospects. Data from Grand View Research shows the AI market hit close to $200 billion last year and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030.  That projection would see the industry reach nearly $2 trillion by the end of the decade. There seems to be no end in sight to the soaring demand for AI GPUs, and that's good news for Nvidia.\nLast year, Nvidia's head start saw it achieve an estimated 90% market share in AI chips, leading to soaring earnings.\nIn its most recent quarter (the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. This monster growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales.\nAdditionally, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than chip rivals AMD's $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion. Despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia has more significant cash reserves to continue investing in its technology to retain market supremacy.\nLast year, Nvidia became the first chipmaker to achieve a market cap above $1 trillion. Its market cap is currently over $2 trillion, making Nvidia the world's third-most valuable company, after Microsoft and Apple.\nNvidia has come a long way in a short time, yet its stock has actually become a better value over the last 12 months based on price-to-earnings and price-to free-cash-flow.\nThe chart below shows that Nvidia's price-to-free-cash-flow and price-to-earnings ratios plunged in the last year, indicating its stock is at one of its best-valued positions in 12 months.\nP/E is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share (EPS). Meanwhile, the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio divides its market cap by free cash flow. These are helpful valuation metrics, as they take into account a company's financial health. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value.\nNvidia's plunging figures for both metrics make its stock an attractive buy given the bright promise for the business's future.\nNvidia has an exciting outlook for the coming years; estimates of its earnings per share (EPS) are optimistic.\nData by YCharts\nThe chart above shows that analysts think Nvidia's earnings could hit close to $36 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 35 yields a stock price of $1,260.\nIf it hit that number that would be a stock rise of 44% over the next two years. That would not replicate the stock's 2023 move, but would beat the S&P 500's 24% growth over the previous two years.\nNvidia still has much to offer new investors and is a stock worth considering right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in 2024, with shares of the chipmaker registering stunning gains of 70% so far this year as its artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled growth shows no signs of stopping.\nNvidia's revenue and earnings are topping Wall Street expectations. Even better, Nvidia is expected to sustain its impressive growth going forward thanks to its 90%-plus share of the AI chip market and an aggressive product roadmap. The company is set to launch even faster AI graphics cards that will allow its customers to train even bigger large language models (LLMs).\nThe stock's terrific surge also goes some way toward explaining why it is now trading at 74 times trailing earnings. That's substantially higher than the Nasdaq-100's trailing earnings multiple of 30 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). Still, there is a good chance that Nvidia will be able to justify its valuation thanks to the solid growth opportunities it is sitting on. The stock looks cheap when we consider the projected growth that it may deliver.\nEven then, value-oriented investors are likely to look for alternatives to Nvidia so that they can capitalize on the AI chip's market growth without having to pay an expensive valuation. This is where Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) comes in. Let's see why this chipmaker could turn out to be a solid Nvidia alternative for investors looking to benefit from the AI boom.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on Feb. 4), Broadcom reported total revenue of $11.9 billion, an increase of 34% from the year-ago period. Excluding the revenue contribution from VMware, which Broadcom fully acquired in November 2023, the company's revenue increased 11% year over year on an organic basis.\nThat points toward an acceleration in Broadcom's growth, considering that it ended fiscal 2023 with organic revenue growth of 8%. AI played a key role in accelerating Broadcom's growth last quarter. The company sold $2.3 billion worth of AI chips in Q1 of fiscal 2024, a 4x increase over the prior-year period. Broadcom's AI revenue displayed a significant jump from $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\nThe company now forecasts at least $10 billion in AI revenue in fiscal 2024, which would represent a quarter of its estimated revenue of $50 billion for the full year. Analysts were originally expecting Broadcom to end the year with $8 billion in AI-related revenue this year. However, the company seems to be benefiting from an increasingly strong demand for custom AI chips.\nMajor cloud computing companies are opting to make application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for powering their AI servers in a bid to reduce costs and boost efficiency. These companies are turning to Broadcom to make those custom chips. Meta Platforms and Alphabet are already its customers, and Broadcom recently revealed that it has won an additional customer for its custom AI processors.\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, custom chips could make up for 30% of the overall AI chip market by 2027 and produce an estimated $55 billion in annual revenue. This explains why Japanese investment bank Mizuho is forecasting Broadcom's AI-related revenue to increase to $20 billion a year by 2027. That won't be surprising as, according to JPMorgan, Broadcom enjoys a 35% share of the high-end market for ASICs.\nBroadcom stock has jumped nearly 19% in 2024. However, investors who haven't bought the stock yet should consider doing so soon, as it seems built for more upside considering the potential earnings growth it could deliver.\nThe chip stock is currently trading at 29 times forward earnings, which is lower than the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 30. Assuming Broadcom trades at 30 times earnings after three years and achieves $65.43 per share in earnings, as the chart indicates, its stock price could jump to $1,963. That would be a 48% increase from current levels.\nHowever, Broadcom could deliver even stronger gains, as its earnings could increase at a faster pace thanks to the growing demand for custom AI chips. That's why investors looking for an attractively valued AI stock that could deliver healthy appreciation should consider buying it before it jumps higher.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia has enjoyed being at the top of the artificial intelligence (AI) world for some time. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best-in-class for handling AI workloads, and many companies have purchased these GPUs by the thousands to set up their AI computing infrastructure. But these GPUs aren't cheap. Nvidia's flagship GPU, the H100, is rumored to cost around $30,000 to $40,000 apiece.\nThe margins on these units are quite impressive, which has driven Nvidia's profits through the roof. But when there's that big of a gold mine that one company is sitting on, challengers will surely arise to grab some of the market.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are two of the latest challengers, and their new products are sure to take over some of Nvidia's market share.\nMeta Platforms is better known by some of the social media companies it owns: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Messenger. These companies are essentially advertising platforms at their cores, so Meta devoted a large chunk of its AI resources to developing models that increase ad performance. Better products normally come with a premium price tag, so this effort could boost Meta's business over the long haul.\nBecause Meta's workloads are highly specific and specialized to the company, it developed its own chip, the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA). It developed this chip because GPUs (Nvidia's products that power AI model training) weren't suited to run their workloads optimally. This kind of product development to create a one-off chip infrastructure to optimize workloads could become an issue for Nvidia, as many of its largest customers have the resources to develop these products.\nFurthermore, Meta is directly challenging Nvidia with a new product announcement as it's also developing a next generation GPU. While the announcement didn't give much information about this product, it shows that Meta is gunning for some of Nvidia's market share.\nHowever, Meta's stock isn't trading like any of these investments will work out.\nAt 25 times forward earnings, Meta is still valued around the same levels as it has been for the past five years when it was just a social media company. As a result, you can buy Meta's stock for its advertising business and get the upside of its AI infrastructure developments for free.\nThat seems like a fantastic investment proposition, which makes Meta stock a strong buy.\nAlphabet is similarly challenging Nvidia. It recognized the same challenge Meta did: GPUs are not perfectly suited for AI workloads when the workload has been set up efficiently. That's why Alphabet created its tensor processing unit (TPU) and recently unveiled its fifth version.\nThis version integrates a CPU (central processing unit) and can achieve twice the performance of the last generation of a TPU. Google Cloud's vice president, Mark Lohmeyer, believes this will make it easier for customers to switch their workloads to Google Cloud. Unlike Nvidia's GPUs, which can be bought, Alphabet's can only be used by Google Cloud customers.\nHowever, this has been a promising proposition for many AI companies. Roughly 70% of generative AI unicorns (private companies worth at least $1 billion) are already Google Cloud customers. With that large of a key customer base already, it shows prospective customers the benefits of running their AI workloads on Google Cloud.\nAlphabet is in a similar boat to Meta, as it's only priced for its historical businesses.\nAlphabet's stock is fairly cheap with its trailing and forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio still below historical levels. With the potential for the Google Cloud business to improve thanks to better AI workload training hardware, there's still plenty of room for upside in the stock, making it a strong buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) minted its first $1 trillion company last year when Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock soared 239%, thanks to unprecedented demand for its AI data center chips. Nvidia continues to create value, and it's now worth $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world behind Apple and Microsoft.\nThe trillion-dollar club is incredibly exclusive, with Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms being the only other members. However, another company might be poised to join the ranks within the next decade.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is an emerging challenger to Nvidia in the market for AI chips. The company is valued at just $270 billion as of this writing, so investors who buy the stock today could see a gain of 270% if it does eventually join the trillion-dollar club. Here's why I think it will.\nLast year AMD unveiled its MI300 lineup of data center chips designed to process AI workloads. They come in two configurations: The MI300X is a pure GPU that competes with Nvidia's H100, and the MI300A combines GPU and CPU hardware to form an accelerated processing unit (APU).\nConsidering Nvidia can't keep up with demand for its chips, the door is open for competitors like AMD to snatch market share. In the fourth quarter of 2023 (ended Dec. 31, 2023), AMD told investors it was working with tech giants like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta on MI300 GPU deployments for AI. Microsoft has already begun private previews with customers for the MI300X on its Azure cloud computing platform, where developers can access advanced AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4.\nAMD predicts the MI300 series could attract $3.5 billion in sales in 2024. That forecast was revised higher from $2 billion just three months earlier, which speaks to how quickly demand is building. Nvidia did $47.5 billion in data center revenue last fiscal year, driven mostly by its H100, so there is still plenty of room for AMD to grow.\nHowever, AMD's opportunity in AI transcends the data center. It already has a 90% market share in chips for AI-enabled personal computers, led by its Ryzen AI series, which includes CPUs, GPUs, and neural processing units (NPUs). The company says millions of AI PCs have already shipped with those chips, from manufacturers like Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and HP Inc.\nProcessing AI on-device results in a faster user experience, because workloads don't have to travel to and from the data center. That allows computers to host advanced virtual assistants capable of creating text content, images, and videos potentially without any network connection. Ryzen AI chips sent AMD's Client segment revenue soaring 62% year over year during Q4, and investors should watch for more rapid growth in the upcoming first quarter of 2024.\nThe semiconductor industry is cyclical, which means growth is sometimes lumpy from year to year. Consumers don't upgrade expensive products like computers and smartphones annually, which leads to an occasional lull in revenue growth for companies like AMD.\nFor example, AMD's revenue soared 44% in 2022 to $23.6 billion, but it came in at $22.7 billion in 2023, which was a 4% year-over-year decline. High inflation and rising interest rates didn't help, because they piled additional pressure on consumer spending.\nCommercial spending on the data center presents the same challenge. Tech giants like Microsoft normally don't upgrade their hardware every year; however, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will change that in the near term. He says $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure will be upgraded within four years to meet demand for accelerated computing and AI, which could drive a significant growth cycle for his company and the likes of AMD.\nWall Street analysts are forecasting $25.8 billion in 2024 revenue for AMD, which will represent growth of 14%. They also predict $32.5 billion in 2025 revenue, which would be an accelerated growth rate of 26%. However, considering AMD recently lifted its own forecast for MI300 sales by such a wide margin, combined with its soaring sales in AI-enabled computer chips, it's possible the company blows Wall Street's numbers out of the water.\nAfter all, Nvidia routinely beats expectations in the data center, and AMD's MI300 sales are only just starting to ramp up.\nAMD is currently valued at $270 billion, and based on its $22.7 billion in 2023 revenue, its stock trades at a price to sales (P/S) ratio of 11.9. If that P/S ratio remains constant, AMD will have to generate $84 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation.\nThe company could get there within a decade if it grows revenue by a relatively modest 14% each year between now and 2034. AMD appears likely to meet the threshold comfortably in the near term based on the Street's forecasts for 2024 and 2025.\nPlus, despite the lumpiness in its yearly results, AMD's revenue has grown at a compound annual rate of 15.6% over the last 10 years -- and that's without AI, which could be the company's largest opportunity ever.\nMultiple expansion is also a possibility. If AMD's revenue grows much faster than analysts expect, investors could be willing to pay a higher P/S ratio for the stock. Nvidia stock, for example, trades at a P/S ratio of 35.8 -- triple where AMD stock is trading. That would accelerate the company's path to a $1 trillion valuation.\nAMD is a very likely candidate to join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the trillion-dollar club, and investors who buy the stock today could earn a significant gain when it gets there.\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) earnings have been soaring, climbing in the triple digits last year alone, as artificial intelligence (AI) customers flock to the company for its top-performing chips. As a result, Nvidia's stock has advanced, too, posting a gain of more than 200% over the past year. The company continues to pour investment into research and development, so it's very likely this industry star will stay in the lead.\nIt's no surprise that investors continue to pile into Nvidia stock, betting on more gains ahead, possibly in the near term and well into the long term. But is this stock really the best investment for you?\nAfter all, even if Nvidia remains in the lead, the stock may not replicate its past performance. Momentum could slow, or the stock's performance may stagnate as investors turn to other tech players ripe for an increase. So investing in Nvidia at this stage and hoping for enormous gains comes with some risk.\nYou have another option if you're looking for growth and hoping to score a win from the AI boom, though, and that's investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds shares of Nvidia and other technology players. One in particular, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX), has proven its strength in recent times. Should you buy Nvidia or this high-growth ETF?\nFirst, let's talk a bit about ETFs. These funds own shares of companies in a particular index or industry and trade like stocks, so you can buy them like you would a stock. But they come with an additional cost that's linked to the management of the particular fund. This is known as the expense ratio. It's best to select a fund with an expense ratio of 1% or less to limit your costs.\nThe advantage of investing in an ETF rather than in just one or a few stocks is it offers you exposure to a whole basket of stocks within a particular theme -- such as semiconductor companies, in this case. Your investment probably won't soar in the triple digits in a short period of time as certain individual stocks have done, but it's also less likely to sink in a short period because it doesn't depend on the performance of just one player. So it's a safer way to invest in a high-growth area such as technology or, more specifically, chip companies.\nNow let's consider the iShares Semiconductor ETF, versus an investment in Nvidia. The iShares Semiconductor has an expense ratio of 0.35%, so it fits our investment criteria. Its biggest holding is Nvidia, so it offers you exposure to this star player, and chip giants Advanced Mico Devices and Intel are within the top five positions. The ETF includes 30 holdings -- 78% are semiconductor companies and the rest are semiconductor equipment makers.\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the Nasdaq over the past year, though it has greatly underperformed Nvidia.\nConsidering we're in the early stages of AI and analysts forecast the AI market will surpass $1 trillion by 2030, this ETF could continue to soar well into the future and even beat the Nasdaq. But it may not beat Nvidia or any other single stock that attracts the market's attention.\nNow let's get back to our question: Should you buy Nvidia or this high-growth ETF? This depends on your comfort with risk and your investment strategy.\nIf your portfolio already includes a diversified selection of technology stocks -- including semiconductor players -- and you're an aggressive investor, you may want to buy Nvidia and bet on the company's next wave of growth. After all, it's preparing to launch the much-awaited Blackwell platform later this year, and that could drive more gains in earnings and share performance.\nBut if you're a cautious investor or haven't yet invested much in semiconductors, it's best to diversify instead of betting on just one player. The iShares Semiconductor ETF allows you to do just that, offering you exposure to all the top players right away and the ticket to benefit from their growth today and over time.\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has enjoyed a remarkable artificial intelligence (AI)-related surge since the beginning of 2023, and that's not surprising as the company is providing the critical building blocks needed for the proliferation of this technology.\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are helping its customers train AI models and deploy them, which explains why there is a huge demand for its chips. As a result, Nvidia's revenue and earnings have been growing rapidly in recent quarters, and the good part is that the company could sustain its impressive momentum as more AI infrastructure is built.\nHowever, concerns are that an eventual slowdown in AI chip demand could negatively weigh on Nvidia's prospects in the long run. That's why investors should consider buying shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) -- both Nvidia customers -- as these two companies could turn out to be bigger AI beneficiaries than Nvidia decades from now.\nJust like Nvidia, Microsoft has been one of the pioneers in the field of AI thanks to its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. This partnership has placed Microsoft at the forefront of the AI revolution in multiple fast-growing markets.\nFrom workplace collaboration software to personal computers (PCs) to cloud computing, Microsoft has been integrating OpenAI's expertise in multiple areas to capitalize on the proliferation of AI. For instance, Microsoft's Azure cloud business is now growing at a faster pace thanks to the improving adoption of the company's AI-focused tools, which allow customers to use its platform to build and deploy generative AI solutions.\nThis is evident from the fact that out of Microsoft's 53,000-strong Azure AI customer base, a third started using its services in 2023. Additionally, Microsoft management pointed out on the company's January earnings conference call that its Azure cloud business got a boost of 6 percentage points because of AI, clocking year-over-year growth of 30%.\nIt won't be surprising to see Microsoft's cloud business gaining more traction. That's because its customers can gain access to multiple large language models (LLMs) to build their AI applications without having to invest in expensive hardware. Grand View Research estimates that the cloud AI market could generate close to $650 billion in revenue by 2030. That's bigger than the $305 billion revenue that the AI chip market is forecast to generate at the end of the decade, indicating that Microsoft is sitting on a much bigger AI opportunity than Nvidia.\nThis, however, is just one of the many AI-related catalysts for Microsoft. For instance, the adoption of AI-enabled PCs could give Microsoft's growth a big boost in the future. According to market research firm Canalys, shipments of AI-capable PCs are expected to increase at an annual rate of 44% through 2028, hitting 205 million units at the end of the forecast period.\nMicrosoft is looking to capitalize on this opportunity with Copilot Pro, a subscription service priced at $20 a month that will give PC users access to AI tools in multiple applications such as Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint, enabling them to create images with generative AI prompts and gain priority access to popular LLMs. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that the market for specialized generative AI assistants could be worth $89 billion in 2032 as compared to just $447 million in 2022, which means that Microsoft's move to monetize its Copilot could help the company reap rich rewards.\nSo, even though Microsoft may not be matching Nvidia's stellar growth rate right now, it seems capable of delivering steady growth for a long time to come thanks to the growing AI adoption in multiple end markets that could turn out to be more lucrative than the AI chip space.\nThe good part is that Microsoft's growth rate is picking up nicely following the advent of AI. That's why investors will do well to buy this stock as it is trading at a reasonable 38 times trailing earnings right now compared to Nvidia's rich price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 73.\nDigital advertising is another industry that's expected to benefit from AI adoption, with advertisers using the technology to improve audience targeting so that they can enhance their returns on ad dollars spent. Bloomberg is forecasting generative AI-based ad spending to jump to $192 billion in 2032 from only $57 million in 2022.\nMeta Platforms is a top way to play this opportunity thanks to the growing popularity of the company's AI-focused tools and a huge user base. The company has been rolling out generative AI features for advertisers since last year and is claiming that they are driving solid improvements in advertisers' returns.\nMore importantly, the company is looking to push the envelope with new initiatives such as deploying its Meta AI chatbot to popular platforms such as Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which will bring its AI tools to a much larger user base. Meta AI is a generative AI assistant that answers users' queries and also allows them to create images with text prompts. Given that Meta ended 2023 with almost 4 billion monthly active users across its various apps, the company is sitting on a terrific monetization opportunity.\nAll this explains why consensus estimates are predicting an acceleration in Meta's earnings growth to an annual rate of 26% over the next five years as compared to 10% a year in the previous five years. Meta can sustain such healthy earnings growth for a longer period considering the multibillion-dollar opportunities in digital advertising and generative AI assistants.\nThis is precisely the reason why buying Meta Platforms stock is a no-brainer right now. It is trading at just 25 times forward earnings as compared to a trailing P/E ratio of 35, which points toward robust bottom-line growth. Also, this AI stock is cheaper than the likes of Nvidia and is trading at a discount to the Nasdaq-100 index's forward P/E ratio of 27 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks), giving investors all the more reason to buy Meta Platforms as AI could send this stock soaring for a long time to come.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Text": "There's no question that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the poster child of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution thus far.\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and Superchips are so in demand for cloud infrastructure companies and start-ups like OpenAI that there have been widespread shortages and a spike in prices for Nvidia components like the H100. Nvidia's products have formed the backbone of the computing infrastructure that makes apps like ChatGPT work.\nBut Nvidia won't have this space to itself forever. Competition is coming from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, as well as the big tech companies that make up a significant chunk of its customer base like Apple, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, which are working on their AI hardware to reduce their dependency on Nvidia.\nNvidia isn't a bad buy right now, but there is some downside risk in the stock since it's jumped nearly 500% since the start of 2023. That was evident when the stock fell 10% on April 19 on little more than fears of a bubble bursting in AI stocks.\nFor investors who want an AI stock that isn't at risk of a bubble popping, keep reading to see two that are well positioned for long-term growth.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been in the AI limelight ever since OpenAI launched ChatGPT. That makes sense. After all, Microsoft is a close partner of OpenAI, having invested an estimated $13 billion in the start-up, and Microsoft's AI strategy hinges on OpenAI's products and collaborations to a large extent.\nUnlike a hardware company like Nvidia, Microsoft has a wide range of ways to capitalize on the AI boom. It's integrated generative AI technologies into products like its Azure cloud infrastructure service, GitHub code repository tools, Microsoft Office suite, Bing search engine, and others. The company has rolled out Copilot, which it calls its AI-powered productivity tool, across a range of products, and CEO Satya Nadella said in the company's recent earnings report, \"Microsoft Copilot and Copilot stack are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry.\"\nMicrosoft may not have the explosive growth that Nvidia has delivered, but it's hard to doubt Microsoft's AI bona fides given its close relationship with OpenAI, dominance of enterprise software, and diversification across businesses like Windows, gaming, and cloud computing.\nInvestors cheered the tech giant's latest earnings report, sending the stock up after hours on Thursday after it easily beat estimates on the top and bottom lines.\nEven if Nvidia's growth suddenly slows, Microsoft should be an AI winner regardless of what happens in the chip sector.\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) doesn't get much attention in the AI sector. The company is best known for providing a comprehensive enterprise software suite to handle IT services and operations, as well as areas like customer service and human resources. But it's one of the biggest cloud software companies, and it's increasingly carving out a position for itself in artificial intelligence.\nServiceNow has been using more traditional AI technologies like machine learning and predictive intelligence, but it's also begun incorporating generative AI, using it for its Now Assist tool, which helps users generate code to speed up app creation and updates, and a Generative AI controller that can be used for things like content generation and sentiment analysis.\nGenerative AI is emerging as a key growth driver for the company, and CEO Bill McDermott said, \"Gen AI adoption remained on a tear in Q1.\"\nLike Microsoft, ServiceNow is also positioned to grow in a wide range of ways from AI, and the company has historically been a model of consistency -- it's grown revenue by 20% or more in every quarter since its 2012 IPO as its profitability has steadily improved.\nWith the exception of a few temporary pullbacks, ServiceNow has been a steady gainer on the stock market as well, and it looks primed to keep gaining as its competitive advantages are only getting stronger as it gains scale.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Text": "It's rare for a $2 trillion stock to fall on no direct news, but that's exactly what happened to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) today.\nShares of the AI chip leader got swept up in a broader AI sell-off after one analyst noted that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), another AI stock leader, failed to report preliminary revenue, casting doubt on its upcoming results.\nThat news caused Nvidia to fall 10%, while Supermicro lost 23.1% today.\nUp until this month, AI stocks had skyrocketed this year on blowout growth and excitement for the breakthrough technology. At one point, Nvidia stock had nearly doubled year to date, following another blockbuster earnings report in February, and its market cap topped $2 trillion.\nHowever, as this week's sell-off indicates, much of those gains were primarily driven by sentiment and a fear of missing out (FOMO) on the AI boom.\nWhen stocks have already made gains of several hundred percent like Nvidia and Supermicro have, it doesn't take much for those gains to unwind, and that seems to be what's happening here.\nA negative piece of news causes a little bit of selling, which leads to a flood as investors race to lock in profits before a potential bubble burst.\nThe observation that drove the sell-off could easily be a nonevent, as a Wells Fargo analyst noted that Supermicro did not give its customary preliminary revenue report, possibly implying that its quarterly results were weaker than expected.\nThat's entirely speculation, however, Investors should also be aware that an event like that wouldn't normally cause a stock to plunge 23% like Supermicro did, but it has been highly volatile and propped up in part by momentum and sentiment.\nAs far as Nvidia is concerned, the GPU maker is a close partner of Supermicro, but Nvidia is much larger, meaning it's not particularly sensitive to Supermicro's results.\nStill, sentiment in the AI sector tends to move these stocks in unison, and Nvidia has also benefited from enthusiasm and high expectations for AI, so it's not surprising to see the stock falling in line with Supermicro.\nIt's too soon to know if today's sell-off is meaningful. Keep an eye on Supermicro's Q3 earnings report, which is due out after hours on April 30, as that will confirm or reverse today's sell-off. Expect Nvidia to move in tandem with Super Micro Computer after that news comes out.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has popped 223% over the past year, catapulting the company to a $2.1 trillion valuation (only Apple and Microsoft are worth more). Nvidia makes powerful graphics processing chips (GPUs) for the data center that are designed to handle artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, and the company is overwhelmed with demand.\nBut while investors are (understandably) laser-focused on Nvidia, they might be overlooking other opportunities in the chip sector. According to The Wall Street Journal, analysts have a consensus overweight (bullish) rating on two other names: Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) and Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ: ACLS).\nHere's why following Wall Street's lead and buying shares of Micron and Axcelis might be an excellent idea.\nMicron is one of the world's largest producers of memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, which are critical in everything from smartphones to data centers. As a result, the company's opportunity in the expanding AI space is already proving to be multifaceted.\nFirst, Micron's latest HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) solution was chosen by Nvidia to power its new H200 data center GPU, which is the successor to its industry-leading H100. Micron's HBM3E memory consumes 30% less power than competing hardware, which makes it an obvious choice as data center operators seek to keep costs down. Unsurprisingly, Micron's high-bandwidth memory is completely sold out for 2024, and most of its 2025 supply has been allocated already.\nSecond, AI workloads are quickly migrating from the data center to computers and devices instead, which creates a faster and more intuitive user experience. The chipsets inside AI-enabled computers are called neural processing units (NPUs), and they require 80% more DRAM capacity than traditional chips. Similarly, Micron expects DRAM content inside mobile devices to double. That translates to more demand and more revenue for the company.\nMicron's chips can already be found in Samsung's latest Galaxy S24 smartphone, which it also advertises as \"Galaxy AI.\" It features a chat assistant, translation assistant, and new camera technologies, all powered by AI.\nMicron stock is already up 47% in 2024 and is trading near an all-time high. Investors were very pleased with its breakout fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Feb. 29). For Q2, it delivered $5.8 billion in revenue, a 57% year-over-year jump. The company appears to have fully recovered from a challenging landscape last year, when it grappled with an oversupply of chips.\nThe Wall Street Journal tracks 38 analysts covering Micron stock, and 27 have given it the highest possible buy rating. The company is forecasting an accelerated revenue growth rate of 76% in the upcoming fiscal 2024 third quarter (ending June 1), so there could be more upside ahead for the shares.\nAxcelis Technologies is often overlooked by investors because it doesn't actually produce any chips. Instead, it makes ion implantation equipment that is critical to the fabrication process. The Wall Street Journal tracks just eight analysts covering Axcelis stock, but the majority of them have given it the highest possible buy rating. It trades at a very attractive valuation right now, so investors might want to follow the Street's lead.\nThe electric vehicle (EV) industry is a significant source of demand for Axcelis, because it's the only ion implant company with complete coverage\u00a0for power device applications. Power devices regulate electric power in workloads with high currents, and chemistries like silicon carbide can help manufacturers deliver hardware that is far more efficient. In EV applications, that leads to shorter charging times and much further battery range (mileage).\nAxcelis expects AI to become an increasingly important source of demand, too. As I touched on in the section about Micron, AI requires significantly more memory and storage capacity than traditional computing workloads, and that means more complex manufacturing processes and more expensive chips.\nAxcelis generated $1.13 billion in revenue in 2023, which was a 22.9% increase from 2022. Its earnings per share (profit) jumped by an even more impressive 36.1% to $7.43. But it gets better, because the company is currently sitting on an order backlog worth a whopping $1.2 billion, so 2024 could be another strong year.\nAxcelis stock is up 390% over the past five years, even after accounting for the recent 46% pullback from its all-time high. Based on the company's 2023 earnings and its current stock price of $104.32, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14. That's a 56% discount to the iShares Semiconductor ETF, which sports a P/E ratio of 32.3, implying Axcelis is far cheaper than its peers in the chip industry as a whole.\nBased on Wall Street's consensus price target of $156, Axcelis stock could soar 50% from where it trades today. However, it would have to more than double just to trade in line with the iShares Semiconductor ETF. Either way investors look at it, there is a very clear case for potential upside.\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Micron Technology wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Let's time-travel back a decade. On April 29, 2014, Disney's Captain America: The Winter Soldier\u00a0was the U.S. monthly box-office champ, Tesla had just begun delivering its Model S cars to China, and Activision Blizzard (now owned by Microsoft) was two days away from revealing its videogame Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.\nThe above paragraph was meant not only to take you back in time but also to give you an idea of the diversity of artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) customers. All the companies mentioned use Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) for various applications.\nWith the stage set, let's answer the question: How much money would your Nvidia stock investment be worth now had you invested $5,000 in the stock a decade ago?\nHad you invested $5,000 in Nvidia stock on April 29, 2014, your investment would be worth about $990,485, as of April 29, 2024. This amount assumes you reinvested the modest dividends Nvidia pays. For context, the S&P 500 index (widely considered the best proxy for the broad U.S. stock market) would have turned your 5 grand into $16,410 over the same period.\nNow, let's dive into what drove Nvidia stock to its fantastic return over the last 10 years.\nNvidia was founded in 1993 and went public in 1999. So, a decade ago, it had been in business for 21 years and publicly traded for 15 years. On April 29, 2014, Nvidia stock closed at a split-adjusted price of $4.67 per share. Its closing price was $4.43 when adjusted for both stock splits (Nvidia has had five stock splits) and dividends.\nBelow is what Nvidia's business looked like in the quarter reported about a decade ago and in its most recently reported quarter.\nMetric/Topic\nQ4 Fiscal 2014 (Ended Late Jan. 2014)\nQ4 Fiscal 2024 (Ended Late Jan. 2024)\nGrowth\nRevenue\n$1.14 billion\n$22.10 billion\n1,839%\nAdjusted net income\n$187 million\n$12.84 billion\n6,766%\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS)\n$0.08*\n$5.16\n6,350%\nBusiness snapshot\nBulk of revenue came from gaming and professional visualization (pro viz) markets**\nRevenue breakdown by platform: 83% data center, 13% gaming, 2% pro viz, 1% auto\nN/A\nData source: Nvidia. *Reported result was $0.32. This number is adjusted for the 4-for-1 stock split in 2021. **Nvidia didn't break out its revenue at this time in the same way it does now.\nNvidia's revenue has grown tremendously. Its 1,839% revenue growth over the decade equates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 35%. Even better, its profits have soared at a much faster pace. Its 10-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6,350% equates to a nearly 52% CAGR.\nNvidia's data center platform has been the company's biggest growth driver over the last 10 years. It's more profitable than the company's overall business, which is why Nvidia's earnings have been rising significantly faster than its revenue over the last decade.\nThe data center platform's growth is being fueled by the rapid adoption of AI by companies and other entities. Nvidia is a huge beneficiary of this trend because it's the dominant supplier of AI chips for data centers. In the company's most recently reported quarter (fiscal Q4 2024), its total revenue surged 265% year over year, while its data center revenue skyrocketed 409%.\nNvidia's data center business had been growing at a fast clip for some time, but its growth exploded starting in calendar year 2023, thanks to generative AI. This new technology burst onto the scene in late 2022 when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot. Demand for this tech is so robust because it expands the potential applications of AI.\nAI is still in its relatively early innings.

Supply constraints for Nvidia could boost AMD\u2019s newly minted MI300X chip sales.\nHuang, the subject of a recent \"60 Minutes\" profile, told analysts that overall, \"our supply is improving.\"\n\"Our supply chain is just doing an incredible job for us, everything from, of course, the wafers, the packaging, the memories, all of the power regulators, to transceivers and networking and cables and you name it,\" he said.\nPeople may think Nvidia GPUs are like chips, but Huang said the Hopper GPU has 35,000 parts and weighs 70 pounds.\n\"People call it an AI supercomputer for good reason,\" said Huang. \"If you ever look in the back of the data center, the systems, the cabling system, is mind-boggling. It is the most dense, complex cabling system for networking the world has ever seen.\"\nMore AI Stocks:\nAnalyst unveils eye-popping Palantir stock price target after Oracle deal\nVeteran analyst delivers blunt warning about Nvidia's stock\nAnalysts revamp Microsoft stock price target amid OpenAI reports\nWhile Nvidia provides guidance one quarter at a time, Huang told analysts, \"Fundamentally, the conditions are excellent for continued growth in calendar \u201924, to calendar \u201925 and beyond.\"\n\"We now have a new type of data center that is about AI generation, an AI generation factory,\" he said. \"And you\u2019ve heard me describe it as AI factories. But basically, it takes raw material, which is data, it transforms it with these AI supercomputers that Nvidia builds, and it turns them into incredibly valuable tokens.\"\nUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri considered Blackwell when he raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $1,150 from $1,100 while keeping a buy rating on the shares.\nIn the wake of Nvidia's Blackwell launch, the analyst tells investors in a research note that the firm's supply chain work suggests the mix in 2025 may be much richer than the firm expected.\nDespite potential shipment timing concerns, the firm highlighted the continuation of robust demand for Blackwell and Hopper products.\nWhile Blackwell shipments are anticipated for December, UBS remains bullish on the sustained demand for Hopper, particularly emphasizing its strength ahead of a significant product transition.\nArcuri said the increased mix assumptions for Blackwell, driven by strong demand for GB200 server racks, indicate a strategic shift for Nvidia towards becoming a full-stack provider.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n"

In recent weeks, however, the stock has stalled, and investors are wondering what's to come.\nOne Wall Street analyst thinks investors are overthinking it.\nMelius Research analyst Ben Reitzes reiterated his buy rating on Nvidia stock while raising his price target to $1,125. That represents potential gains for investors of 28% over the coming year compared to the stock's closing price on Monday. The analyst points to expanding capital expenditures by the \"Big Three\" cloud providers and other big tech companies as evidence that Nvidia stock has further to run.\nThe analyst has a point. Microsoft and Alphabet each reported their first calendar quarter results last week, and both announced plans to increase capex spending to support cloud growth fueled by generative AI. At the same time, Meta Platforms said it plans to boost spending by several billion dollars for the coming year to \"support our AI road map.\"\nReitzes references the current AI \"gold rush,\" saying the large cloud providers \"are all spending ~20% more on chips than we thought over the next few years.\" He goes on to say they're \"spending like crazy\" now, hoping they can \"monetize like crazy\" later. \"Sometimes a no-brainer is a no-brainer,\" he wrote.\nIf you don't believe it, consider this: Nvidia is the leading provider of the GPUs used in data center processing where much of AI systems reside, with an estimated 95% market share. That dominance was evident in Nvidia's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28), as its data center revenue of $18.4 billion soared 409% year over year, driven by the build-out of data centers to support AI.\nWhile Nvidia stock is a bit pricey, selling for 35 times forward earnings, the company's triple-digit growth and market dominance make it worth every penny.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "It seemed inevitable that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock wouldn't keep up its torrid pace after more than tripling over the last year. The stock has finally begun to give back a small slice of those gains in recent weeks.\nThat downturn extended today after Barron's highlighted an analyst report that threw cold water on many investors' growth predictions for Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) computer chip sales. Shares dropped nearly 5% and were still down by 2.8% as of 1:30 p.m. ET.\nNvidia has been dominant in the supply of hardware and even software for the high-powered computing needs generated by the onset of so many AI applications. Megacap technology companies including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and even Tesla have been at the front of a long line of buyers.\nBut D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria thinks that's exactly why Nvidia shares will be heading lower. In a recent report, Luria explains that those big technology companies will soon be shifting spending to grow the production of in-house AI-related hardware. Luria believes that will lead to a \"significant cyclical downturn by 2026\" for Nvidia.\nThat thinking has D.A. Davidson expecting Nvidia shares to drop to $620 per share. That would represent a decline of nearly 30% from Monday's closing price. But investors should take that prediction in a larger context, too. Nvidia isn't just an AI chip company. And it could grow revenue in the coming years from its other segments, including autonomous driving technologies.\nNvidia's stock run certainly has been far and fast. Yet even with that price target prediction, Luria has kept a \"hold\" rating on the shares. For long-term investors, that's probably the prudent thing to do. A continued decline in the shares could even provide a good opportunity to own more.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jabin Bastian ",
        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 6.2% in the afternoon session after markets rallied, with the Nasdaq up 2.1%, while the S&P rose 1.1%, following strong earnings from big tech companies including Microsoft and Alphabet. Notably, the earnings highlighted the strong demand for AI solutions, including cutting-edge AI chips that power most AI applications. These chips are developed by Nvidia and its peers.\nFor example, during its Q1'2024 earnings call, Meta raised its forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year. The increased costs are related to the company's AI infrastructure. It also released its AI assistant, Meta AI. This product was rolled out across its family of apps and is powered by Llama 3, an open-source large language model that is a ChatGPT competitor.\nAlso, during its earnings, Microsoft noted that its operating cash flow was impacted by higher capital expenditures to support cloud and AI offerings, and guided for \"capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments.\" Lastly, Alphabet struck a similar tone, adding during its earnings, \"You can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures. This will fuel growth in cloud help us push the frontiers of AI models.\"\nOverall, the future looks promising for Nvidia as it continues to meet growing market demand within the AI space.\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 10 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago, when the company dropped 10% after major indices declined with the Nasdaq down 2.1% while the S&P 500 fell by 0.9%. Netflix reported mixed results to kick off the new earnings season. The video-streaming giant provided underwhelming sales guidance for the full year and guided for growth to decelerate in the second half of the year. Also, Netflix surprisingly announced it will stop disclosing subscriber count (starting in the first quarter of 2025), and this is contributing to the market's concerns about the business. The company's post-earnings stock decline is likely dampening the sentiment toward tech stocks.\nAlso, it was a challenging week for most risk assets following news of escalating tension between Israel and Iran, which increeased concerns among investors, given the potential disruptions to business supply chains, especially in the Middle East. These add to the ongoing inflation worries after the March 2024 CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) report revealed inflation came in slightly hotter than expected.\nOn April 16, 2024, Fed Chair Jerome Powell echoed similar sentiment, adding, \"The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.\" This suggests the Fed might not lower its policy rates as fast as anticipated in 2024, with markets pricing in fewer rate cuts for the year.\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\nNvidia is up 82.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $877.42 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $950.02 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $19,723.\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "Title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Are Taking the Fight to Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If there is one stock that exemplifies the potential to profit from artificial intelligence (AI), it would have to be Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company pioneered the graphics processing unit (GPU) that rendered lifelike images in video games. What makes these chips so effective is parallel processing, which takes computationally complex jobs and breaks them up into smaller, more manageable chunks. Nvidia was able to adapt this technology to handle the rigors of AI, making it arguably the most successful company in the AI chip space.\nHowever, as demand for AI has accelerated, numerous technology stalwarts have been working furiously behind the scenes to come up with viable alternatives to Nvidia's industry-leading processors. This week saw a number of announcements as rivals unveiled the fruit of these efforts.\nLet's take a look at three.\nEarlier this week, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) unveiled its latest AI chip, dubbed Gaudi 3, in a direct challenge to Nvidia's GPU dominance. The company claims that Gaudi can train AI models nearly twice as fast as Nvidia's H100 flagship data center processor and 50% faster for inference -- running AI models that have already been trained. The company also said Gaudi delivered all that performance with 40% better power efficiency than the H100 \"at a fraction of the cost,\" according to Intel.\nIt's important to note that Nvidia recently unveiled the successor to its H100, its Blackwell B200 AI GPU, which will begin shipping later this year. While Gaudi wasn't compared to the B200, the company said, \"We do expect it to be highly competitive\" against Nvidia's latest processor, calling Gaudi \"a strong offering.\"\nIntel is likely not looking to outperform Nvidia's most recent AI chips but rather offer enterprises a cheaper alternative. It's also worth noting that there's been an ongoing shortage of Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips, creating a bottleneck in AI adoption. Intel's latest offering could help alleviate the backlog.\nNot to be outdone, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) announced the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) v2, a custom AI chip that runs in the company's data centers. Meta announced that the latest version of its MTIA \"more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth\" of its predecessor. Early results suggest the new processor performs three times better than the first version.\nMeta noted that it's trying to provide \"the right balance of compute, memory bandwidth, and memory capacity\" with its latest chip. The company isn't using these chips for AI processing; at least, not yet. Meta is using the processors to improve the speed and efficiency of its ranking and recommendation systems, used to surface relevant content on its social media sites and target advertising.\nMeta is one of Nvidia's biggest customers, so if it is successful in its AI chip efforts, the company could reduce its dependency on Nvidia's AI processors.\nAt the Google Cloud Next event this week, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) announced the availability of Cloud Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) v5p, the latest version of its AI-centric processor. The company said its Cloud TPU can train large language models (LLMs) -- which underpin AI systems -- three times faster than version 4.\nAs is generally the case, Google's TPUs won't be sold but will be available on Google Cloud later this year.\nHowever, in a blog post, Google noted that it's expanding its Nvidia GPU capabilities with the addition of the A3 Mega Supercomputer, which is powered by Nvidia H100 GPUs. Google Cloud customers will also have access to virtual machines (VM) featuring Nvidia's Blackwell B200 and Grace Blackwell GB200 GPUs.\nGoogle also unveiled Axion, its first data center central processing unit (CPU), designed in conjunction with Arm Holdings. Google says Axion is 30% faster than the leading CPU, with 50% better performance and 62% greater efficiency than x86 chips from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).\nWhile Intel intends to compete directly with Nvidia for a piece of the AI chip market, Meta Platforms and Alphabet are developing their own AI chips for specific purposes, either in-house or for cloud customers. Furthermore, while Intel claims its AI-centric chips can compete head-to-head with Nvidia's flagship processors, Nvidia has already moved on and will soon be shipping the next version of its state-of-the-art AI processors.\nThis helps highlight Nvidia's enviable position in the industry -- its rivals are always playing catch-up. They claim to best Nvidia in terms of performance, but their bragging rights don't last, as Nvidia's next-generation chips are already on the way.\nIt's also important to point out that the market for generative AI is growing at a rapid clip, increasing the market for these cutting-edge processors. As a result, Nvidia will likely maintain its industry-leading position, even as rivals enter the fray.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) gold rush is in full swing, and Nvidia has been one of the biggest winners thus far. Its chips power the most advanced AI systems, including ChatGPT from OpenAI, and its share price rocketed 230% over the past year. But Goldman Sachs thinks software and services companies could be the biggest beneficiaries in the long run..\nSeveral Wall Street billionaires seem to be thinking along the same lines. The hedge fund managers listed below sold down their positions in Nvidia in the fourth quarter and reinvested capital in AI stocks that fit more neatly into the software and cloud services categories.\nIsrael Englander at Millennium Management sold 1.7 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 45%.\nSteven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management sold 1.1 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 66%.\nMeanwhile, Englander and Cohen purchased shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) during the fourth quarter, supercharged AI stocks that soared 84% and 170%, respectively, over the past year.\nAmazon reported fourth-quarter results that crushed Wall Street's expectations. Sales increased 14% to $170 billion, the third straight quarter in which growth has accelerated sequentially. That was primarily due to momentum in advertising and retail, but cloud computing sales also accelerated from the previous quarter. Meanwhile, GAAP net income improved to $1.00 per diluted share, up from $0.03 per diluted share in the prior year.\nAmazon is set to maintain that momentum given its strong presence in three markets. It runs the most popular e-commerce marketplace in the world as measured by monthly visitors, and the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe as measured by sales. Amazon is also the largest retail advertiser and the third largest ad tech company in the world. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services.\nThat puts Amazon on a glidepath to double-digit sales growth through 2030. I say that because the online retail, digital advertising, and cloud computing markets are projected to grow at annual rates of 8%, 16%, and 14%, respectively, during that period. Indeed, with those tailwinds at its back, Wall Street expects Amazon to grow sales at 11% annually over the next five year.\nHowever, Amazon could surprise Wall Street depending on how successfully it monetizes artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in its cloud computing business. The company has designed custom chips for AI training and inference, called Trainium and Inferentia. Those chips cannot outperform Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), but they are more cost effective in certain situations and could bring more business to AWS.\nAdditionally, Amazon Bedrock is a cloud service that lets businesses customize large language models and build generative AI applications. Likewise, Amazon Q is a conversational business assistant that leans on generative AI to search and summarize information from various internal and external data sources. The chatbot can also answer questions and automate tasks like writing blogs and social media posts. Collectively, those products could drive faster-than-expected sales growth for Amazon.\nShares currently trade at 3.4 times sales, a tolerable valuation if Wall Street's consensus is correct and a more reasonable valuation if the company manages to grow sales faster than 11% annually. Personally, I think Amazon is a worthwhile long-term investment as its current price.\nPalantir reported reasonably good financial results in the fourth quarter, beating expectations on the top line and meeting expectations on the bottom line. Its customer count increased 35% to 497 and the average existing customer spent 8% more. In turn, revenue rose 20% to $608 million, reflecting 32% growth in commercial sales and 11% growth in government sales. Non-GAAP net income doubled to reach $0.08 per diluted share.\nCEO Alex Karp commented on Palantir's AI ambitions in his annual sharholder letter. \"Every part of our organization is focused on the rollout of our Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which has gone from prototype to product in months. And our momentum with AIP is now significantly contributing to new revenue and new customers,\" he wrote. AIP brings support for large language models to Palantir's commercial platform, Foundry.\nTo elaborate, Palantir builds software that helps businesses integrate and analyze data, develop and manage machine learning (ML) models, and build applications that improve decision-making. Forrester Research has recognized Palantir's Foundry as a leading AI/ML platform. AIP enhances Foundry, such that clients can develop and utilize generative AI to improve business outcomes. For instance, one of the largest U.S. healthcare organizations is using AIP to generate shift schedules that consider employee preferences, decision costs, and demand predictions.\nIn other news, the U.S. Army recently selected Palantir to build its Titan ground station system, which uses AI/ML to rapidly process data received from sensors placed in terrestrial, aerial, high altitude, and extraterrestrial locations. The 24-month contract is valued at $178 million, so it will not significantly move the needle for Palantir, but it does highlight its versatility and the contract could lead to further deals with the U.S. government.\nGoing forward, the data analytics market is forecasted to grow at 27% annually through 2030. While I doubt Palantir will match that pace given its past performance and small customer base, the tailwind still has positive implications for the company. Wall Street expects Palantir to grow sales at 21% annually over the next five years.\nIn that context, its current valuation of 23.5 time sales looks expensive, especially when the three-year average is 17.8 times sales. Also noteworthy, Palantir currently carries a consensus sell rating among Wall Street analysts, and the stock bears a median price target of $20.50 per share, which implies 10% downside from its current price of $22.80 per share. I would steer clear of Palantir until the stock trade at a more reasonable valuation.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia acquires AI workload management startup Run:ai for $700M, sources say",
        "Author": "  Kyle Wiggers and Ingrid Lunden ",
        "Text": "Nvidia is acquiring Run:ai, a Tel Aviv-based company that makes it easier for developers and operations teams to manage and optimize their AI hardware infrastructure. Terms of the deal aren't being disclosed publicly, but two sources close to the matter tell TechCrunch that the price tag was $700 million.\nCTech reported earlier this morning the companies were in \"advanced negotiations\" that could see Nvidia pay upwards of $1 billion for Run:ai. Evidently, the negotiations went off without a hitch, apart from a possible price change.\nNvidia says that it'll continue to offer Run:ai\u2019s products \"under the same business model\" and invest in Run:ai's product roadmap as part of Nvidia's DGX Cloud AI platform, which gives enterprise customers access to compute infrastructure and software that they can use to train models for generative and other forms of AI. Nvidia DGX server and workstation and DGX Cloud customers will also gain access to Run:ai\u2019s capabilities for their AI workloads, Nvidia says -- particularly for generative AI deployments running across multiple data center locations. \n\"Run:ai has been a close collaborator with Nvidia since 2020 and we share a passion for helping our customers make the most of their infrastructure,\" Omri Geller, Run:ai's CEO, said in a statement. \"We\u2019re thrilled to join Nvidia and look forward to continuing our journey together.\u201d\nGeller co-founded Run:ai with Ronen Dar several years ago after the two studied together at Tel Aviv University under professor Meir Feder, Run:ai's third co-founder. Geller, Dar and Feder sought to build a platform that could \"break up\" AI models into fragments that run in parallel across hardware, whether on-premises, in public clouds or at the edge.\nWhile Run:ai has few direct competitors, other companies are applying the concept of dynamic hardware allocation to AI workloads. For example, Grid.ai offers software that allows data scientists to train AI models across GPUs, processors and more in parallel.\nBut relatively early in its life, Run:ai managed to establish a large customer base of Fortune 500 companies -- which in turn attracted VC investments. Prior to the acquisition, Run:ai had raised $118 million in capital from backers including Insight Partners, Tiger Global, S Capital and TLV Partners.\nIn the blog post, Alexis Bjorlin, Nvidia's VP of DGX Cloud, noted that customer AI deployments are becoming increasingly complex and that there's a growing desire among companies to make more efficient use of their AI computing sources.\nA recent survey of organizations adopting AI from ClearML, the machine learning model management company, found that the biggest challenge in scaling AI for 2024 so far has been compute limitations in terms of availability and cost, followed by infrastructure issues.\n\"Managing and orchestrating generative AI, recommender systems, search engines and other workloads requires sophisticated scheduling to optimize performance at the system level and on the underlying infrastructure,\" Bjorlin said. \"Nvidia's accelerated computing platform and Run:ai\u2019s platform will continue to support a broad ecosystem of third-party solutions, giving customers choice and flexibility. Together with Run:ai, Nvidia will enable customers to have a single fabric that accesses GPU solutions anywhere.\"\nRun:ai is among Nvidia\u2019s biggest acquisitions since its purchase of Mellanox for $6.9 billion in March 2019.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/24/nvidia-acquires-ai-workload-management-startup-runai/\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia will soar 21% to $1,000 as its new AI chip slams would-be rivals, Morgan Stanley says. It\u2019s among 10 stocks set to surge",
        "Author": "  Will Daniel ",
        "Text": "Morgan Stanley analysts have a few ideas for investors looking to pick winning stocks this earnings season. In a recent note, a team of analysts led by the investment bank\u2019s executive director of equity research, Michelle Weaver, highlighted 10 stocks with near-term catalysts from potentially strong earnings, new product releases, or other events that could spark a bull run in their shares.\nAlthough Wall Street\u2019s consensus forecast for first-quarter S&P 500 earnings per share predicts average growth of just 2.7%, Weaver and her team expect a \u201csequential recovery\u201d in earnings in the second quarter, followed by a second half \u201cexpansion.\u201d\n\u201cWe believe earnings growth is set for a healthier runway through 2024,\u201d they wrote, adding that, although earnings estimates haven\u2019t moved much over the past six months, \u201cinvestor confidence in the achievability of those estimates has increased.\u201d\nEven after surging more than 200% in the past 12 months alone, Nvidia emerges as a potential big winner this earnings season, according to Morgan Stanley\u2019s Joseph Moore. Moore has a buy-equivalent \u201coverweight\u201d rating on shares of Nvidia, and expects the stock to spike 21% to $1,000 over the next 12 months as it dominates its AI competition. \u201cNVDA continues to see strong spending trends in AI, with upward revisions in demand from some of the newer customers such as Tesla and various sovereigns,\u201d he wrote.\nMoore noted that there has been some \u201cnear-term anxiety\u201d surrounding Nvidia\u2019s transition from its older H100 generation chips to next-generation models. With a lot riding on sales of the new \u201cBlackwell\u201d AI chip, some investors feared that there could be a \u201cpause\u201d in Nvidia\u2019s revenue growth, but Moore said that his \u201cchecks show no such pause, as underlying demand is strong.\u201d\nDespite rising competition from Intel, Huawei, Samsung, and others, Moore expects Nvidia to maintain its market share. \u201cBlackwell generation pricing looks to make a strong competitive statement\u2014reducing enthusiasm for competitive offerings,\u201d he wrote.\nThat should allow the tech giant to beat consensus earnings estimates and report strong guidance for investors in May. \u201cInvestors ought to maintain outsized exposures to the generative AI theme, as compute demand remains strong and there are increasing signals pointing to a durable multiyear investment cycle,\u201d Moore concluded.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s team of analysts went on to highlight nine more stocks with buy-equivalent \u201coverweight\u201d ratings and near-term drivers that \u201cshould drive a meaningful move in each stock\u201d in their note. Here are their earnings season movers.\nPharmaceutical giant AbbVie has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past year owing to concerns over rising competition for Humira, a drug used to treat arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. But Morgan Stanley noted that Humira represents less than 10% of AbbVie\u2019s revenue and cited a few upcoming catalysts that could boost the company\u2019s stock price. Analyst Terence Flynn highlighted the potential for AbbVie to report rising earnings per share figures on April 26, and for a new schizophrenia drug to show promising results in an upcoming clinical trial in the second half of 2024. \u201cWe believe that growth from ABBV\u2019s ex-Humira business (primarily Skyrizi, Rinvoq, and aesthetics) is underappreciated and will drive the stock\u2019s multiple,\u201d he wrote.\nPrice Target: $196\n12-month Appreciation Potential: 15%\nMorgan Stanley tech analyst Brian Nowak expects Amazon to beat Wall Street\u2019s earnings estimates by a \u201csignificant\u201d margin in the first quarter. The company has been focused on efficiency and cost-cutting in its fulfillment and e-commerce businesses\u2014using robotics, reducing shipping distances, and implementing a number of other strategies that are starting to pay benefits, according to Nowak. \u201cWe see room for continued cost improvements as AMZN has multiple operational levers to drive North America and [International] cost to serve per unit lower,\u201d he wrote.\nPrice Target: $215\n12-month Appreciation Potential: 20%\nThe materials science company Corning, which produces specialty glass and other materials for scientific applications, is another potential winner, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall. The company has suffered over the past few years given weak demand for many of its products, particularly display glass. But, according to Marshall, industrywide LCD-panel-maker utilization rates, which give a picture of industrywide LCD-panel production, have outperformed the \u201cbearish assumptions\u201d of many. That means Corning has more potential screens for its glass sales than analysts previously anticipated.\n\u201cWe remain [overweight] Corning as we view it as a name well-positioned to participate in many mega-trends over the coming years, and where recessionary demand conditions are already well built into the price,\u201d she wrote.\nPrice Target: $3512-month Appreciation Potential: 10%\nThe financial-services giant Lazard should \u201cdeliver strong profitability\u201d over the next few years, owing in large part to an M&A rebound, noted Morgan Stanley\u2019s Ryan Kenny. Lazard made 59% of its revenues from advising on strategic M&A transactions between 2018 and 2022, according to Kenny. On top of that, the analyst said, there\u2019s a key catalyst that could drive share prices higher in the near to medium term. \u201cLazard\u2019s recent C-Corp conversion, completed in January 2024, should drive a multiple re-rating over time as newly eligible investors increase exposure to the stock,\u201d he explained.\nPrice Target: $5812-month Appreciation Potential: 46%\nLifeStance Health Group, which offers online psychiatry and therapy services, beat all of Wall Street\u2019s earnings estimates in the fourth quarter, but the stock has fallen 10% since. Morgan Stanley\u2019s Craig Hettenbach believes that\u2019s a mistake, and investors are \u201coverlooking solid fundamentals and improving execution.\u201d The analyst predicts another strong showing in LifeStance\u2019s first-quarter earnings report in mid-May, which, he says, will serve as a catalyst for share prices, along with rising population-wide demand for mental health services.\nPrice Target: $1012-month Appreciation Potential: 67%\nPaccar, which sells commercial trucks through well-known subsidiaries like Peterbilt and Kenworth, has soared more than 50% over the past 12 months amid stronger than forecast demand for commercial vehicles. Morgan Stanley\u2019s Angel Castillo expects that run of performance to continue, even as truck sales decline slightly, owing to rising tractor orders. The analyst said he also believes the ongoing \u201ccommercial vehicle upcycle is only beginning.\u201d He went on to highlight Paccar\u2019s April 30 earnings, as well as the release of its preliminary truck order data on May 2, as potential positive catalysts for the stock.\nPrice Target: $14712-month Appreciation Potential: 30%\nThe financial information, ratings, and analysis giant S&P Global will beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates when it reports earnings on April 25, the result of \u201cstrong credit capital markets activity in the quarter and higher equity prices,\u201d according to Morgan Stanley\u2019s Toni Kaplan. The analyst pointed to the earnings report as a potential catalyst for further stock price appreciation, forecasting 55% year-over-year revenue growth in S&P Global\u2019s transactional ratings business, compared with consensus estimates of just 34%.\n\u201cWe view SPGI as a leading information services provider with a unique position among peers to expand in high-growth areas,\u201d Kaplan wrote, highlighting the potential for \u201cgreater synergies\u201d from its recent merger with fellow data provider IHS Markit.\nPrice Target: $50012-month Appreciation Potential: 20%\nSBA Communications, a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates wireless communications infrastructure, is set to benefit from strong earnings on April 29 after providing \u201cconservative\u201d guidance to investors, according to Morgan Stanley\u2019s Simon Flannery. The analysts said that SBA Communications is still benefiting from the 5G investment cycle, noting that only 50% of 5G tower sites have been upgraded with the more modern mid-band 5G tech.\nFlannery highlighted the extension of SBA Communications\u2019 buyback program, potential M&A activity, and interest rate cuts, as well as the defensive nature of communications infrastructure stocks, as positive catalysts for its stock moving forward. \u201cFundamentals for SBA remain strong, backed by secular tailwinds from growth in U.S. mobile data at ~18% annually over the next six years,\u201d he added.\nPrice Target: $24312-month Appreciation Potential: 22%\nThe data storage company Seagate Technology should beat Wall Street\u2019s earnings forecasts when it reports earnings April 23, according to Morgan Stanley\u2019s Erik Woodring. The analyst noted that intra-quarter \u201cchecks\u201d on Seagate showed rising hard drive disk production. \u201cAfter a nearly two-year downcycle, it\u2019s become clearer that the [hard drive disk] market is entering a gradual cyclical recovery, and moving into a period of AI-driven storage demand growth,\u201d he wrote.\nPrice Target: $11512-month Appreciation Potential: 31%\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Is Nvidia or Super Micro Computer the Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In the world of artificial intelligence (AI) investing, few stocks have been better recently than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). These two have had a phenomenal 2024 so far, with Super Micro Computer (often called Supermicro) up over 250% and Nvidia up by 80%.\nBut that performance becomes even more impressive if you backdate to the start of 2023, as Supermciro and Nvidia are up an astounding 1,160% and 520%, respectively. That level of performance might have investors wondering if there's room for more. If there is, the next obvious question is, \"Which one should I buy?\"\nSo, between the two, which is the better AI stock to buy today? Let's find out.\nThese two companies aren't competitors; they are complementary. Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) -- computing hardware that specializes in effectively processing intense calculations. These devices have been used for gaming graphics, engineering simulations, cryptocurrency mining, AI model training, and practically every other use that would require significant computing power to process.\nFortunately for Nvidia, most users (besides gamers) don't just have a single GPU. They buy hundreds or thousands of them and connect them to form supercomputers often housed in servers at a data center.\nHowever, haphazardly linking them together will not result in an optimized computing experience, which is where Supermicro comes in.\nSupermicro specializes in server design and has separated itself from competitors by offering highly customizable products that can be designed for workload type and size. Furthermore, Supermicro works closely with Nvidia to ensure its servers have been designed in an optimized manner so the end-user gets the most use out of their product.\nThis brings up the first difference: Supermicro has less differentiating technology. While Nvidia's GPUs are market-leading, Supermicro relies on industry knowledge and customization to separate itself from competitors. This can be a sustainable advantage, but it's less sustainable than having superior technology.\nAnother difference is that Supermicro is essentially an Nvidia reseller. It takes Nvidia's GPUs and other components to make its servers and then sells them to its clients. Because it cannot control the GPU pricing (the most significant cost of the server), Supermicro's margins are much slimmer than Nvidia's.\nOnce again, this is just a differentiating factor. Plenty of businesses have succeeded with much lower margins.\nBut when it all adds up, my lean starts to go in Nvidia's direction due to its technological prowess and higher margins. Additionally, when I look at each stock's valuation, Nvidia also looks to have an advantage there.\nAfter these two stocks' incredible runs, valuing them can be difficult. Trailing metrics aren't useful, as they are still undergoing massive changes (both Supermicro and Nvidia grew revenue by over 100% in their latest results). As a result, I'll use a forward-facing metric like the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value the companies.\nForward metrics have their issues, as they utilize analyst projections to value a company, which isn't an exact science. Still, it's arguably the best way to value these businesses, but Supermicro certainly comes with a price premium over Nvidia on this basis.\nThis makes sense, as Supermicro's boom is just beginning, while Nvidia's is starting to mature (even though Wall Street analysts project nearly 100% revenue growth this year).\nWith Nvidia's stock trading at a lower level (and thus lower expectations to meet) than Supermicro's, I think there's no doubt that Nvidia is the superior AI stock. That's not to say that Supermicro is a bad stock, as it will likely continue to succeed due to its strong product offering and customization. However, the valuation bar is a bit higher for Supermicro, so I'm giving the nod to Nvidia.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Could Help This Stock-Split ETF Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million in 10 Years",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) could be one of the most valuable opportunities in history for investors, and the semiconductor industry is at the heart of it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang believes there is a whopping $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure that must be upgraded with new chips to support demand from AI developers.\nNvidia is leading the charge right now, but it won't be the only beneficiary of that opportunity. However, rather than trying to pick which stocks might be the winners and losers over the long term, investors should consider buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) instead.\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) is a specialized fund that invests exclusively in the world's top chip companies, and Nvidia is its largest holding.\nThe SOXX ETF delivered a spectacular compound annual return of 30.4% over the last five years. That's almost triple the yearly return in the S&P 500 index over the same period.\nIn fact, the SOXX ETF recently soared to $680 per share, which made it somewhat inaccessible to smaller investors. As a result, iShares executed a 3-for-1 stock split in March, which increased the number of SOXX shares in circulation threefold, bringing its stock price down by two-thirds organically. It had no impact on the underlying value of the ETF, but it means investors can now buy in for as little as $217 (as of this writing).\nConsidering the substantial AI opportunity ahead for the chip sector, the momentum in the SOXX ETF will likely continue long into the future. Here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million in 10 years -- but don't fret, investors with any amount of starting capital can benefit from a fivefold return if this opportunity pans out.\nNvidia designs some of the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI workloads. They are fitted inside centralized data centers operated by tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon, which in turn sell the computing power to developers so they can build, train, and deploy their AI models.\nNvidia's industry-leading H100 GPU drove the company's data center revenue to a year-over-year increase of 217% in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28) to $47.5 billion. That piece of hardware is the primary reason Nvidia is now a $2.2 trillion company -- and considering the new, more advanced H200 GPU is now shipping, the momentum will likely continue.\nThe SOXX ETF owns stakes in 30 different chip companies, but it's heavily weighted toward its top five holdings, which account for 35.4% of the total value of its portfolio:\nStock\nSOXX ETF Weighting\n1. Nvidia\n8.88%\n2. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO)\n8.28%\n3. Qualcomm\n6.57%\n4. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)\n6.55%\n5. Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU)\n5.08%\nData source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of April 26, 2024, and are subject to change.\nThe ETF's second-largest holding is Broadcom, which is a leader in networking and connectivity hardware for data centers. Its Tomahawk 5 switch, for example, is designed to speed up how quickly data travels from one point to another, which is critical in data centers with thousands of GPUs ingesting mountains of information every second. Broadcom also develops AI software on several fronts through its subsidiaries, including VMWare and Symantec.\nAdvanced Micro Devices is another key holding for the SOXX ETF. The company recently launched its MI300 data center chips to compete with Nvidia, and they have already attracted big customers like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms. Plus AMD is a leader in the emerging AI-enabled personal computing market. Millions of notebooks and devices have already been sold with the company's Ryzen AI chips.\nRounding out the top five is Micron Technology, which is a leading producer of memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips. Its HBM3E memory solution was selected by Nvidia to power the new H200 GPU, primarily because of its incredible efficiency. It consumes 30% less power than competing solutions, which is a key consideration for data center operators because electricity is one of their largest costs.\nOutside of the top five, the SOXX ETF owns popular chip stocks like Intel and Texas Instruments. It also has a stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which is responsible for making more than half of the world's chips, including those designed by Nvidia and AMD.\nThe SOXX ETF has gained 53.5% over the past year, which crushes the 22.3% return of the S&P 500, and even trounces the 33.9% return of the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 index.\nAnd that outperformance isn't an anomaly. The ETF delivered a compound annual return of 30.4% over the last five years, and 25.3% over the last 10 years. Technologies like cloud computing and AI have only gone mainstream over the past decade, which explains the incredible performance.\nBesides Jensen Huang's forecasted $1 trillion opportunity for the data center industry, every computer and device could also be fitted with AI capabilities over the long term, so continued market-beating returns in the SOXX ETF is a real possibility.\nBut even if the SOXX ETF delivered a more moderate annual return of 15% over the next 10 years, it would still lead to significant financial gains for investors.

        "Title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying This Supercharged AI Index Fund Instead",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia has been an ideal long-term investment. Shares soared 45,900% over the last 20 years as the company transitioned from computer graphics trailblazer to accelerated computing powerhouse. But the stock has been especially hot lately. Shares more than tripled during the past 12 months as investors leaned into the artificial intelligence gold rush. But those gains have given rise to concerns about Nvidia's valuation.\nSpecifically, while certain Wall Street analysts still see upside, some expect shares to decline over the next year. The four hedge fund billionaires listed below navigated that situation by selling some Nvidia stock in the fourth quarter, while simultaneously purchasing shares of the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ), an index fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100.\nJohn Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments sold 30,663 shares of Nvidia in the fourth quarter, reducing their stake by 5%. Meanwhile, they increased their position in the Invesco QQQ Trust by 75%, such that the index fund is now the second-largest position in their portfolio.\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management sold 1.7 million shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter, reducing his stake by 45%. Meanwhile, he increased his position in the Invesco QQQ Trust by 53%, though it remains a relatively small holding.\nRon Baron of Bamco sold 59,942 shares of Nvidia in the fourth quarter, reducing his stake by 10%. He also started a small position in the Invesco QQQ Trust.\nWhat makes those trades interesting is that Nvidia is the third-largest position in the Invesco QQQ Trust. In other words, the four fund managers listed above exchanged a portion of their direct ownership in Nvidia for a more diluted form of ownership, which also provides exposure to other technology stocks.\nIn any case, the Invesco QQQ Trust returned 1,260% over the last two decades, more than doubling the performance of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). Here's what investors should know about that supercharged index fund.\nThe Invesco QQQ Trust measures the performance of the Nasdaq-100, an index that tracks the 100 largest companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. The Invesco QQQ Trust spreads capital across 10 of the 11 stock market sectors -- the financial sector is the lone exclusion -- but its composition is most heavily weighted toward the information technology (58.9%) and consumer discretionary (17.9%) sectors.\nThe 10 largest holdings in the Invesco QQQ Trust are listed by weight below.\nMicrosoft: 8.7%\nApple: 7.7%\nNvidia: 6.1%\nAlphabet: 5.3%\nAmazon: 5.3%\nBroadcom: 4.5%\nMeta Platforms: 4.5%\nCostco Wholesale: 2.4%\nTesla: 2.4%\nAdvanced Micro Devices: 1.9%\nWhile many investors consider Nvidia the quintessential artificial intelligence (AI) stock, almost every company listed above is well positioned to monetize AI.\nFor instance, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon are the three largest cloud computing companies in the world, meaning they are gatekeepers of AI infrastructure and platform services. Broadcom is the leader in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), meaning it helps companies like Meta Platforms and Alphabet design custom AI chips.\nSimilarly, Tesla is designing full self-driving software and its supercomputer (Dojo) is purpose-built for training computer vision systems; both represent potentially significant revenue streams. Finally, Advanced Micro Devices is the second largest supplier of data center GPUs, though it trails Nvidia's market share by about 90 percentage points.\nIn short, while the Invesco QQQ Trust is not explicitly an AI index fund, it offers convenient exposure to many companies that should benefit as businesses spend more money on AI.\nThe Invesco QQQ Trust has been an excellent, though volatile, long-term investment. The index fund returned 1,260% over the last 20 years, compounding at 13.9% annually. By comparison, the S&P 500 returned 563% during the same period, compounding at 9.9% annually. In other words, $10,000 invested in the Invesco QQQ Trust in April 2004 would be worth $136,000 today, but the same amount invested in an S&P 500 index fund would now be worth $66,300.\nHowever, that tremendous outperformance has come at price. The Invesco QQQ Trust bears a 10-year beta of 1.12, meaning it moved 112 basis points (1.12 percentage points) for every 100-basis-point movement in the S&P 500. In other words, the Invesco QQQ Trust has been a very volatile investment. That quality cuts both ways. Volatility is helpful when the stock market is moving higher, but hurtful when the stock market is moving lower. As a result, the Invesco QQQ Trust tends to underperform during market downturns.\nThe last item of note is the expense ratio. The Invesco QQQ Trust bears an expense ratio of 0.2%, meaning investors will pay $2 per year on every $1,000 invested in the fund.\nHere is the bottom line: The Invesco QQQ Trust is heavily weighted toward the technology sector. As such, the index fund benefited greatly from disruptive innovations like mobile devices and cloud computing during the last two decades, and it should benefit greatly as AI spending explodes in the coming years. In that sense, the Invesco QQQ Trust is a great option for patient, risk-tolerant investors hoping to capitalize on the AI boom. But it would be a poor choice for any investor hoping to avoid volatility.\nBefore you buy stock in Invesco QQQ Trust, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Invesco QQQ Trust wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Eduardo Baptista, Fanny Potkin and Max A. Cherney ",
        "Text": "By Eduardo Baptista, Fanny Potkin and Max A. Cherney\nBEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese universities and research institutes recently obtained high-end Nvidia artificial intelligence chips through resellers, despite the U.S. widening a ban last year on the sale of such technology to China.\nA Reuters review of hundreds of tender documents shows 10 Chinese entities acquired advanced Nvidia chips embedded in server products made by Super Micro Computer Inc., Dell Technologies Inc. and Taiwan's Gigabyte Technology Co Ltd after the U.S. on Nov. 17 expanded the embargo to subject more chips and countries to licensing rules.\nSpecifically, the servers contained some of Nvidia's most advanced chips, according to the previously unreported tenders fulfilled between Nov. 20 and Feb. 28. While the U.S. bars Nvidia and its partners from selling advanced chips to China, including via third parties, the sale and purchase of the chips are not illegal in China.\nThe 11 sellers of the chips were little-known Chinese retailers. Reuters could not determine whether, in fulfilling the orders, they used stockpiles acquired before the U.S. tightened chip-export restrictions in November.\nContacted by Reuters, Nvidia said the tenders specify products that were exported and widely available before the restrictions. \"They do not indicate that any of our partners violated the export control rules and are a negligible fraction of the products sold worldwide,\" a spokesperson said.\nThe server makers said they complied with applicable laws or would investigate further.\nAmong the buyers were the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Shandong Artificial Intelligence Institute, Hubei Earthquake Administration, the Shandong and Southwest universities, a tech investment firm owned by the Heilongjiang provincial government, a state-run aviation research centre, and a space science centre.\nNone of the Chinese buyers and retail sellers responded to questions from Reuters about the matter.\nDaniel Gerkin, a Washington-based partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis, said Nvidia chips could have been diverted to China without a manufacturer's knowledge, given a lack of visibility into downstream supply chains.\nIf the manufacturer had performed sufficient due diligence, \"it presumably would be challenging for the U.S. government to pursue an enforcement action\", he said.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department told Reuters it could not comment on any potential ongoing investigations, but said its Bureau of Industry and Security monitored diversions of restricted chips, conducted end-use checks and examined potential breaches.\nOfficials would investigate credible allegations of violations, including through the use of shell companies, a spokesperson said.\nNvidia said systems built with its graphic processing units (GPUs) - chips that break computer tasks into smaller pieces and process them together - and resold by third parties must comply with U.S. restrictions.\n\"If we determine that any product was subsequently resold in violation of U.S. export control rules, we'll work with our customers to take appropriate action,\" the spokesperson said.\nSuper Micro said it complied with U.S. requirements on the sale and export of GPU systems to regions and parties that require licenses.\n\"If we become aware that a third party has exported or reexported without the required licenses, we investigate the matter and take appropriate action,\" it said.\nIn a letter to Reuters on behalf of Super Micro, U.S. law firm Clare Locke said its client \"goes above and beyond what U.S. export restrictions require\" by proactively taking steps to ensure its customers do not violate the curbs.\nIn relation to the tenders that identified its products, Super Micro said they represent \"older generation or general purpose servers not capable of the largest scale AI operations that were available in China prior to the export control regulations\". The awarded suppliers \"are not known Supermicro customers\", the company said.\nA Dell spokesperson said the company \"found no evidence of shipping products configured with the restricted chips you listed to the entities you named\", but that it would continue to investigate.\n\"Our distributors and resellers are required to comply with all applicable global regulations and export controls. If we become aware of a distributor or reseller that is not complying with these obligations, we take appropriate actions, including termination of our relationship,\" the spokesperson said.\nGigabyte said in an email that it complied with Taiwanese laws and international regulations. It did not respond to subsequent questions about tenders that identified its products as a source of banned Nvidia chips. Taiwan's economy ministry said it expected Taiwanese companies to respect U.S. export controls.\nRESEARCH BENEFITS\nThe transactions were disclosed in a dozen of the tenders, which Reuters found on public databases that cover only a fraction of purchases by China's state entities. But the small snapshot shows China still has access to advanced chips that U.S. officials say could support AI for military applications, such as the modernisation of China's defence forces or for developing weapons like hypersonic missiles.\nEach of the purchases were limited to several servers and several dozen banned chips. Still, they could be useful for training models and conducting advanced research, according to seven analysts and industry executives.\nThe tenders - valued at between 71,500 yuan and 1.86 million yuan, or about $10,000 and $259,000 - did not specify the intended uses.\nUnder Chinese law, procuring agencies representing state or state-affiliated buyers must check that a supplier can fulfil the tender before it is announced as the winner and a contract is signed.\nReuters only analysed tenders whose winners had been announced.\nCompanies and people accused of violating U.S. export controls can face civil or criminal penalties in the U.S., including fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars and up to 20 years in prison for individuals.\nReuters last year reported that an underground trade in Nvidia chips had emerged in China, as evident at Shenzhen's Huaqiangbei electronics market in June, before the U.S. widened its curbs. On a return visit in December, the vendors who had spoken to Reuters months earlier had gone, and other sellers said they did not know why they left.\nReuters couldn't establish why the vendors were no longer at the market.\n($1 = 7.1932 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Cherney reported from San Francisco.

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's taken Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) roughly seven months to double in value. The stock also doubled in the seven months before then. I think it's highly unlikely that Nvidia will deliver another 100% return over the next seven months.\nHowever, put more time on the clock, and we could have a different ballgame. Here's exactly what it will take for Nvidia stock to double again over the next five years.\nThe most important factor that will determine whether or not Nvidia stock doubles within five years is the law of supply and demand. In a nutshell, this law states that if supply falls and/or demand increases, prices will rise \u2013 and vice versa. In Nvidia's case, the supply and demand for its stock are directly linked to the supply and demand of its graphics processing units (GPUs).\nLet's talk first about the demand side of the equation.\nThe biggest driver of demand for Nvidia's GPUs over the next five years will almost certainly be artificial intelligence (AI). Market researcher Markets and Markets projects the global AI chip market will increase by a compound annual growth rate of 20.8%. Another market researcher, The Brainy Insights, expects a CAGR of nearly 38.2%.\nEven if we use the lower estimate, the demand for Nvidia's GPUs would soar more than 250% over the next five years. All the company has to do is at least keep pace with the overall AI chip market. Considering Nvidia's commanding position in the market now, that shouldn't be a problem.\nBut is the level of growth for the AI chip market predicted by market researchers realistic? I think so. Generative AI and autonomous ride-hailing services are only in their early stages. Both should continue to grow rapidly over the next few years. Also, don't rule out the possibility of major breakthroughs in artificial general intelligence (AGI) that drive increased demand for powerful AI chips.\nNow, let's address the supply side.\nThe economics for Nvidia are simple: As long as there aren't enough viable alternative suppliers of AI chips to meet customers' needs, Nvidia's GPUs will dominate the market. I suspect this could be more of a challenge for Nvidia than demand growth.\nMultiple companies are angling to take away market share from Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel  have launched new AI chips that they argue are more cost-effective than Nvidia's flagship H100 GPU. Several of Nvidia's big customers have developed their own chips to reduce their reliance on Nvidia, including Google parent Alphabet , and Amazon .\nHowever, increased competition doesn't mean Nvidia's share price can't double over the next five years. As long as demand for Nvidia's GPUs grows fast enough, how much market share rivals take is irrelevant.\nThe best way for Nvidia to keep its chips on top is to out-innovate everyone else. Nvidia is clearly trying to do this, as evidenced by the recent introduction of its next-generation Blackwell platform the company says can \"run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.\"\nI've intentionally left out of the discussion what's arguably the biggest obstacle to Nvidia's chances of doubling over the next five years. It's valuation. Nvidia's shares currently trade at 35.6 times sales. This multiple reflects expectations of a lot of growth.\nNYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran, known as the \"Dean of Valuation,\" thinks Nvidia's fair value assuming a revenue CAGR of 32% over the next five years is $436. Nvidia's current share price is more than twice that amount. If Damodaran is right, Nvidia stock is more likely to be halved than it is to double over the next five years. However, Damodaran readily admits that he could be underestimating the demand for Nvidia's chips.\nOne critical ingredient isn't always incorporated in valuation models, though -- investors' expectations of growth beyond the time horizon used by the models. I think Nvidia stock will double over the next five years if the demand for its GPUs exceeds estimates, the company out-innovates its rivals, and investors think those trends will continue well beyond five years into the future.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in the past six months, rising close to 128% during this period. But if you're one of those who missed this AI stock's outstanding rally and are thinking of buying it right now, it would be a better idea to look elsewhere.\nThat's because SoundHound stock has pulled back substantially of late thanks to concerns that its growth may not be strong enough to support its rich valuation. Shares of the company, which provides voice AI solutions, are down nearly 55% in the past month. Despite this sharp pullback, SoundHound AI stock is trading at 22 times sales. That's substantially higher than the U.S. technology sector's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 7.2.\nOf course, SoundHound is projecting robust revenue growth in 2024 and beyond, and also claims to have a solid revenue pipeline. But SoundHound is a small company and there is a good chance of it running into stiff competition from well-heeled rivals. That's why investors looking to buy an AI stock right now might want to consider buying an established name such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Let's look at the reasons why.\nNvidia is the dominant player in the fast-growing market for AI chips. It commands an estimated 90%-plus share of the market, and as a result, business has been growing rapidly in recent quarters.\nAs the chart above shows, Nvidia's growth has been much stronger than that of SoundHound AI. That's despite the fact that Nvidia is a much bigger company and generated almost $61 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (which ended in January this year), an increase of 126% over the prior year. SoundHound AI, on the other hand, finished 2023 with a 47% increase in revenue to $46 million.\nWhat's more, analysts are forecasting Nvidia's revenue to clock faster growth in the current fiscal year as well. The chipmaker's top line is predicted to increase 81% to $110.5 billion in fiscal 2025, which would be higher than the 51% revenue growth that SoundHound is expected to deliver this year. So Nvidia's robust share of the AI chip market, which is slated to clock an annual growth rate of 61% through 2027, puts it in a terrific position to sustain its healthy growth momentum.\nMoreover, Nvidia is a profitable company. It reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 73.8% in fiscal 2024, a nice jump from 59.2% in the previous year. This strong jump in the company's margin, which can be attributed to Nvidia's robust pricing power in AI chips, explains why its adjusted net income shot up to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2024 from $8.4 billion in the preceding year.\nSoundHound AI, on the other hand, reported a net loss of $89 million in 2023. Though that was lower than the $117 million loss it reported in 2022, analysts aren't expecting it to turn profitable any time soon.\nNvidia, meanwhile, is expected to deliver annual earnings growth of almost 38% for the next five years. However, don't be surprised to see Nvidia delivering faster growth. That's because Nvidia is on track to benefit from a much larger addressable opportunity that includes markets such as gaming, automotive, and digital twins.\nMore specifically, the global GPU market is forecasted to grow at an annual rate of 34% through 2032, generating revenue of $773 billion at the end of the forecast period. We have already seen that Nvidia is the leading company in the market for AI GPUs, and it holds a similar position in the personal computer (PC) GPU market as well. This market presents another lucrative growth opportunity for Nvidia.\nSimilarly, the digital twin market presents another multibillion-dollar growth opportunity for the company. SoundHound AI, meanwhile, expects its addressable market to grow to $160 billion by 2026. All this indicates that Nvidia has more room for growth in the long run. That's why choosing the chipmaker over SoundHound looks like a smart move, especially considering the forward valuation multiples of both companies.\nNvidia is trading at 36 times sales, which is higher than SoundHound's trailing sales multiple. But the situation changes when we look at the forward sales multiples.\nBoth stocks have an identical forward P/S ratio. Moreover, Nvidia's solid profitability tells us why it is trading at 36 times forward earnings, which is lower than the U.S. technology sector's earnings multiple of 45.\nWe have already seen that Nvidia is a better growth stock when compared to SoundHound, and it could continue growing at a faster pace in the future as well. So investors who missed SoundHound's rally and are looking for an AI stock to buy right now would do well to choose Nvidia, as it seems in a better position to deliver gains to investors in the long run.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: Members of Congress Are Scooping Up Shares of Its Core Rival Instead",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the 800-pound gorilla of artificial intelligence (AI). Demand for its chips is through the roof. Its shares skyrocketed by 239% last year, and are up around 60% so far in 2024.\nBut Nvidia isn't the only AI company that's popular with investors, and there's another one that has especially found favor with those whom the voters have sent to work on Capitol Hill. Members of Congress are scooping up shares of Nvidia's chief rival instead.\nNvidia ranked in the top 10 among stocks lawmakers sold most in 2023. The trend has continued into this year, with sell transactions outweighing buy transactions by a ratio of more than 2 to 1.\nIt's a completely different story with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), though. Year to date, there have been 11 purchases of AMD shares reported by members of Congress versus only three sell transactions, according to Capitol Trades.\nThe buying has been bipartisan. Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas have each bought AMD shares multiple times in\u00a0 2024.\nMembers of Congress must disclose all trades they make, but they don't have to reveal why they buy and sell specific stocks. It's not too hard to figure out why some lawmakers find AMD appealing, though.\nAMD has lagged well behind Nvidia in the AI chip market thus far. However, it hopes to take some market share from its bigger rival -- and just might be successful in those efforts.\nIn December, AMD unveiled its MI300X AI accelerator and its Instinct MI300A accelerated processing unit. The company claimed the MI300X chip holds its own against Nvidia's H100 graphics processing unit in training large language models. And AMD maintained its new chip beats the H100 GPU in AI inference (the process through which AI models derive conclusions from data).\nIn addition, earlier this month, AMD rolled out its Ryzen line of AI chips for desktops and laptops. It touted the new chips as \"the most advanced x86 processors for AI PCs.\" PC makers including HP and Lenovo are expected to introduce products this quarter featuring AMD's new chips.\nImportantly, AMD doesn't have to beat Nvidia in the AI chip market to be a huge winner. Demand for AI chips should be so great for years to come that a company playing second fiddle in that niche will still make beautiful music for investors.\nMembers of Congress seem to prefer AMD to Nvidia these days. But are they right to feel that way? Is AMD a better AI stock to buy than Nvidia?\nBoth stocks are expensive based on one popular valuation metric: AMD trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 45.7, while Nvidia's forward earnings multiple is about 34.3. However, these metrics are only based on earnings estimates for the next year.\nThere's a good case to be made that AMD could grow faster than Nvidia over the next five years.

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The chip market has exploded over the last year as a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) led to a spike in demand for more powerful hardware. Increased interest in AI services has meant an increased need for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary to train and run AI models.\nAs a result, the companies at the forefront of this technology, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), have enjoyed stock gains of 222% and 84%, respectively, since last April. These companies have exciting outlooks in AI over the long term thanks to their successful chip businesses, and they could profit from the market's tailwinds for years.\nThe AI market hit close to $200 billion last year and is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. That trajectory would see the sector reach nearly $2 trillion by the decade's end.\nSo, despite their meteoric rises this year, the shares of Nvidia and AMD likely still have much to offer new investors over the long term. Let's look closer at these chipmakers and determine whether Nvidia or AMD is the better AI stock this April.\nIt's been hard to avoid coverage of Nvidia over the last year, as it became the poster child for the boom in AI. In 2023, the company cornered the market on AI chips, achieving an estimated 90% market share in GPUs, which sent its earnings skyrocketing.\nIn its fourth quarter of 2024 (which ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The impressive growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike from AI.\nThe company's free cash flow increased by 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, indicating it has the funds to continue investing in AI and retain its market supremacy.\nAs a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has a powerful position. Besides its AI hardware, the company's chips have a wide range of applications, including cloud platforms, video game consoles, laptops, custom-built PCs, and more.\nConsequently, the company is one of the best options for investing in tech, and even more so for those looking to profit from the future of AI.\nAMD was slightly late to the AI party, and Nvidia beat it to the market. But AMD is investing heavily in the industry and has formed some lucrative partnerships that could take it far in the coming years.\nLast December, AMD unveiled its MI300X GPU for AI. The chip was designed to compete directly with Nvidia and has already led to some of tech's most prominent players, like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, to sign on as clients.\nAMD is diversifying by expanding into AI-powered personal computers (PCs). According to research firm IDC, shipments of PCs are projected to receive a major boost this year, with AI integration serving as a key catalyst. And a Canalys report predicts that 60% of all PCs shipped in 2027 will be AI-enabled. \nAMD's earnings have yet to reflect its heavy investment in AI, but the company's recent quarterly report suggests it's moving in the right direction. In its fourth quarter of 2023, revenue rose 10% year over year to $6 billion, beating analysts' expectations by about $60 million. The company's AI-focused data center segment posted 38% revenue growth.\nNvidia and AMD are ready to profit from AI growth for decades. Both stocks would likely strengthen any portfolio over the long term. But earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates indicate AMD might have more room to run over the next two years.\nThese charts show Nvidia's EPS could reach $36 by fiscal 2026, while AMD's might hit just over $7. On the surface, it looks like Nvidia is the clear winner. But multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Nvidia's is 35 and AMD's is 47) yields stock prices of $1,260 for Nvidia and $329 for AMD.\nUsing their recent prices, these projections would see Nvidia's stock rise 44% over the next two fiscal years and AMD's increase by 93%. The significant difference highlights the fact that AMD is at an earlier stage in its AI journey and could have more room for growth in the short term. As a result, AMD is a screaming buy over Nvidia right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have been the two best-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks over the past 12 months. Nvidia's stock surged more than 230% as the explosive growth of the AI market drove more companies to upgrade their data center GPUs to process complex AI tasks. Meanwhile, Meta's stock rallied nearly 140% as the growth of its advertising business accelerated again.\nBut should investors still buy either of these high-growth tech stocks today?\nNvidia once generated most of its revenue by selling discrete GPUs for gaming PCs. But over the past few years, the chipmaker rolled out higher-end GPUs for accelerating machine learning and AI tasks at data centers.\nThat move gave it a firm foothold in the growing AI market, and its sales of data center GPUs soared and eclipsed it sales of gaming GPUs. It generated 78% of its revenue in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January) from data center GPUs.\nIts revenue soared 126% that year as its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 288%. That marked an astonishing acceleration from its flat revenue growth and 25% adjusted EPS decline in fiscal 2023.\nMost of its growth was driven by the rising popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms, which prompted more companies to buy its data center GPUs to upgrade their own AI capabilities. Its sales of gaming GPUs also stabilized in the second half of the year as the PC market recovered.\nIn fiscal 2025, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 81% and 89%, respectively, as the AI market continues to expand. Based on those expectations, Nvidia's stock still looks reasonably valued at 37 times forward earnings. Its smaller rival AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), which is growing at a slower rate, trades at 49 times forward earnings.\nNvidia remains the top seller of shovels and picks for this AI gold rush, but investors shouldn't ignore the longer-term threats. AMD is already rolling out cheaper data center GPUs, major customers like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google are developing their own first-party AI chips, and other major chipmakers like Intel and Qualcomm are teaming up to develop an open source alternative to Nvidia's closed-source CUDA programming platform. All of these challenges could prevent Nvidia from monopolizing the booming market for AI accelerator chips.\nMeta served 3.98 billion monthly active people across its entire family of apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp) at the end of 2023. But back in 2022 its revenue and EPS fell 2% and 38%, respectively. That slowdown was caused by Apple's privacy changes on iOS (which disrupted its ability to mine data from third-party apps), tough competition from ByteDance's TikTok and other social media apps, and the macro headwinds for digital ads.\nAs Meta's advertising business sputtered out, it ramped up its spending on its unprofitable Reality Labs segment, which houses its virtual and augmented reality devices. That mix of slowing revenue growth and rising expenses spooked the bulls.\nBut in 2023 Meta's revenue and adjusted EPS grew 16% and 73%, respectively. It successfully countered Apple's changes by collecting more first-party data with its AI algorithms, kept pace with TikTok by expanding its Reels short video platform, and attracted more ad dollars from Chinese gaming and e-commerce companies that were targeting overseas consumers. Those Chinese advertisers accounted for 10% of Meta's total revenue for the year.\nMeta continued to expand its Reality Labs division, yet it still generated enough cash to initiate its first dividend and raise its current buyback authorization by $50 billion. Those confident moves suggested that brighter days were ahead, and analysts expect its revenue and EPS to rise 17% and 35%, respectively, in 2024. It could even easily exceed those estimates if the U.S. government finally bans its top competitor TikTok this year.\nMeta's stock looks reasonably valued at 25 times forward earnings, but its growth could be throttled by other longer-term challenges. The Chinese advertisers that bought so many ads across its apps in 2023 could abruptly rein in their spending. TikTok might dodge a ban in the U.S. and ramp up the pressure on Instagram and Reels again, and Meta still needs to deal with several unresolved antitrust and privacy investigations in the U.S. and Europe.\nBoth of these Magnificent Seven stocks are solid long-term investments. But if I had to choose one over the other, I'd buy Nvidia instead of Meta for three simple reasons: It's growing a lot faster, it has a wider moat, and it doesn't look overvalued relative to its growth potential yet. Meta will remain the 800-pound gorilla of social media for the foreseeable future, but it will also likely face significantly more macroeconomic, competitive, and regulatory headwinds than Nvidia.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Data center equipment company and Nvidia partner Vertiv Holdings (NYSE: VRT) can do nothing wrong. The stock is up an incredible 561% since the start of 2023 and put on another 20.5% in the week to Friday morning, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nThe latest move comes after Vertiv released a stellar set of first-quarter earnings, which saw the company blast past management's expectations, raise full-year guidance, and report 60% growth in organic orders.\nThe company's growth is driven by data center spending and, in turn, by heavy investment in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. While it's become a favorite theme among investors, Vertiv has the order growth to back up the optimism.\nHere are a few highlights from the quarter:\nOrganic sales up 8% to $1,639 million compared to guidance for a 5% organic increase.\nAdjusted operating profit of $249 million compared to guidance for $210 million.\nFull-year sales guidance raised to 12% organic growth from 10% previously.\nFull-year adjusted operating profit guidance raised to $1.35 billion from $1.3 billion.\nFrankly, it's hard not to think management is being conservative with guidance. After all, the first-quarter adjusted operating profit beat internal expectations by $39 million, and organic orders grew at 60%. In comparison, management only raised its full-year adjusted operating profit by $50 million.\nMoreover, CEO Giordano Albertazzi noted that \"most of the orders overage in Q1 is for deliveries beyond '24.\" As such, it's reasonable to expect investors to start penciling in significantly higher profits for 2025. Indeed, the stock received a slew of analyst upgrades in the days following the results, with analysts citing the early-cycle nature of the AI spending boom.\nInvestors will hope they are correct; if they are, the stock will likely continue its remarkable run.\nBefore you buy stock in Vertiv, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vertiv wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Beth McKenna, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Most of the so-called Big Techs -- the largest publicly traded technology companies --- have split their common stock in recent years. In 2022, e-commerce titan Amazon and Google parent Alphabet each had stock splits. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the leading producer of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, split its stock in 2021, and iPhone maker Apple did so the year before.\nThe stock of one of these companies -- Nvidia -- has run up tremendously recently. It has soared largely due to powerful demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate the training of AI models and running of AI applications in data centers. Nvidia stock entered 2023 at $146.07 per share, and on April 19, 2024, it closed at $762.00. That's a hefty gain of 422% in 16 months.\nMoreover, Nvidia's lofty stock price suggests the company could split its stock again soon.\nNvidia held its initial public offering (IPO) in January 1999. The stock's IPO price was $12 per share. Since then, Nvidia stock has split five times. The IPO price adjusted for stock splits is $0.25.\nDate\nStock-Split Type\nShare Price Prior to Stock-Split Announcement\nJuly 20, 2021\n4-for-1\n$583.36 (May 20, 2021)\nSep 11, 2007\n3-for-2\nN/A\nApr 07, 2006\n2-for-1\nN/A\nSep 12, 2001\n2-for-1\nN/A\nJun 27, 2000\n2-for-1\nN/A\nData sources: Nvidia and Yahoo Finance. N/A= not explored in this article.\nIn 2021, Nvidia stock was priced at $583.36 on the day prior to the company announcing its intention to split its stock. That's nearly $180 less than its current stock price, which provides strong support for the theory the company could split its stock in 2024.\nHere's a summary of the key events involved in Nvidia's last stock split:\nMay 21, 2021 -- The company announced its board of directors declared a 4-for-1 split of its common stock. As is standard practice, the split was contingent upon being approved by stockholders at the company's annual meeting. Nvidia shares gained 6% in the week following this announcement.\nJune 3 -- Shareholders voted to approve the split.\nJuly 19 -- Shareholders of record on June 21 received three additional shares of stock for every one share they held on the record date.\nJuly 20 -- Nvidia stock began trading at its split-adjusted price.\nNvidia hasn't yet announced the date of its 2024 annual meeting, but it should be sometime in June. In 2023, it was on June 22.\nIf Nvidia intends to split its stock this year, investors can expect it to release a statement a couple of weeks in advance of its 2024 annual meeting. This would likely be in the late May to early June time frame.\nA Nvidia stock split won't change the underlying value of the company, nor will it alter an investor's proportionate stake in Nvidia.\nBut stock splits can result in several benefits for investors. The first one has to do with accessibility, as a split should increase the size of the pool of individual investors who might buy the stock. An investor would now need to plunk down $762 to buy a single share of Nvidia. Some folks might only have $250 or $500 to invest. Others might be able to afford to buy one share, but don't want to invest that much money in Nvidia, at least at one time.\nThere are some online brokerages that permit investors to buy (and sell) a fraction of one share. But not all of them do. And my guess is that most investors prefer owning a whole number of shares.\nExisting investors might also benefit from an Nvidia stock split. Soon after a company announces it intends to split its stock, the stock will often rise. This is due to investors' expectation that there will be greater demand for the stock when its accessibility increases. These post-announcement stock bumps, however, are not always sustained.\nLastly, an Nvidia stock split would give the company a much better chance at being included on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the oldest U.S. stock index. This 30-large stock index is price-weighted, which means that extremely high-priced stocks have little chance of being included because they would have too much effect on the index price. A Dow index membership would mean that mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to track the Dow would have to buy shares of Nvidia. This increased demand would exert upward pressure on the stock price.\nIn short, a stock split has the potential to be a slight positive for Nvidia stock. Stock split or not, Nvidia stock remains a great way to invest in the AI boom. That said, investors who are concerned about Nvidia's valuation being too high could buy a portfolio of chip stocks by buying an ETF. The two best-performing semiconductor ETFs over the short and longer terms are VanEck Semiconductor ETF and iShares Semiconductor ETF.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "After concluding 2023 on a high note, NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s NVDA shares are off to a flying start this year. The pioneer in graphic processing units (GPUs) recorded the largest one-day gain in the history of Wall Street on Feb 22, banking on an artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy.\nNVIDIA\u2019s shares have skyrocketed 70.8% this year and have surpassed the Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s gain of 48.5%. So far this year, NVIDIA has outshined other magnificent seven stocks and is now the third-largest company in the United States, lagging only behind Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s stellar surge has made skeptics believe that the stock is in a bubble. After all, stretched valuations and any potential decrease in AI-linked demand for NVIDIA\u2019s chips may lead to a significant decline in the stock price. But NVIDIA isn\u2019t in a bubble! The company\u2019s share prices aren\u2019t gathering momentum based on speculation but due to strong fundamental factors.\nThe unquenchable demand for AI models is here to stay since it is a major driving force behind productivity gains across multiple industries. While Meta Platforms, Inc. META confirmed that the adaptation of AI tools has boosted returns from its ad campaigns, UBS Group AG UBS expects the integration of AI to drive productivity growth over the next three years.\nNow, NVIDIA\u2019s chips are required for AI models deployed across several verticals from manufacturing to cloud computing. This explains why NVIDIA\u2019s H100 graphic cards are the most sought-after commodity in the AI chip market. Such massive demand, thus, has justifiably led to an uptick in NVIDIA\u2019s revenues and earnings.\nNVIDIA\u2019s revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter came in at $22.1 billion, up a solid 265% from a year ago. For the quarter ending on Jan 28, 2024, the company\u2019s earnings per share came in at $4.93, up a whopping 765% from a year ago. What\u2019s more, the company\u2019s data center business, which is involved in the production of the H100 graphic cards, was able to dismiss the negative impact of government restrictions on exporting AI semiconductors to China.\nIn reality, NVIDIA is expected to introduce the B200 Blackwell graphics card to the market. NVIDIA, in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, will produce the powerful AI graphics card, which incidentally has received funding from the U.S. government. This explains why NVIDIA is cheerful about its forthcoming growth and expects revenues of $24 billion for the ongoing quarter, easily beating estimates.\nBut it\u2019s just not about NVIDIA, the euphoria behind the broader AI-boom is not hype, unlike the dot-com era. Tech leaders are primarily involved in commercializing generative AI technology and they have more than double the market capitalization that companies had during the tech bubble in the late 1990s. Their profit margins and return on capital are also way more than the companies in the Internet bubble period. Hence, the strength in their underlying business validates the higher stock prices.\nOn this promising note, NVIDIA remains a market darling and razor-sharp investors should encash on its likely long-term upward movement. NVIDIA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 84% and 14.1%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 73.8% and 17.9%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s current-year earnings has moved up 17.2% over the past 60 days.\nTo top it, NVIDIA\u2019s net profit margin is an outstanding 48.9%, way more than the 20% threshold, signifying a high margin. This means the company is capable of generating the required profit from sales and has successfully kept operational costs under control. NVIDIA is also a cash-rich company making it immune to market upheavals. The company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents were $25.98 billion as of Jan 28, 2024, up from $18.28 billion on Oct 29, 2023.\nNVIDIA, rightfully, has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Growth Score of B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.

        "Text": "Intel (INTC) on Tuesday debuted a new AI chip designed to take on one of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) most popular AI processors as part of its Intel Vision event.\nThe company's Gaudi 3 chip matches and exceeds Nvidia\u2019s H100 AI processor\u00a0when it comes to training and deploying generative AI models. The H100 is one of Nvidia's most popular chips, powering artificial intelligence applications for some of the world's biggest tech companies, from Microsoft to Google.\nAccording to Intel, the Gaudi 3 is 40% more power efficient with 50% faster inferencing than Nvidia\u2019s H100. Training refers to the time it takes to train an AI foundation model like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3, while inferencing is the process of actually using the models for apps.\nIntel says the Gaudi 3 is up to 1.7 times faster when training common large language models than the H100. Intel even says its chip is an average of 1.3 times faster than Nvidia\u2019s beefier Nvidia H200 when it comes to inferencing certain language models.\nIn addition to the Gaudi line of chips and Xeon CPUs, Intel is also marketing so-called AI PCs, computers equipped with neural processing units that can handle onboard AI tasks.\nThese AI maneuvers come at a critical time for Intel.\nThe company is working to reinvent itself as the leader in sophisticated chip technology while building out its chip manufacturing capabilities in the US and abroad. This includes a foundry business that will build Intel\u2019s own chips as well as those for third-party customers. The company has already confirmed it will build chips for Microsoft.\nBut this reinvention is coming at a steep cost, with Intel announcing earlier this month a $7 billion operating loss for 2023 as part of its new financial reporting structure. Intel stock is down 25% so far this year. Rivals Nvidia and AMD (AMD), conversely, are up 15% and 74% so far this year, respectively.\nIntel has been teasing the Gaudi 3 chip for some time, with CEO Pat Gelsinger showing off a version of the platform during a December press event. It\u2019s seen as Intel\u2019s best chance yet to compete with Nvidia in the AI market, a space the graphics chip giant dominates thanks to its powerful hardware and software.\nThe company's new chips also come just a month after Nvidia debuted its own next-generation AI platform called Blackwell. That system includes Nvidia\u2019s B200 AI chip, which is made up of two Blackwell chips mated together to act as a single processor.\nIntel is putting its AI systems forward as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s offerings, claiming an open-source approach that will allow customers to use the services and software that they want.\nAnd while Nvidia is the leader in overall AI technology, Intel is betting enterprises will remain wary of sticking with a single source for high-value needs like AI hardware.\nFor instance, hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others already either offer their own AI chips or are developing them in addition to using Nvidia\u2019s chips.\nIntel\u2019s Gaudi 3 will give those hyperscalers another option in the chip market.\nIntel also announced on Tuesday a new form of Ethernet connectivity for Gaudi 3 nodes, competing with Nvidia\u2019s InfiniBand connectivity technology to ensure uninterrupted connections and processing. The company also debuted its Xeon 6 processors for use in AI systems.\nTaking a page out of Nvidia\u2019s book, Intel is offering the entire setup as a reference design that partners like Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and Super Micro can use to build their own server cabinets.\nIntel says customers will be able to order the Gaudi 3-powered systems in sizes ranging from individual nodes and small boxes to enormous megaclusters that can fill entire data centers.\nCorretion: An earlier version of this story said HP will be one if Intel's partners; it is actually HPE.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA): More Cyclical Than You\u2019d Think",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs semiconductors used in everything from AI to gaming to crypto mining. The company also owns Cuda, an AI training software. I\u2019m bearish on Nvidia, which trades at 76x earnings and what are likely peak profit margins. I believe the company is more cyclical than most people think.\nNvidia, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in electric vehicles, has enjoyed a first-mover advantage in AI. The problem is that, like Tesla in electric vehicles, the competition has increased exponentially, and the company is cyclical and vulnerable to a recession.\nNvidia is no doubt a revolutionary company. The AI language models that it helps power are changing the world. Search has become faster and easier than ever before, and AI will not stop there, with many more use cases on the horizon.\nHowever, much of this revolution is now baked into Nvidia\u2019s financials, with net income having increased from $4.37 billion in year-end 2023 to $29.76 billion in year-end 2024. This is an enormous increase.\nNvidia and the AI revolution look comparable to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the Internet revolution of the late 1990s. I recently checked Intel\u2019s financials from 1993-2000, the period marked by the inception of the Internet. Intel\u2019s net income increased at a much slower pace than Nvidia\u2019s.\nIt took seven years for Intel\u2019s net income to increase 360% vs. one year for Nvidia\u2019s net income to increase 581%. During the recession of 2001, as the Internet bubble deflated, Intel\u2019s net income collapsed 88% from year-end 2000 to year-end 2001.\nI suspect Nvidia\u2019s profits will be no less cyclical than Intel\u2019s. Yet, the market is pricing in an unending upward trend in the company\u2019s earnings. The fact that Nvidia\u2019s net income increased so fast means there\u2019s less growth ahead, not more. If Nvidia\u2019s customers suffer in a recession, which I believe they will, Nvidia will suffer too in terms of falling earnings.\nIn Nvidia\u2019s annual report, the company outlined these risks, saying, \u201cBecause most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s operating margin is at a record high of 54%, but if we look at the company\u2019s history, its average operating margin is closer to just 20%. In a cyclical industry like chip designing, this is a red flag. It means earnings could fall more than 50% just to get back to the norm. In recessions, things can get even worse. Nvidia\u2019s operating margin approached the low single digits in the recession of 2003 and went negative in 2009.\nThere are two reasons Nvidia\u2019s margins could contract. One is the economic weakness we discussed earlier, which could affect Nvidia\u2019s customers. Two is increasing competition, which is now coming from everywhere, including Nvidia\u2019s own customers.\nThis risk was outlined in Nvidia\u2019s annual report, which stated, \u201cOur partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.\u201d\nAll the semiconductor investment we\u2019re seeing, spurred by AI hype and governmental support, is bad news for Nvidia. Big tech companies are spending billions on in-house solutions, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel are racing to catch up, and China is attempting to become semiconductor self-reliant.\nI hate industries that are seeing a lot of investment and increasing competition because that\u2019s usually bad for future profit margins. Nvidia was developing AI solutions in a sleepy market for years, but that has all changed now. AI is the hottest market there is, and new competitors are spending R&D money hand over fist. For this reason, I cannot be sure who will have the technological edge in 10 years\u2019 time. Just as Intel has, Nvidia could easily lose its edge over the years.\nDespite having seen its net income and margins explode upwards, Nvidia is now trading at 76x earnings, 36x sales, and 51x book. Normally, you see the market pricing in that a company is nearing a cyclical peak when earnings surge 581% year-over-year by assigning lower multiples. However, this is certainly not the case for Nvidia.\nCurrently, 39 out of 41 analysts covering NVDA give it a Buy rating, two rate it a Hold, and zero analysts rate it a Sell, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus rating. The\u00a0average Nvidia stock price target\u00a0is $989.53, implying upside potential of 9.2%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $620 per share to a high of $1,400 per share.\nI believe Nvidia is comparable to Intel near the peak of the dot-com bubble. Intel benefited from the Internet boom, with a dominant position in semiconductors used in PCs and technologies used for Wi-Fi. However, as competition increased, overinvestment ran rampant, and demand fell, Intel\u2019s stock and earnings collapsed alongside those of other dot-com names.\nThe same could happen to Nvidia as semiconductor investment has surged in big tech land and China. With a 581% year-over-year increase in earnings, Nvidia\u2019s profits could be nearing a peak. The next recession may mark the end as orders for Nvidia\u2019s products can quickly be canceled due to an industry-specific downturn, wide-scale recession, or substitution for another company\u2019s products.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Author": "  Eleanor Pringle ",
        "Text": "Jensen Huang didn\u2019t build Nvidia into a $2 trillion company without setting high standards for his staff\u2014and while they say it makes him difficult to work for, Huang welcomes the label of \u201cperfectionist.\u201d\nThe Taiwan-born entrepreneur owns approximately 3.5% of the Santa Clara, Calif.\u2013based chipmaker, giving him a net worth of $77.3 billion per Bloomberg.\nHuang\u2019s rise to Silicon Valley stardom has earned him kudos from the likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg who called Huang \u201cthe Taylor Swift of tech.\u201d\nBut Huang has also earned a few other labels from his team, he was told during a recent interview with 60 Minutes. They include: \u201cdemanding,\u201d \u201cperfectionist,\u201d and \u201cnot easy to work for.\u201d\nHuang said those descriptors fit him \u201cperfectly,\u201d explaining: \u201cIt should be like that. If you want to do extraordinary things, it shouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201d\nNvidia has indeed achieved some extraordinary feats in a less-than-stable economic environment. The business\u2019s share price is up 203% over the past year, and 1,818% over the past five.\nDuring its latest earnings call in February, the company revealed revenue of $22 billion for the quarter, up 22% quarter to quarter and a 265% increase compared with last year.\nThese levels of success are a surprise even to Huang himself. The 61-year-old said: \u201cIt\u2019s the most extraordinary thing, that a normal dishwasher busboy could grow up to be this.\u201d\nThe now father of two began working at a Denny\u2019s at age 15\u2014and the restaurant later served as the setting where he and two friends came up with the business idea that would go on to make him a billionaire.\nAccording to a 2023 Nvidia blog post, Huang, along with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem (who both worked at Sun Microsystems), met at what was one of Denny\u2019s \u201cmost popular\u201d locations in Northern California to discuss \u201ccreating a chip that would enable realistic 3D graphics on personal computers.\u201d Thus, the idea for Nvidia was born.\nBut in the interview this week, Huang made it clear it had taken much more than a good idea to build Nvidia into the brand it is today: \u201cThere\u2019s no magic; it\u2019s just 61 years of hard work every single day.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more than that.\u201d\nFans of Huang, whose behemoth business now forms part of the Magnificent Seven stock group, won\u2019t be surprised by his grind mentality.\nEarlier this year Huang told students at his alma mater, Stanford, that they should lower their expectations. \u201cPeople with very high expectations have very low resilience\u2014and unfortunately, resilience matters in success,\u201d Huang explained. \u201cOne of my great advantages is that I have very low expectations.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cFor all of you Stanford students, I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering. Greatness comes from character, and character isn\u2019t formed out of smart people\u2014it\u2019s formed out of people who suffered.\u201d\nWhile some experts are fearing the unknown ramifications of AI, the president of Nvidia is hoping to be surprised.\nIn February the company published footage of its Eos supercomputer, a sister product to its AI platform of the same name. The model, powered by H100 systems, is a data-center\u2013scale supercomputer \u201cdesigned to power the next frontier in AI innovation.\u201d\nAn Eos supercomputer can do \u201cquadrillions of calculations a second,\u201d Huang said.\nBut despite how advanced the high-profile technology is, Huang isn\u2019t worried about it performing in unexpected ways. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that it does things that surprise us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point.\u201d\nHuang, who has joined an advisory board for the government on the safety of AI, continued: \u201cIn some areas like drug discovery, designing materials that are better, lighter, we need artificial intelligence to help us explore the universe in places that we could have never done ourselves.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

And in its bull-case scenario, Evercore said Nvidia stock could surge to $1,540 in the next year, a jump of 81% from current levels.\nDriving that lofty price target is the idea that Nvidia is much more than a chip company, but the bulk of investors still only see it as that.\n\"We think investors underestimate 1) the importance of the chip+hardware+software ecosystem that Nvidia has created, 2) that computing eras last 15-20 years and are typically dominated by a single vertically integrated ecosystem company, whose returns are measured in 100-to-1000 bagger range,\" Evercore's Mark Lipacis said.\nThe key thesis behind Lipacis' bullish call is that Nvidia is an AI ecosystem play, and it's the clear leader in a new computing platform that will drive efficiency gains for years to come.\n\"That 'Ecosystem Play' typically captures 80% of the value created during its respective computing era, while other[s] compete for the other 20%,\" Lipacis said.\nLipacis expects Nvidia to capture 80% of the parallel processing market by 2030, which could be worth more than $350 billion. In such a scenario, Nvidia would have an earnings power of $69 per share by the end of the decade, compared to the company generating earnings per share of $11.93 last year.\n\"We believe that the Tectonic Shift to the current Parallel Processing / IoT Computing Era started 5-to-8 years ago, and that NVDA is the dominant ecosystem play in parallel processing, which is only in the beginning phases of generating outsized returns for its investors,\" Lipacis said.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Title": "Is Nvidia Also the Best Bet in Quantum Computing Right Now?",
        "Author": "  Nicholas Rossolillo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In a discussion with analysts and media members following his keynote address at GTC 2024 (a leading conference on artificial intelligence), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang outlined a list of top technologies his company is at the forefront of developing: industrial robotics, 6G (move over, 5G), weather prediction, particle physics analysis, biology, and so on.\nAmong those massive developments Huang mentioned was quantum computing.\nIn fact, as researchers and developers race to make a breakthrough, Nvidia stock might be the best bet on quantum computers right now. Here's what you need to know.\nMany investors are looking to invest in a company developing a quantum computer. That makes sense. Before software and services can be developed, hardware itself is where it all begins.\nThere is incredible promise in quantum computing, which uses \"superposition\" in quantum mechanics to store and compute exponentially more information than classical computers, including Nvidia's accelerated compute systems powered by its leading GPU chips.\nA company that could solve the many challenges with developing an intricate system that taps the power of quantum mechanics could make a great deal of money. Only a few publicly traded start-ups are available, including IonQ, but all of these companies are still in research and development (R&D) mode. Nvidia is in on this game, but it has taken a hybrid approach.\nIn March 2023, Nvidia announced -- in conjunction with privately held start-up Quantum Machines -- a GPU-accelerated quantum computing control unit that orchestrates the operations of a quantum computer. I wrote about it here about a year ago.\nAt the GTC event, Huang said:\nWe should be a great partner for the quantum computing industry. How else are you going to drive a quantum computer? To have the world's fastest computer sitting next to it?\u00a0And how are you going to simulate a quantum computer, emulate a quantum computer? What is the programming model for a quantum computer? You can't just program a quantum computer all by itself. You need to have classical computing sitting next to it. And so the quantum would be kind of a quantum accelerator. ... Who should go do that? Well, we've done that.\nWhat Huang is saying is that Nvidia is already at the heart of the quantum industry.\nThese complex new quantum computing systems aren't just going to be invented out of thin air. Nvidia's acceleration platform is even now powering the R&D work on the hardware itself, helping simulate the design of new types of \"chips\" for quantum computing.\nThe work doesn't stop there. Nvidia is also helping to accelerate the coding of the new software that will run on a quantum computer, since superposition that encodes that exponential leap in information can't simply operate on the classical ones and zeroes that our computers today use. And even once quantum computers begin to go into more widespread use, they will need a classical computer interface so that the massive amount of data being cranked out is usable to users of classical computers.\nAll of this is where Nvidia comes in. Much like it has done with its AI systems, it has an ecosystem of hardware (like the aforementioned one with Quantum Machines) and a library of software algorithms sitting atop the hardware, powering the quantum computing industry R&D efforts.\nTo be clear, Nvidia itself is not involved in developing a quantum computer -- at least, not that it has publicly disclosed. Instead, it is using its computing acceleration prowess using AI and a library of development software to help researchers and start-ups around the globe bring useful quantum computers to market. In conversations with Nvidia and others in the industry, widespread commercialization (not R&D spending) is likely still at least a few years away, if not more.\nUntil then, add quantum computing R&D spending -- which no doubt gets filed under Nvidia's large and fast-growing \"data center\" revenue segment -- to the list of reasons Nvidia stock is worth holding for the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adam Hejl ",
        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 10% in the afternoon session after major indices declined with the Nasdaq down 2.1% while the S&P 500 fell by 0.9%. Netflix reported mixed results to kick off the new earnings season. The video-streaming giant provided underwhelming sales guidance for the full year and guided for growth to decelerate in the second half of the year.\u00a0Also, Netflix surprisingly announced it will stop disclosing subscriber count (starting in the first quarter of 2025), and this is contributing to the market's concerns about the business. The company's post-earnings stock decline is likely dampening the sentiment toward tech stocks.\nIt was a challenging week for most risk assets following news of escalating tension between Israel and Iran, which is raising concerns among investors, given the potential disruptions to business supply chains, especially in the Middle East. These add to the ongoing inflation worries after the March 2024 CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) report revealed inflation came in slightly hotter than expected. On April 16, 2024, Fed Chair Jerome Powell echoed similar sentiment, adding, \"The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.\" This suggests the Fed might not lower its policy rates as fast as anticipated in 2024, with markets pricing in fewer rate cuts for the year.\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 9 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 11 months ago, when the stock gained 23.7% on the news that the company delivered an exceptional quarter that topped analysts' estimates across key metrics. Revenue surpassed expectations by an impressive 10.3%, driven by strong data center revenue. Notably, the company improved profitability, with both gross margin and operating margin outperforming expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) beat by an impressive 18.8%. Inventory levels experienced a nice decrease during the quarter. In addition to the outstanding quarterly results, the revenue guidance for the next quarter surpassed expectations by over 50%. Yes, that's not a typo. Similarly, the operating profit guidance exceeded Consensus estimates meaningfully.\nFounder and CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the ongoing transformations in the computer industry, particularly the advancements in accelerated computing and generative AI. He highlighted Nvidia's readiness to seize the opportunities presented by the anticipated trillion-dollar shift in global data center infrastructure from general-purpose to accelerated computing, as firms implement generative AI into their business operations.\nOverall, the company's blowout quarter, with its impressive revenue growth, enhanced profitability, and positive guidance, underscored its strength in the market. Nothing in this world is perfect, but this was a near-perfect quarter.\nNvidia is up 58.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $764.31 per share it is still trading 19.5% below its 52-week high of $950.02 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $16,239.\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "Title": "Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Trading Lower Today",
        "Author": "  Adam Hejl ",
        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 10% in the afternoon session after major indices declined with the Nasdaq down 2.1% while the S&P 500 fell by 0.9%. Netflix reported mixed results to kick off the new earnings season. The video-streaming giant provided underwhelming sales guidance for the full year and guided for growth to decelerate in the second half of the year.\u00a0Also, Netflix surprisingly announced it will stop disclosing subscriber count (starting in the first quarter of 2025), and this is contributing to the market's concerns about the business. The company's post-earnings stock decline is likely dampening the sentiment toward tech stocks.\nIt was a challenging week for most risk assets following news of escalating tension between Israel and Iran, which is raising concerns among investors, given the potential disruptions to business supply chains, especially in the Middle East. These add to the ongoing inflation worries after the March 2024 CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) report revealed inflation came in slightly hotter than expected. On April 16, 2024, Fed Chair Jerome Powell echoed similar sentiment, adding, \"The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.\" This suggests the Fed might not lower its policy rates as fast as anticipated in 2024, with markets pricing in fewer rate cuts for the year.\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 9 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 11 months ago, when the stock gained 23.7% on the news that the company delivered an exceptional quarter that topped analysts' estimates across key metrics. Revenue surpassed expectations by an impressive 10.3%, driven by strong data center revenue. Notably, the company improved profitability, with both gross margin and operating margin outperforming expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) beat by an impressive 18.8%. Inventory levels experienced a nice decrease during the quarter. In addition to the outstanding quarterly results, the revenue guidance for the next quarter surpassed expectations by over 50%. Yes, that's not a typo. Similarly, the operating profit guidance exceeded Consensus estimates meaningfully.\nFounder and CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the ongoing transformations in the computer industry, particularly the advancements in accelerated computing and generative AI. He highlighted Nvidia's readiness to seize the opportunities presented by the anticipated trillion-dollar shift in global data center infrastructure from general-purpose to accelerated computing, as firms implement generative AI into their business operations.\nOverall, the company's blowout quarter, with its impressive revenue growth, enhanced profitability, and positive guidance, underscored its strength in the market. Nothing in this world is perfect, but this was a near-perfect quarter.\nNvidia is up 58.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $764.31 per share it is still trading 19.5% below its 52-week high of $950.02 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $16,239.\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "Title": "At US$877, Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Worth Looking At Closely?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Let's talk about the popular NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of 47% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today we will analyse the most recent data on NVIDIA\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nNVIDIA is currently expensive based on our price multiple model, where we look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 72.56x is currently well-above the industry average of 28.15x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that NVIDIA\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. NVIDIA's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? NVDA\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NVDA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nIf you want to dive deeper into NVIDIA, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for NVIDIA and we think they deserve your attention.\nIf you are no longer interested in NVIDIA, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Sasha Rogelberg ",
        "Text": "The 7.4-magnitude earthquake that hit Taiwan Wednesday morning could rock AI darling Nvidia after its main chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) temporarily halted production and evacuated its factories.\nTSMC said it moved staff from some production centers after its science parks in Hsinchu, Longtan, Zhunan, and Taichung experienced earthquake shocks with a magnitude up to 5.0. Initial inspections of TSMC\u2019s construction sites were normal, but it said a \u201csmall number\u201d of tools were damaged in certain production areas that partially impacted operations. Fabrication plant tool recovery was at over 70% within 10 hours of the quake, and none of TSMC's critical tools were impacted, the company reported. The chip manufacturer\u2019s local rival United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) also took measures to evacuate certain facilities and halt some operations.\n\u201cTSMC\u2019s safety systems are operating normally,\u201d the company said in a statement to Fortune. \u201cPreventative measures to ensure employee safety and well-being were initiated at that time according to procedure, and some fabs were evacuated. All personnel are safe and returned to their workplace shortly after the incident.\u201d\nUMC did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment. An Nvidia spokesperson told Fortune the company is monitoring the situation and ensuring employee safety, but has not released an official statement.\nNvidia is TSMC\u2019s second-largest client, behind only Apple, and relies on the manufacturer to produce the semiconductor chips it designs for chip systems that power AI software and advanced graphics processing units. Last year, Nvidia paid the chipmaker $7.73 billion for its services, accounting for 11% of TSMC\u2019s revenue, according to financial analyst Dan Nystedt. With a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion, Nvidia is the third-largest company in the U.S., effectively driving the AI revolution.\nTSMC and UMC shares faltered about 1.3% and 1%, respectively, early Wednesday, while Nvidia shares have remained steady.\nWednesday\u2019s earthquake in Taiwan was the country\u2019s largest in 25 years, resulting in over 100 buildings being damaged. There are nine people confirmed dead and over 960 injured. While the earthquake hit the island\u2019s east coast\u2014with many of TSMC\u2019s factories located on the west coast\u2014there were over 29 aftershocks across the island with a magnitude over 4.0, capable of moderate damage.\nSemiconductor chips are notorious for their finicky electrical properties and are more sensitive to light, dust, and particle contaminants. They require clean rooms with filtered air\u2014an environment comparable to a surgical table.\nWhile TSMC reported normal operations and has not disclosed the results of an ongoing inspection of facilities, analysts warn it will take time for the company to bounce back.\n\"Mitigating the impacts of the earthquake necessitates careful measures and time to restore production and uphold quality standards, presenting additional implications and obstacles,\" consultancy Isaiah Research said in a note, Reuters reported.\nTaiwan experiences about 2,200 earthquakes a year, according to the Central Weather Administration Seismological Center, and TSMC has taken precautions over the years to mitigate natural disaster-induced damages. After a 6.6-magnitude earthquake hit its Tainan fabrication plants in February 2016, TSMC added additional ceiling bracings and stoppers on storage shelves to prevent sliding.\nNvidia\u2019s centralized operations in Taiwan is the company\u2019s primary weakness, experts argue. Its nearly sole reliance on TSMC makes it vulnerable to any supply-chain or production hitches the manufacturer encounters. While there are a handful of other chip manufacturers, TSMC has the edge over competitors with its ability to stack and package chips for heavy data processing.\nTaiwan is under increased military threat from China, which claims Taiwan as a part of its republic despite Taiwan\u2019s independence movement, and this turmoil presents another threat to the security of TSMC\u2019s operations.\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang reiterated Taiwan\u2019s centralized role in chipmaking amid concerns of political conflict at a technology event in Taipei last June. Nvidia is currently building plants in the U.S., and TSMC is preparing to begin operations at a plant in Arizona, though its opening has been delayed.\n\"When I was here, in all of our supply-chain discussions, we feel perfectly safe,\u201d he said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "A boom in artificial intelligence (AI) shook up the tech world last year. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reignited interest in the technology and highlighted just how far AI had come. As a result, countless companies have pivoted their businesses to the budding sector in an effort to take their slice of a $200 billion pie.\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030, which would see it achieve a valuation nearing $2 trillion by the end of the decade.\nConsequently, it's not too late to invest in AI, and chip stocks are some of the most attractive options. These companies are developing the hardware necessary to train and run AI models, suggesting they'll be well positioned to profit from the AI market's tailwinds for years.\nAs leading chipmakers, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have significant potential in AI. However, these companies are at drastically different stages in their AI journeys, which could mean one has more room to run over the long term.\nSo, let's examine these chipmakers more closely and determine whether Nvidia or Intel is the better AI stock right now.\nNvidia's business has exploded over the last year. Its stock is up 230% since last April. Meanwhile, its quarterly revenue and operating income have spiked 207% and 536%, respectively, thanks to soaring chip sales.\nIn 2023, Nvidia cornered the market on AI graphics processing units (GPUs) while many of its competitors scrambled to catch up. Nvidia's head start allowed it to take full advantage of the increased demand for AI GPUs, capturing an estimated 90% market share.\nNvidia's meteoric rise has some analysts questioning how much room the company has left to run. However, its stock keeps defying expectations, rising 60% in the last three months. Meanwhile, Nvidia's free cash flow has increased by 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, indicating it has the funds to continue investing in AI and retain its market supremacy. \nGiven the massive potential of AI and Nvidia's position in the market, I wouldn't bet against it over the long term.\nNvidia's established role in AI has made it one of the more reliable options. However, it could be worth looking at a company like Intel, which isn't as settled in the industry but could have more growth potential.\nIntel has hit more than a few roadblocks in recent years. Its stock is down about 45% over the past three years after seeing decreased market share in central processing units (CPUs) and ending a more than decade-long partnership with Apple.\nHowever, Intel is making major changes to its business, which could see it come back strong in the coming years. Last June, Intel announced a \"fundamental shift\" to its business, adopting an internal foundry model that it believes will help it save $10 billion by 2025.\nMoreover, Intel is moving into AI. In December 2023, the company debuted a range of AI chips, including Gaudi3, a GPU designed to challenge similar offerings from Nvidia. Intel also showed off new Core Ultra processors and Xeon server chips, which include neural processing units for running AI programs more efficiently.\nIntel is on the road to recovery, but it will take time for its financials to reflect recent changes. As a result, an investment in Intel is recommended for more patient investors who are willing to hold for at least a decade. \nThis chart indicates Intel's stock is trading at a significantly better value than Nvidia's, with a far lower forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio.\nForward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated earnings per share. Meanwhile, P/S divides its market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. These are useful valuation metrics since they consider a company's financial health. And for both, the lower the figure, the better the value.\nAs a result, Intel's lower forward P/E and P/S suggest its stock is trading at a bargain compared to Nvidia's. However, the question is which is the better AI stock, not which is the better value.\nConsequently, the answer lies in the investor. If you're looking to invest in an established AI company that will likely deliver consistent but potentially small gains over many years, Nvidia is the answer. However, if you're willing to take a chance on Intel's ability to turn things around and potentially reap major rewards for its efforts, it's the AI stock to buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Josh Schafer    and Karen Friar    ",
        "Text": "US stocks fell on Wednesday, struggling to mount a comeback as investors' interest rate worries coincided with a fresh slate of corporate earnings.\nAfter all three major indexes started the day in the green, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended down about 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost a more modest 0.1%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses, falling over 1%.\nBig Tech drove the market action, with Nvidia (NVDA) falling almost 4% and Meta (META) sliding over 1%. The tech sector (XLK) was the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500, falling nearly 1.5%.\nStocks have struggled to reprise their early-year rally, buffeted most recently by worries over heightened tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty over the timing and depth of rate cuts.\nAnother bump came on Tuesday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's downbeat comments on inflation prompted some to recalibrate their bets on a September cut to December.\nAfter robust big bank results signaled a return to strength on Wall Street, investors are looking to earnings season to give stocks a push upward. United Airlines (UAL) shares rose more than 17% after posting a revenue beat late Tuesday.\nBut shares of ASML (ASML) fell more than 7% in New York after the Dutch company's quarterly update. ASML, the largest supplier of equipment to chipmakers worldwide, missed order estimates, though its sales to China held up amid US curbs.\nThe S&P 500 closed lower for a fourth straight day on Wednesday. This marks the benchmark average's first four-day losing streak since a stretch from late December into the start of 2024, per Bespoke Invest.\nThe market action has whipsawed more than usual too, reflecting the \"bumpier path\" forward some Wall Street strategists see the market headed.\nIn each of the last four sessions, the S&P 500 has closed at least 0.5% lower than its session high. The only other time that's happened since the start of 2023 was back in October, the most recent bottom for the S&P 500, Bespoke also noted.\nArm holdings (ARM) led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page on Wednesday as shares fell nearly 10% amid a broader sell-off in chip stocks. The move came after ASML (ASML), the largest supplier of equipment to chipmakers worldwide, missed order estimates in a quarterly release on Wednesday. Nvidia (NVDA) shares also fell more than 2% on the news.\nMeanwhile, United Airlines (UAL) stock rose more than 16% after the company reported a narrower-than-expected loss than Wall Street expected. For the first quarter, United posted an earnings per share loss of $0.15, narrower than the $0.57 Wall Street expected, per Bloomberg data.\nMeanwhile, United guided for earnings per share in the current second quarter in a range of $3.75 to $4.25. This came in above Wall Street's projections for $3.73.\nOil futures fell roughly 3% on Wednesday, extending their declines over the past two days as the risk of a widening conflict in the Middle East appeared to ease.\nAnalysts anticipate Israel is unlikely to hit Iran's oil production when it responds to Tehran's attack on Israeli government targets unleashed over the weekend.\n\"Crude futures continue to unwind some of the Geopolitical premium that has been priced in,\" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, said in a recent note on Wednesday.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures settled at $82.69 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, fell below $88 per barrel.\nCrude has come off its 2024 intraday highs touched earlier this month when WTI rose above $87 per barrel and Brent surpassed $92 per barrel.\nRising bond yields have been a key catalyst for stock drawdowns over the past year. \nBut as the market shifts to expect that interest rates may remain higher than the previous decade for longer than many initially hoped, BMO chief investment strategist Brian Belski notes that higher rates haven't always been a bad enviornment for stocks.\nIn an analysis going back to 1990, Belski found that the S&P 500's monthly return has actually delivered its best annualized average returns when the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) was higher.\nBelski's work shows the benchmark average delivered an average annual return of 7.7% in months where the 10-year Treasury yield was less than 4%, compared to an average annual return of 14.5% in months when the 10-year was 6%.\n\"In a higher interest rate environment, certainly higher than 0%-1% or 0%-2%, stocks traditionally do very well,\" Belski said. \"So I think we're recalibrating that. We still think from these levels stocks are higher at year-end.\"\nBelski's research shows that, on average, stocks have performed better in a rising rate environment than in a falling rate environment. The average annual rolling one-year return for the S&P 500 during a falling rate environment is 6.5%, while it's 13.9% in a rising rate regime.\nHe argued that this makes sense given that one reason the Fed would keep rates lower or cut them would be a sluggish economic growth outlook. Given the current backdrop is one in which the Fed feels the economy is in a strong position to handle higher borrowing costs, increased rates might not be so bad for stocks, Belski said.\n\"If we can hover between this 4% and 5% range [on the 10-year Treasury yield] and still have strong employment, but most importantly, have very strong earnings and, oh by the way, cash flow, I think the market can do very well,\" he added.\nShares of ASML (ASML) fell more than 8% in New York after the Dutch company's quarterly update revealed that the largest supplier of equipment to chipmakers worldwide missed order estimates for the most recent quarter.\nNet bookings for ASML's machinery declined 4% compared to the same year prior and were down nearly two-thirds from the quarter prior.\n\u201cOur outlook for the full year 2024 is unchanged, with the second half of the year expected to be stronger than the first half, in line with the industry\u2019s continued recovery from the downturn,\u201d ASML CEO Peter Wennink said in a statement.\nThe disappointing outlook, by Wall Street's standards, forced selling action across the chip sector. Market leader Nvidia (NVDA) dipped more than 2%, while AMD (AMD) fell more than 4%.\nIn a counterintuitive development, mortgage demand picked up for the second consecutive week even though rates rose during that period.\nThe volume of mortgage applications increased 3.3% from the prior week ending April 12, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) reported. Purchase applications drove the increase.\nJoel Kan, MBA's deputy chief economist, said in a release that \"application activity picked up, possibly as some borrowers decided to act in case rates continue to rise.\"\nMortgage rates have been hovering above 7%. The prospect of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve looks cloudy following recent higher-than-anticipated inflation prints.\n\u201cRates increased for the second consecutive week, driven by incoming data indicating that the economy remains strong and inflation is proving tougher to bring down. Mortgage rates increased across the board, with the 30-year fixed rate at 7.13% \u2014 reaching its highest level since December 2023,\u201d Kan said.\nThe average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances of $766,550 or less increased to 7.13% from 7.01%, the MBA data showed. Meanwhile, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages backed by the FHA increased to 6.90 % from 6.80%.\nStocks turned lower on Wednesday led by losses across tech.\nAs Yahoo Finance's Myles Udland recently noted, the so-called \"Magnificent\" group of tech stocks that led the 2023 market rally still represent a historically high portion of the S&P 500's market cap. And midway through the trading day on Wednesday, that helped lead stocks lower.\nNvidia (NVDA) fell more than 2%, while Meta (META) slid nearly 2%. The tech sector (XLK) was the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500, falling more than 1%.\nBelow is a look at moves in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) as of 12:30 p.m. ET.\nA growing number of investors\u00a0believe the US economy is headed for a \"no landing\" scenario, in which inflation doesn't reach the Fed's 2% target, but the US economy keeps growing.\nThirty-six percent of respondents to Bank of America's Global Fund Manager Survey, released on Tuesday, said they believe the most likely outcome for the global economy is a \"no landing.\" This was a noted move higher from the 23% who saw the outcome a month ago and the highest level seen since June 2023, the earliest date on BofA's graph.\nMeanwhile, 54% of respondents believe a soft landing \u2014 where economic growth slows but not to the point of recession, and inflation returns to its historical average \u2014 is the most likely outcome.\nThis shows a shift in the discussion on Wall Street, as just 7% of respondents believe a hard landing, where restrictive policy forces the economy into recession, is the base case. Last year, much of the debate on Wall Street was whether a hard or soft landing was in the cards for the economy.\nNow, the debate has shifted to whether recent better-than-expected economic data could prohibit further progress on inflation.\n\"Recessions don't hit the US economy without a catalyst of some sort, and we just don't see what is going to stop consumer spending,\" Jefferies US economist Tom Simons wrote in a note on April 12. \"With demand still solid, it is hard to see how inflation will continue to slow down, and thus it is hard to see how the Fed can cut rates.\"\nRead more here.\nIt's early in earnings season, but a warning sign is flashing for investors as quarterly results roll in.\nIn a market that's priced in significant earnings growth for the rest of this year, investors are watching closely how companies live up to their expectations.\nWith 43 S&P 500 companies having reported first quarter earnings, those that miss estimates for both earnings per share and revenue have seen a negative stock reaction of more than 10% the next day. This is well above the 3.1% average fall seen over the last five years, per Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel.\nAnd as seen in the chart below from Emanuel, any mix of company beats or misses on earnings and revenue for the quarter have driven worse returns for investors on average this quarter.\nGiven the market's recent slump on fears inflation's downward path may have stalled and the Fed could cut rates less than expected, how this earnings season plays out will be increasingly \"critical\" for the market rally, according to BlackRock global chief investment strategist Wei Li.\n\"Earnings have come to the rescue because markets are up year to date, despite the hawkish repricing,\" Li told Yahoo Finance. \"So we'll see if earnings will continue to come to the rescue of hawkish repricing, even as the bar has increased as well for earnings.\"\nUnited Airlines (UAL) stock rose more than 10% on Wednesday morning after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results. \nThe airliner reported a $200 million impact on earnings from the recent Boeing 737 Max 9 grounding, a loss lower than Wall Street analysts expected.\n\"In a way, you could say the damage here is pretty limited,\" Nicolas Owens, Morningstar Industrials equity analyst, told Yahoo Finance.\nFor the first quarter, United posted an earnings per share loss of $0.15, narrower than the $0.57 Wall Street expected, per Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, United's revenue of $12.54 billion came in above estimates for $12.44 billion.\nUnited guided for earnings per share in the current second quarter in a range of $3.75 to $4.25, which was above Wall Street's projections of $3.73.\nUS stocks rose on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) eyeing a comeback as investors put interest rate worries on the back burner to focus on quarterly earnings.\nThe S&P 500 was up roughly 0.4% after booking a three-day run of losses, while Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, rising more than 0.5%.\nUnited Airlines (UAL) was the standout on Wednesday morning, with shares rising more than 7% in morning trade after posting a revenue beat after the bell.\nNetflix (NFLX) shares have had a great ride this year, up 27% year to date (a move not many people have talked about).\nThe bulls haven't been shaken in a volatile April for markets, with the stock up 1.6% versus the 3.9% drop for the S&P 500.\nThe vibe on the Street is that when Netflix reports earnings after the close on Thursday, it will show continued benefits of its crackdown on password sharing and a strong original content slate. In short, investors are positioned for another blowout quarter from the streaming beast.\nBut, there is some concern creeping in on the Street on the back half of the year outlook for Netflix. The company will be cycling several impressive quarters from 2023 (meaning growth could slow), and investors know the bullish thesis very well.\nWhat they may be missing are a few points brought to light by Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft this morning.\nHere's what Kraft said in a client note:\nMore on what to watch from Netflix earnings from yours truly down below.\nA good amount of focus this morning in markets is on what Fed chief Jerome Powell said on Tuesday, that it will \"take longer than expected\" to get inflation down to the Fed's 2% target.\nLost in the Powell focus, though, were even more hawkish comments from Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson.\n\u201cIf incoming data suggest that inflation is more persistent than I currently expect it to be, it will be appropriate to hold in place the current restrictive stance of policy for longer. I am fully committed to getting inflation back to 2%,\" Jefferson said.\nIn the wake of this commentary, fed funds futures are now pricing in only 40 basis points of rate cuts by year-end. Deutsche Bank points out this is the lowest this has been so far in this cycle.\nBut I have to wonder if investors are truly getting that the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates at all this year! Check out the CME Fed Watch tool below for the Fed's December meeting. More people are looking for rate cuts than those expecting rates to be at the same level they are today.\nAll in all, earnings season has started well. But interestingly, investors may have priced it in months ago.\nTo date, 43 S&P 500 companies have reported first quarter results. Reported sales growth has been a solid 4.5%, and earnings have expanded quicker by 8.8% (despite sticky inflation weighing on profit margins).\nHowever, despite the solid growth rates, the average stock price dropped 1.2% after the results, according to data crunched by Evercore ISI strategist Julian Emanuel.\nCompanies beating on both the top and bottom lines have seen their stock rise only 0.6% after the results. Companies that have missed on both the top and bottom lines (known as double misses) have seen their stock price hammered by 10.4% on average.\nI can't get enough of this Tesla (TSLA) fall-from-grace story!\nSo I am back (see 6:00 a.m. post below) with a new piece of research that just came my way on Tesla from Deutsche Bank auto analyst Emmanuel Rosner. I loved this title on his Tesla section: \"Clarity Needed on Future Direction of the Company.\"\nPerfectly said, and most others on the Street would agree.\nHere's what Rosner said, which goes a long way in explaining why Tesla's stock has gotten run over:\n\"Perhaps most importantly, we view recent sequence of Tesla news as potentially thesis-changing for investors. With still many questions unanswered, it may be too early to tell if it is particularly bearish, or just neutral. As of now, it is unclear if a drivable version of Model 2 is still coming and if so when; how far along is robotaxi in its development and what a realistic timeline for deployment is in light of considerable technology and regulatory hurdles ahead. We expect Tesla to have to comment on these on its upcoming earnings call. Unfortunately, if Tesla were to confirm that its renewed robotaxi focus comes at the expense of Model 2, we believe this would introduce considerably higher risk profile for the stock, and remove a key reason many shareholders currently own the stock. More critically, this change in strategy would also make any upside from here tied to Tesla cracking the code on full driverless autonomy, which represents a significant technological and regulatory challenge.\n\"All in, we await clarity from Tesla on any change in strategy. If Robotaxi is being accelerated with no focus or timeline change for Model 2, this may be perceived as a positive signal of Tesla\u2019s confidence in its autonomous technology and could potentially be accretive to out year estimates. If, however, Model 2 is being pushed out or canceled, we would view it as completely thesis-changing, as we worry about Tesla\u2019s new execution risk profile, see considerable downside risk to 2026+ earnings estimates, and believe the stock would need to undergo a potentially painful shift in ownership base, with investors focused on Tesla\u2019s EV volume domination and cost advantage potentially throwing in the towel, and eventually replaced by AI/tech investors with considerably longer time horizons.\"\nThe rise in broader market volatility in the past week hasn't been kind to two former pandemic stock darlings.\nShares of Zoom (ZM) hit a fresh low on Tuesday, down about 90% from their October 2020 peak. Not much buying at these lows is happening in the premarket today.\nMeanwhile, shares of Peloton (PTON) also hit fresh lows on Tuesday. The stock has crashed 98% since its December 2020 highs as people have returned to pumping iron in $50-a-month gyms.\nTesla (TSLA) has had an awful start to 2024. Full stop.\nLayoff news this week was more widespread than initially thought. Analysts are chopping estimates going into the EV company's coming earnings release. Cybertruck deliveries are reportedly being delayed. And Musk scrapped the cheap Tesla he has long promised.\nThe chart below from RBC Capital Markets this morning (where RBC joined other banks and cut their estimates on Tesla) nicely captures the entirety of this mess.\n"

        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 5.9% in the afternoon session after peer, AMD, reported reported first quarter results which highlighted a material increase in its inventory levels. In addition, AMD's guidance for the next quarter was underwhelming as revenue projection was mostly in line with Wall Street's projections.\nSuper Micro Computer, another beneficiary of the current AI wave, reported underwhelming earnings as revenue fell below Wall Street's expectations, with the company calling out supply chain challenges. Like AMD, Super Micro provides data center infrastructure (servers, GPUs, and storage solutions) that power AI models. These include customized cooling racks that enable AI models to deliver better performance.\nOverall, the underwhelming results and mixed outlook provided by these semiconductor players suggest the era of hypergrowth that has propelled the valuation of some of the leading innovators in the AI space might be cooling off as investors become increasingly cautious.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 11 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago, when the company gained 6.2% as markets rallied, with the Nasdaq up 2.1%, while the S&P rose 1.1%, following strong earnings from big tech companies including Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. Notably, the earnings highlighted the strong demand for AI solutions, including cutting-edge AI chips that power most AI applications. These chips are developed by Nvidia and its peers.\nFor example, during its Q1'2024 earnings call, Meta raised its forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year. The increased costs are related to the company's AI infrastructure. It also released its AI assistant, Meta AI. This product was rolled out across its family of apps and is powered by Llama 3, an open-source large language model that is a ChatGPT competitor.\nAlso, during its earnings, Microsoft noted that its operating cash flow was impacted by higher capital expenditures to support cloud and AI offerings, and guided for \"capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments.\" Lastly, Alphabet struck a similar tone, adding during its earnings, \"You can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures. This will fuel growth in cloud help us push the frontiers of AI models.\"\nOverall, the future looks promising for Nvidia as it continues to meet growing market demand within the AI space.\nNvidia is up 72.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $829.38 per share it is still trading 12.7% below its 52-week high of $950.02 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $18,394.\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Lambda has secured a $500 million loan from lenders including Macquarie Group with Nvidia's much-coveted chips as collateral, the specialty artificial intelligence cloud provider said on Thursday.\nStartups addressing the towering need for chips and software that can support AI's complex computing requirements have been luring private investors.\nFirms across the board have been vying to develop their own generative AI (genAI) offerings as they look to capture a share of the increasingly competitive AI market.\nThis has added to the allure of fast AI chips with millions of transistors and their subsequent shortage, making graphics processing units (GPUs) such as those offered by industry leader Nvidia a prized possession.\nThe so-called \"special purpose GPU financing vehicle\", under which Lambda has secured funds, is an asset-based structure secured by GPUs and supported by their cash flow generation, the company said. Asset-based financing involves lenders providing funds against a company's assets as collateral.\n\"Lambda will use the funding to dramatically scale its GPU Cloud, featuring NVIDIA H100s,\" the company said.\nThe financing will also be used to buy Nvidia's H200 chips as well as its latest Blackwell AI chips including B200 and GB200.\nThe B200 AI chip will be priced between $30,000 to $40,000, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had told CNBC in March.\nNvidia had said in November last year that Lambda will be among one of the first cloud service companies to provide access to its H200 chips.\nThe loan also involved investment adviser Industrial Development Funding and follows the $320 million funding round led by billionaire Thomas Tull's US Innovative Technology in February.\nLazard served as exclusive financial adviser and placement agent to Lambda on this transaction, the company said.\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)\n"

Meta released the first MTIA product last year.\nMeta\u2019s pivot to AI services has brought increased demand for computing power. Last year, the social media giant released its own version of an AI model to compete with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. It also added new generative AI features to its social apps, including customized stickers and celebrity-faced chatbot characters.\nIn October, the company said it would spend as much as $35 billion on infrastructure to support AI, including data centers and hardware. \u201cAI will be our biggest investment area in 2024,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg told investors that month.\nA significant amount of that spending will likely still flow to Nvidia, which builds the popular H100 graphics cards that power AI models. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg said the company would acquire 350,000 of those chips, which cost tens of thousands of dollars each.\nBut there\u2019s a growing movement among tech giants to develop chips in-house. Meta is joining rivals Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google in trying to wean themselves off a very expensive dependency. It won\u2019t be a quick fix, though. So far, the efforts haven\u2019t made a dent in the industry\u2019s insatiable need for Nvidia\u2019s AI accelerators.\nThe AI boom has helped turn Nvidia into the world\u2019s third-most-valuable tech company, behind only Microsoft and Apple Inc. Its sales to data center operators totaled $47.5 billion in fiscal 2024, up from just $15 billion the year before.

        "Author": "  Ian King ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. is rolling out a new version of its artificial intelligence chip, aiming to challenge Nvidia Corp. in one of the fastest-growing parts of the semiconductor industry.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIsrael Versus Iran \u2014 What All-Out War Could Look Like\nTexas Warns of Possible Power Emergency Next Week\nIran\u2019s Missile Barrage Was an Error Israel Can Gain From\nIsrael Grapples With New Phase in its Multi-Front War With Iran\nA $150 Billion Fortune Bolsters Qatari Royals at Critical Moment\nThe updated processor, called Gaudi 3, will be widely available in the third quarter, Intel said at a company event Tuesday. The chip is designed to boost performance in two key areas: helping train AI systems \u2014 a process that involves bombarding them with data \u2014 and running the finished software.\nBooming demand for AI services has sent tech companies scrambling for these so-called accelerator chips, but Nvidia has seen most of the benefit. Earlier versions of Gaudi failed to achieve the market share gains that Intel had been hoping for, Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger has said. He expects the new model to have a bigger impact.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a good competitor, but people want an alternative,\u201d he said Tuesday of Nvidia. \u201cThe world needs more suppliers, and we\u2019re quite dedicated to providing that choice.\u201d\nIntel shares gained were up less than 1% at $38 as of 1:33 p.m. in New York on Tuesday, reversing an earlier decline. They had been down 24% this year through Monday\u2019s close.\nGelsinger declined to give pricing but said that his chips would be \u201ca lot below\u201d the cost of Nvidia\u2019s current and future chips. They\u2019ll provide an \u201cextremely good\u201d total cost of ownership, he said.\nChallenging Nvidia won\u2019t be easy. The runaway success of that company\u2019s H100 accelerator helped more than double revenue and sent its market valuation over $2 trillion. And now Nvidia is looking to build on its lead with a just-announced chip platform called Blackwell. Systems based on that product will be available later this year, the company said in March.\nRead More: Nvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell Chips\nAccording to Intel\u2019s assessment, Gaudi 3 will be faster and more power-efficient than the H100. It will train certain types of AI models 1.7 times more quickly and be 1.5 times better at running the software, the chipmaker claims. The product will be roughly equal with Nvidia\u2019s newer H200, Intel said, performing slightly better in some areas and a bit behind in others.\nIntel, based in Santa Clara, California, said it can\u2019t provide comparisons with Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell line until those products are publicly available. Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. \u2014 its longtime competitor in personal computer processors \u2014 also is pushing into the field. It unveiled an accelerator lineup called MI300 in December.\nIntel\u2019s Gelsinger has said that he\u2019s not just trying to catch up with Nvidia. He expects AI to bring a bigger windfall for the industry \u2014 especially as the technology spreads beyond its current concentration in the data centers of companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Personal computers, mobile phones and networking gear will require chips that are able to handle AI tasks and provide users with instantaneous feedback \u2014 something that\u2019s not always possible with remote server farms.\nWhen Intel announced its fourth-quarter results in late January, Gelsinger said he was increasing the supply of Gaudi to meet growing orders and that the company has a \u201cpipeline\u201d for 2024 of \u201cabove $2 billion and growing.\u201d The broader market for corporate spending on generative AI gear will increase from $40 billion in 2024 to $151 billion in 2027, Intel said, citing market research.\nBut that just underscores how much of a lead Nvidia has. The company had data center revenue of more than $47 billion during the 12 months ended in January. In its current fiscal year, that total will top $95 billion, according to analysts\u2019 estimates.\n(Updates with CEO comment starting in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging\nRace for AI Supremacy in Middle East Is Measured in Data Centers\nCocoa\u2019s Surge Is Drawing Africa\u2019s Farmers Back to the Bean\nToyota Pins Its Hopes on Revamped 4Runner to Beat Ford and Hyundai\nEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "Text": "In the wake of the recent, large drop in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock, positive comments about the company by a top analyst who specializes in the chips space, strong quarterly financial results by the firm\u2019s main supplier, and Chinese entities\u2019 purchase of Nvidia\u2019s chips, I\u2019ve become significantly more bullish on Nvidia stock.\nThat\u2019s because I now believe that Nvidia\u2019s AI chips business is strong enough to thrive despite the increased competition that the firm is encountering, while the shares\u2019 valuation provides a sufficient cushion against both this stepped-up competition and the likely, future downturn of cryptocurrencies.\nAs a result, I recommend that investors looking for exposure to a large, well-established firm at the heart of the AI revolution buy relatively small amounts of Nvidia stock.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nNvidia stock declined 14% in the month that ended on April 21, and the shares were nearly 18% off their all-time high as of pre-market trading on April 23. As a result, the name now has a forward price-earnings ratio of 33.11 times. With analysts, on a average, expecting the firm\u2019s earnings per share to jump to $24.76 this year from $12.96 last year, the stock\u2019s P/E ratio is fairly low, given the chip maker\u2019s growth outlook.\nMeanwhile, Stacy Rasgon, a well-respected chip analyst at investment bank Bernstein, recently said that NVDA is still benefiting from \u201cgood \u2026 demand,\u201d while the firm does not appear to have experienced any \u201corder cancellations.\u201d Moreover, the sales of its recently increased products are growing, and its business is unlikely to experience a correction anytime soon, Rasgon said.\nNvidia\u2019s main supplier, Taiwan Semi (NYSE:TSM), reported strong first-quarter results earlier this month as its revenue climbed 13% year over year and its net income jumped 9% versus the same period a year earlier.\nAnd more importantly, TSM expects its sales to surge 20% to 25% for the full year. Unsurprisingly, TSM noted that \u201cinsatiable AI-related demand for energy efficient computing power,\u201d had driven its strong financial results and impressive guidance. Since Nvidia is the leading supplier of AI chips, it should benefit from the \u201cinsatiable\u201d demand that TSM described.\nOn April 23, Reuters reported that \u201cChinese research institutes\u201d had purchased Nvidia\u2019s top chips, despite restrictions that Washington had placed on the export of such chips. As a result, I believe that Nvidia\u2019s revenue from China will be higher than expected, increasing the likelihood that its Q1 results will meet or exceed Wall Street\u2019s average estimates.\nAlso noteworthy is that the \u201cbiggest cloud providers\u201d in America are reportedly poised to spend very large amounts of money on NVDA\u2019s chips.\nAs I noted in a previous column, Nvidia is facing major, competitive threats from a multitude of companies, including the major cloud providers themselves, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). And there have been signs that the inventories of a number of its customers are starting to build.\nOver time, I believe that these factors are likely to put significant, downward pressure on the firm\u2019s average selling prices and margins.\nMeanwhile, with Congress looking likely to pass a bill that would force crypto sellers to follow bank secrecy laws, I expect Nvidia\u2019s crypto business to come under significant pressure in the not-too-distant future.\nNvidia\u2019s business still appears strong despite the increased threats that it\u2019s facing, while its valuation has dropped a great deal and appears to be attractive. Given these points, I have become more bullish on the shares but continue to view them as a cautious buy.\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in INTC.

        "Author": "  Beth McKenna, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) have grown at a torrid triple-digit percentage pace for three consecutive quarters. And investors should be able to count on the tech giant's streak extending to four quarters. For the quarter that ends in late April, management guided for the company's top and bottom lines to surge 234% and 396%, respectively, year over year.\nNvidia's powerful financial results have propelled its stock to tremendous gains. In the fiscal first quarter of 2024, Nvidia stock rocketed 82.5%, making it the second-best performer on the S&P 500 index, and its long-term performance is even more impressive. (Super Micro Computer, a server specialist, was the index's top performer in Q1.)\nThe primary catalyst behind Nvidia's rapid business growth is incredibly strong demand for its chips and related products that accelerate the processing of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads in data centers. Graphics processing unit (GPU) chips have emerged as the best type of general chips for this purpose -- and Nvidia is the leading maker of discrete GPUs. Discrete means the GPUs are distinct chips, as opposed to being integrated with a central processing unit (CPU) chip.\nEstimates vary, but it's widely projected that Nvidia has a roughly 90% share of the data center AI GPU chip market, and about an 80% share of the entire data center AI chip market. The latter includes the custom AI processing chips that some of the larger tech companies have developed.\nNvidia's data center business was already growing at a robust rate over the long term before a new type of AI -- generative AI -- arrived on the tech scene. This occurred in late 2022 when OpenAI broadly released its ChatGPT chatbot. Generative AI opens up a massive range of potentially new applications for AI, so companies are eager to incorporate it into their businesses. This eagerness has lit a fire under Nvidia's sales of its family of data center products.\nIt's natural for investors to wonder if the other companies that make GPU chips -- namely, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel -- or companies that could enter this business will eventually catch up to or even surpass Nvidia in the AI GPU chip market.\nSure, competitors could gain some market share. That's largely because Nvidia can't keep up with the voracious demand for its data center GPUs and associated products. However, it will be nearly impossible for any company to steal Nvidia's AI GPU chip crown, in my view. Moreover, it's unlikely that a competitor will even get close to Nvidia's market share in AI-enabling GPUs.\nWhy?\nThe company addressed this topic in its February annual 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):\nOur AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. [Emphasis mine] Our computing platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and CSP [cloud service provider], as well as on our own AI supercomputers. There are over 4.7 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. [Emphasis mine. Yes, the number of developers is where the article's heading comes from.]\nCUDA is Nvidia's programming model that enables its GPUs to possess the parallel processing capabilities needed for accelerating general and AI computing. Not only are a huge number of developers using CUDA, but many of them have been doing so for a long time, as Nvidia developed CUDA in 2006.\nA virtuous circle (or cycle), according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, is \"a chain of events in which one desirable occurrence leads to another which further promotes the first occurrence and so on...\" In Nvidia's case, this virtuous circle works in a similar way as I recently described it operating for Arm Holdings, the leading designer of CPU chips:\nThe more hardware built using Arm IP, the more software that's written for Arm. And the more software that's written for Arm, the more popular hardware based on its IP [intellectual property] becomes because that hardware has more or better applications and features. And so on and so on.\nIn short, Nvidia's big head start in the AI GPU space has led to it benefitting from a virtuous circle. And this virtuous circle provides it with a tight grip on the AI GPU market.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The critical role that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) plays in the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology thanks to the massive computing power of its graphics processing units (GPUs) explains why the company witnessed an outstanding surge in its revenue and earnings in recent quarters.\nIn its recently concluded fiscal 2024, revenue was up 126% to $60.9 billion. In the current fiscal year, analysts expect another stellar revenue gain of 96% to $110.6 billion. Meanwhile, analysts expect the company's bottom line to double this year, though it could outperform on that front, as it enjoys immense pricing power in the AI GPU market.\nAll of this suggests that Nvidia should be able to justify its expensive valuations. It trades at 75 times trailing earnings, but the forward earnings multiple of 35 tells us just how rapidly its bottom line is expected to grow. What's more, Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) stands at just 0.13. A PEG ratio of less than 1 is viewed as indicating that a stock is undervalued with respect to the growth it is expected to deliver.\nHowever, cautious investors who have doubts about Nvidia's growth story may not be comfortable buying it at these valuations after the 225% surge that the stock saw in the past year. But for investors looking to buy a value play in the AI space right now, Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) looks like an ideal stock pick.\nDell's business consists of two segments. The first is infrastructure solutions, through which the company sells storage and server solutions along with networking products and services. The second segment is client solutions, which includes sales of workstations, personal computers (PCs), and other peripherals.\nThe good news for Dell investors is that both these segments are on track to win big from the rising adoption of AI.\nThe company's infrastructure business is getting a nice bump from sales of AI servers, which are used for mounting chips from Nvidia and others. In the fourth quarter of Dell's fiscal 2024 (which ended Feb. 2), its infrastructure solutions segment delivered $9.3 billion in revenue. Though that was a drop of 6% year over year, it was a gain of 6% sequentially thanks to the growing demand for AI-optimized servers.\nDell shipped $800 million worth of AI servers during the quarter, and that metric is likely to head higher as orders for AI servers increased 40% sequentially last quarter, boosting Dell's AI server backlog to $2.9 billion. Its AI server-related order book should keep getting fatter -- according to a forecast from Global Market Insights, the AI server market's revenue will jump from $38 billion in 2023 to $177 billion in 2032.\nThe company is already witnessing a \"strong interest in orders\" for next-generation chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, which is another indication that its AI-specific server orders are set to move higher.\nSimilarly, Dell expects the advent of AI to drive a turnaround in its client solutions business as well, which has been under stress thanks to declining PC sales. Client solutions revenue was down 12% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter to $11.7 billion. However, the sequential decline was just 5%.\n\"PCs will become even more essential as most day-to-day work with AI will be done on the PC,\" Dell COO Jeffrey W. Clarke said on the Feb. 29 earnings call. The company already announced a new lineup of commercial PCs with integrated AI functionalities to capitalize on this opportunity. This is a smart thing to do, as shipments of AI-enabled PCs are expected to take off this year.\nMarket research firm Canalys predicts that AI-enabled PC shipments will hit 48 million units in 2024, 100 million units in 2025, and 205 million units in 2028. Canalys also points out that AI PCs are likely to carry price premiums of 10% to 15% over traditional PCs. Given that Dell is the third-largest PC original equipment manufacturer and controlled just over 15% of this market in 2023, it is positioned to benefit from this fast-growing niche.\nThese AI-related catalysts explain why analysts have been significantly raising their revenue growth expectations for Dell of late.\nDell's top-line performance is anticipated to improve over the next three fiscal years, and that revenue growth is expected to filter down to the bottom line as well.\nDell is currently trading at just under 25 times trailing earnings. Its forward earnings multiple is even cheaper at 15.7. For comparison, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index has a trailing earnings multiple of 31 and forward earnings multiple of 27. Assuming the company does achieve $9.53 per share in earnings in fiscal 2027 and trades at 27 times earnings at that time (using the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple as a proxy for tech stocks), its stock price could jump to $257 in three years.\nThat would be a 100% jump from current levels. Dell has already gained 210% in the past year, but don't be surprised to see this tech stock deliver eye-popping gains in the future as well thanks to its improving AI credentials. That's why investors looking to buy a growth stock that's not ridiculously expensive should consider adding Dell Technologies to their portfolios before it surges higher.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dell Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Dell Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a definite mover and shaker in recent years. The company has become the world's No. 1 artificial intelligence (AI) chip designer, holding 80% of the market. And this has translated into skyrocketing earnings, with revenue and net income soaring in the triple digits last year. And Nvidia continues to innovate, recently announcing the upcoming launch of a new chip architecture -- the Blackwell platform -- and its most powerful chips ever.\nThis tech company isn't one to sit still, so it's natural that investors love to try predicting its next big move. And right now, I'm going to jump in and share my prediction of what we might expect next from Nvidia. I'll give you a clue: The company's stock has soared past a level that, in the past, coincided with a key decision.\nNvidia shares have climbed more than 240% over the past year, bringing the company's market value to $2.2 trillion, and today trade at the record level of more than $900. Back in May of 2021, when its stock was trading for about $700, Nvidia announced a 4-for-1 stock split and aimed to win approval during its June annual meeting.\nI predict this scenario could happen again this spring -- with an announcement potentially during the company's next earnings report in May -- as Nvidia prepares for its next shareholder meeting. That's likely to take place in June if we consider calendars from previous years.\nWhy do I think Nvidia will make the move soon? For a few reasons. First, as mentioned, Nvidia's last stock split happened when the company's stock price reached similar levels. So, the company has been known to announce such an operation after significant gains and as the stock approached $1,000.\nSecond, a stock price near $1,000 or beyond makes it difficult for some investors to get in on the investment opportunity. Sure, fractional shares exist, but some brokerages don't offer them, and in certain cases, investors prefer buying full shares. Also, other investors may worry that even if valuation looks good, a stock still will struggle to advance significantly once it reaches into the thousands of dollars -- and that could make them hesitate before buying a $900 stock.\nBy splitting its stock, a company erases all of those problems, opening the door to a broader range of investors.\nNext, it's important to keep in mind that Nvidia has completed five stock splits in the past, meaning the company is amenable to this kind of action. The earlier splits happened between 2000 and 2007.\nNow, let's consider how a potential split would work and the impact it may have on Nvidia's share performance. During a split, a company offers additional shares to current shareholders to bring down the price of each individual share, while keeping the market value as is. The resulting stock price is determined by the ratio of the split, whether it's 4-for-1 like Nvidia's most recent operation or a different proportion.\nIf you're a current shareholder, the value of your investment will remain the same, but you'll find yourself with additional shares.\nStock splits themselves aren't catalysts for share price performance, so I wouldn't count on a potential Nvidia stock split to push the stock higher. To use the past as an example, Nvidia stock didn't immediately rise after the 2021 stock split. The shares did advance later that year, though, but that was thanks to fundamentals, such as gains in revenue.\nThat said, a stock split, by making the shares more accessible to a wide range of investors, may prompt more and more of them to consider the stock rather than to opt for lower-priced players. This is positive over the long term, but doesn't result in sudden share price gains.\nSo, my prediction is the moment is right for Nvidia to split its stock, and it may be the company's next big move. But it doesn't matter whether you buy the stock today or after a potential split -- in both cases, you could win by getting in on this great long-term AI story.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +0.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.9% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has lost 5.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $5.48 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +402.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $23.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +84%. This estimate has changed +1.7% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.20 indicates a change of +14.1% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.4%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $24.17 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +236.1%. The $105.87 billion and $124.77 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +73.8% and +17.9%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNvidia reported revenues of $22.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +265.3%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.82%. The EPS surprise was +13.41%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In the generative artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend, there's arguably no bigger winner than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- the chipmaker that produces the hardware needed to train and run these applications. The company's \"picks and shovels\" approach has made it a Wall Street darling, with shares up by a whopping 78% in 2024. \nBut should investors keep piling into the stock? Let's dig deeper to find out what the next five years could have in store. \nAt first glance, the company's parabolic rally over the last two years might look like a classic speculative bubble, but this doesn't seem to be the case. The company's fundamentals justify its stock-price performance, and stellar fourth-quarter results highlight its ongoing momentum. \nNvidia's revenue jumped 265% to $22.1 billion, based on sales of advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) used by data center clients to build and run their AI infrastructure. This is expensive hardware -- with prices for Nvidia's flagship h100 hovering around $40,000 per unit on third-party marketplaces, according to CNBC. And the changing product mix has boosted the company's gross margin, which rose 12.7 points to 76% in the period. \nDespite operating in such a lucrative industry, Nvidia faces limited competition. Rival AMD has been relatively slow to ramp up sales of its competing MI300X AI chips. And while big customers like Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla are investing in proprietary GPUs tailored to their specific workloads, Nvidia is also targeting this market through its own custom chips, which could take advantage of its economies of scale and manufacturing expertise to dominate the $30 billion opportunity. \nNvidia is the right company at the right time to benefit tremendously from the rapid growth of generative AI -- a market Bloomberg expects to be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032. If AI reaches these lofty expectations, Nvidia should continue posting market-beating growth and possibly become the most valuable company in the world. With a market cap of $2.2 trillion, it's already in third place behind Microsoft and Apple. \nEven in a best-case scenario, Nvidia's revenue growth will probably slow down as the industry consolidates and clients stockpile the hardware needed for their AI ambitions. But Nvidia can keep the competition at bay through its relentless innovation. The chipmaker continues to release new products, such as its GB200 (expected to ship this year), which delivers 30X the inference for large language models (LLMs), compared to the company's current flagship GPU, the h100. \nInference refers to the running of generative AI applications. Faster chips like the GB200 could help clients operate ever larger and more complex LLMs while fulfilling user search queries faster. With 25x the energy efficiency of the H100, the new chip can also make data center operations more profitable. There's plenty of incentive for existing clients to continually upgrade to Nvidia's latest products to stay competitive. \nWhile Nvidia looks like the perfect company, investors shouldn't overlook potential risk factors that could develop over the coming years. For starters, generative AI businesses will need to start generating profits to justify the continued purchase of Nvidia's expensive hardware.\nIn February, the Verge reported that it expects 2024 to be a year of reckoning for the industry, as high expectations will need to translate into cash flow and earnings. It remains to be seen how this will play out. But Nvidia's modest valuation of just 37 times forward earnings seems to price in potential risks, and the stock is still a buy. \nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "In 2024, the global semiconductor (or chip) market is projected to grow more than 13% to nearly $600 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Moreover, this market should reach $1 trillion in revenue by 2030, per top consulting firm McKinsey & Company. These rosy growth projections are being driven by several massive global trends that are in their early innings, including artificial intelligence (AI), vehicle electrification, and autonomous driving, according to McKinsey.\nBuying Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is one way to gain exposure to these trends. The company's graphics processing unit (GPU) chips have a dominant share of the data center AI market, whose growth has greatly accelerated due to generative AI. (This is the tech behind OpenAI's incredibly popular chatbot, ChatGPT.) And while Nvidia's auto business is still relatively small, it has the potential for huge growth once driverless vehicles become legal across the United States and beyond.\nSome investors are understandably hesitant to buy Nvidia stock after its rapid run-up. The stock has soared 233% and 480% over the last year and three years, respectively, as of April 12. One great way to get considerable exposure to this top-performing stock but with less risk than buying it is to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is heavily weighted with Nvidia stock: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH).\nAmong semiconductor ETFs with at least a three-year trading history, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has the best returns over the short, medium, and longer terms.\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF began trading in December 2011, so it has a solid track record, at least compared other semiconductor ETFs. It's easily outperformed the S&P 500 index (widely considered the best proxy for the overall U.S. stock market) over the short, medium, and longer terms, as shown below.\nETF/Index\nYear-To-Date 2024 Return\n1-Year Return \n3-Year Return\n5-Year Return\n10-Year Return\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF\n26.2%\n77.4%\n78.4%\n305%\n1,030%\nS&P 500\n7.9%\n27.2%\n30.1%\n91.6%\n240%\nData source: YCharts. Data as of April 12, 2024.\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF is an index fund that's designed to track the performance of the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. This index consists of a portfolio of worldwide companies involved in the semiconductor value chain -- from chip design and production to the manufacturing of equipment used for making chips. As this index's name suggests, it has 25 stock holdings and all the stocks are listed on a major U.S. stock exchange.\nIt's a positive that the index upon which this ETF is based favors large companies, in my view. Large companies in the semiconductor space benefit from economies of scale, including usually having greater bargaining power with suppliers and subcontractors than their smaller peers.\nThis ETF has a reasonable total expense ratio of 0.35%.\nHolding No. \n Company\nMarket Cap \nWall Street's Projected Annualized EPS Growth Over Next 5 Years\nWeight (% of Portfolio)*\n5-Year Return\n1\nNvidia\n$2.2 trillion\n37.9%\n20.39%\n1,770%\n2\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM)\n$739 billion\n4.3%\n12.70%\n282%\n3\nBroadcom\n$623 billion\n14.4%\n7.93%\n398%\n4\nASML Holding \n$378 billion\n21.7%\n4.93%\n401%\n5\nMicron Technology\n$136 billion\n(2.6%)\n4.72%\n197%\n6\nQualcomm\n$191 billion\n8.3%\n4.68%\n240%\n7\nApplied Materials\n$173 billion\n14.3%\n4.51%\n410%\n8\nLam Research\n$125 billion\n9.4%\n4.50%\n428%\n9\nTexas Instruments \n$151 billion\n10%\n4.47%\n63.7%\n10\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)\n$264 billion\n25%\n4.04%\n486%\nTotal Top 10\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n72.87%\nN/A\nOverall ETF\nN/A\nTotal net assets of $18.8 billion\nN/A\n100%\n305%\nN/A\nS&P 500\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n91.6%\nData sources: VanEck Semiconductor ETF, Yahoo! Finance, and YCharts. EPS = earnings per share. *Portfolio weight as of April 11, 2024. All other data as of April 12, 2024.\nThe 10 top holdings above fall into these broad categories:\nChip producers: Nvidia (No. 1), Broadcom (3), Micron (5), Qualcomm (6), Texas Instruments (9), and Advanced Micro Devices (10).\nFoundries: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (2). TSM produces chips for companies that contract out some or all their chip manufacturing. Nvidia is one such company. It's a so-called \"fabless chip maker\" because it doesn't do any of its chip fabrication in-house. Indeed, Wall Street analysts estimate that Nvidia was TSM's second-largest customer in 2023. So TSM is benefiting significantly from Nvidia's incredible growth.\nSemiconductor equipment manufacturers: ASML (4), Applied Materials (7), and Lam Research (8).\nWhat data pops out at you in the above table other than the stock performance data? Perhaps one or both items:\nLargest holding: Nvidia is not only the ETF's largest holding, but it is by far the heaviest weighted. This is a positive if you want considerable exposure to this top-performing stock, but are hesitant to buy it for whatever reason. That could include being concerned it's run up too quickly and is overvalued, or you might simply prefer investing in baskets of stocks within an industry rather than in individual stocks.\nBest projected earnings growth: Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are projected by Wall Street analysts to have the best average annual earnings growth over the next five years. These two companies are the No. 1 (by far) and No. 2, respectively, producers of discrete GPUs. GPUs are the favored chips for training artificial intelligence models and running AI applications in data centers. Given the rapid adoption of AI by companies and other entities, it makes sense that Nvidia and AMD have the highest consensus earnings estimates.\nThe semiconductor industry is poised for decades of strong growth, thanks to several humongous global growth trends that are in their early stages, including AI, the electrification of the world's vehicle fleet, and autonomous driving.\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF is an attractive way for investors to invest in these trends. Its diversification makes it a less risky way to gain exposure to the chip space, relative to buying individual stocks.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

In his response, he reflected on his humble beginnings.\n\u201cTo me, no task is beneath me because remember, I used to be a dishwasher, and I mean that, and I used to clean toilets. I mean, I cleaned a lot of toilets, I've cleaned more toilets than all of you combined, and some of them, you just can't unsee,\u201d he said.\nHuang\u2019s light-hearted remark elicited laughter from the audience.\nHe continued, \u201cI don't know what to tell you, that's life, and so you can't show me a task that's beneath me.\u201d\nHuang emphasizes his willingness to help others by sharing his approach to problem-solving. He states that his assistance is not about whether a task is beneath him but about being of service: by demonstrating his reasoning process on various challenges \u2014 whether they're ambiguous, incalculable, or seemingly daunting \u2014 he empowers others.\nHuang doesn\u2019t hesitate to make bold statements.

Within his company, he uses the term \"pain and suffering\" with glee, seeing such challenges as opportunities to strengthen and refine the character of the organization.\nFor Huang, true greatness in individuals comes from character, not intelligence, and character is shaped by experiences of adversity.\n\u201cAnd so if I could wish upon you \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to do it \u2014 but for all of you Stanford students, I\u2019d wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering,\u201d he said.\nPut simply: no pain, no gain.\nJeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe\u2014 you may want to do the same in 2024\n'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs \u2014 take advantage today\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof \u2014 and only getting worse.

        "Text": "Nvidia\u2019s meteoric rise over the past decade has been a boon for investors seeking exposure to the world or artificial intelligence. The company\u2019s dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs) has begged the question: what are the stocks that could be the next Nvidia?\nThese stocks will often have exposure to the semiconductor and AI industries. With the increasing demand for advanced computing solutions, including data centers, gaming, and machine learning models, the search for the next market leaders intensifies. As the stock market lays the foundation for the next bull cycle, these companies stand at the forefront of the race to refine modern technology.\nNow, let\u2019s unravel the up-and-coming stocks that could be the next Nvidia!\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is undoubtedly among the best of stocks that could be the next Nvidia. They are currently one of the most important chip companies in the world, and are crucial to the acceleration of AI workloads and data center connectivity.\nBroadcom\u2019s strength lies in its development of critical infrastructure components that underpin the growth of AI. The company\u2019s data center solutions include high-speed networking chips and connectivity devices. This is what forms the backbone of computing clusters that power AI applications. Additionally, their Trident 5-X12 chip is the first ever switch with on-chip neural network. This on-chip allows for classification almost instantaneously.\nThe company saw record annual revenue and FCF in FY23, primarily driven by investments in network connectivity for AI hyperscalers. They achieved record adjusted EBITDA margin of 65%, while generating record FCF of $17.63 billion. Furthermore, the VMWare acquisition is set to be immediately cash flow positive. The company expects mid to high digit revenue growth in FY24, and their revolutionary AI chip could be the catalyst for multibagger returns.\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been one of the best performing technology stocks in 2024. They are a leader in high-performance computing (HPC) systems, with the goal of building powerful, energy-efficient servers optimized for demanding AI workloads.\nSuper Micro\u2019s secret sauce lies in its innovative hardware designs. The company utilizes its own motherboard designs and integrates them with the latest processors from companies like Nvidia, AMD and Intel. This approach allows for superior performance and customization. Furthermore, their next-generation liquid cooling GPUs are currently crushing their competition.\nIn Q2 FY24, Super Micro\u2019s net sales more than doubled to $3.66 billion. Net income swelled to $295.97 billion, with EPS up 62% to $5.10 per share. The company has guided revenue growth in the $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion range, representing approximately $35% YOY growth. With the growing adoption of AI and demand for Super Micro\u2019s energy-efficient servers, they remain one of the top stocks that could be the next Nvidia.\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL), a household name in enterprise software, might be a top contender in the race for the next Nvidia. Their cloud infrastructure business and data center operations make them well positioned to dominate in the AI race over the next decade.\nOne of Oracle\u2019s key strengths is its focus on enterprise-grade AI solutions. Unlike some consumer-facing AI platforms, Oracle caters to specific needs of large enterprises. Gen2 Cloud is growing rapidly, and the company continues to sign new large cloud infrastructure contracts. Total remaining performance obligation increased 29% YOY to over $80 billion, sitting at an all time high in Q3 FY24.\nThe company\u2019s offerings integrate seamlessly with existing enterprise software solutions. Existing Oracle customers are more likely to adopt the company\u2019s AI solutions, while already leveraging their cloud computing services. Furthermore, Oracle is rapidly expanding their data center operations to meet the growing demands of AI workloads. This is truly only the beginning, and the cloud-based future of AI remains extremely promising.\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Author": "  Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's hard to find a stock that's performed better than Nvidia over the last five years. Since 2019, its stock has turned in a mind-boggling 79% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). That means that $10,000 invested five years ago would be worth $187,000 today.\nUnfortunately, there's no way to go back in time. So, what can investors do today to recreate some of that Nvidia lightning in a bottle? One way -- at least in part -- might be to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that focuses on the tech sector.\nSo let's look today at the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: VGT).\nFirst things first. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF is an exchange-traded fund, which means it is a tradeable basket of stocks focused on the tech sector. Top holdings include Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, and, yes, Nvidia.\nCompany Name\nSymbol\nPercentage of Assets\nMicrosoft\nMSFT\n18.3%\nApple\nAAPL\n15.4%\nNvidia\nNVDA\n11.8%\nBroadcom\nAVGO\n4.2%\nSalesforce\nCRM\n2.1%\nAdvanced Micro Devices\nAMD\n2.1%\nAdobe\nADBE\n1.7%\nAccenture\nACN\n1.6%\nOracle\nORCL\n1.5%\nCisco Systems\nCSCO\n1.5%\nData Source: Vanguard.\nOne important aspect of the fund is that it is an index ETF, meaning that it is not actively managed. Instead, the fund seeks to replicate the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Index/Information Technology 25/50 Index -- a basket of small, medium, and large tech sector stocks.\nThanks to this design, the fund's costs remain low, and, as a result, the fund's expense ratio is miniscule: 0.1%. That means for every $10,000 invested in the fund, investors pay only $10 a year in fees.\nIn general, ETFs can be a smart choice for most investors thanks to their built-in diversification. And in the case of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, investors gain exposure to a broad array of tech stocks for a minimal fee. \nGranted, the fund is top-heavy, with roughly 45% of its holdings concentrated in Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia. However, that may not necessarily be a bad thing. Over the past five years, each of those stocks has walloped the S&P 500. \nIn any event, holding shares of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a way for investors to gain exposure to Nvidia while not owning Nvidia shares outright. That can be useful, particularly if investors want to lessen portfolio volatility.\nFurthermore, since the fund owns hundreds of stocks, including small caps, there is upside potential, particularly if one of those small-cap stocks turns into the \"next Nvidia.\"\nFinally, there is the passive income. True, the fund's dividend yield is meager: a mere 0.7%. However, that is more dividend income than an investor would get by owning Nvidia shares alone, which have a dividend yield of only 0.2%.\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a well-constructed, affordable ETF that is a smart buy for many investors. That said, it's not for every portfolio. In particular, its high concentration of tech stocks -- Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in particular -- make it unsuitable for investors with outsize exposure to those stocks already. Moreover, given the fund's undersize dividend yield, income-seeking investors would be wise to look elsewhere.\nHowever, for those looking for a tech-centered ETF with a low expense ratio, this fund is one to keep in mind. Indeed, it could be an excellent vehicle for investors who may have missed out on Nvidia's incredible five-year run but don't want to miss out on the next great tech stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Daniel Loeb Owns $2.2 Billion Worth of These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "When it comes to investing in artificial intelligence (AI), one stock that is absolutely hard to ignore is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company almost single-handedly kicked off the AI revolution by developing the graphics processing units (GPUs) that make AI possible. The results of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28) help illustrate its uncontested success. Revenue of $61 billion soared 126% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.93 surged 586%.\nI have no doubts that Nvidia will continue to succeed, but others have doubts. The potential for cyclicality in the chip industry, a frothy valuation, and rising fears of competition have some investors looking for viable alternatives, and following the example of a successful money manager might provide ideas.\nBillionaire Daniel Loeb made his bones as the CEO of Third Point, the hedge fund he founded in 1995. From seed capital of just $3.4 million, Loeb spun that into a financial empire worth $6.6 billion. He's made no secret about his feelings regarding AI, which he views as \"transformational,\" and believes a \"profound economic upheaval\" is under way. While there are many stocks that will reap the benefits of generative AI, a quick look at Third Point's holdings reveals three that have the Loeb seal of approval -- and none of them are named Nvidia.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) deserves at least partial credit for helping to spark the AI revolution by integrating AI across a wide range of its cloud and software offerings. There's perhaps no bigger potential opportunity for the company than that represented by Copilot, Microsoft's AI-powered digital assistant. Copilot offers a suite of tools that help automate and streamline mundane and time-consuming tasks, thereby boosting productivity. According to Microsoft, demand has been off the charts and users seem to love it.\nLoeb has been incredibly bullish and has minced no words about its potential. \"Microsoft's introduction of its AI-assisted Office Copilot software ... could increase its revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\"\nThird Point trimmed about 9% of its position in Microsoft in Q4, even as the value of the position rose -- thanks in part to the stock's 19% gains during the quarter.\nMicrosoft stock was selling for a modest premium at 34 times earnings, but the company has only just begun to reap the rewards of its AI strategy, and Loeb obviously believes it's worth every penny -- and so do I.\nLoeb has been a firm believer in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which he first invested in years ago. He provided insight into his thinking in early 2022. At the time, the company's market cap clocked in at $1.6 trillion, and Loeb opined that the company had $1 trillion in \"untapped value.\" He estimated that the e-commerce segment alone was worth more than $1 trillion, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- its cloud infrastructure segment -- was worth another $1.5 trillion. For context, Amazon's current market cap is $1.9 trillion, so there's still significant upside ahead.\nLoeb believes the \"most direct consequence\" of the rapid adoption of generative AI is that there will be \"an acceleration in cloud usage\" in order to tap the large language models that underpin AI -- including those offered by Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Alphabet's Google Cloud. He called cloud services the \"'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush and should benefit regardless of which products ultimately 'strike gold'.\"\nLoeb also trimmed his Amazon holdings by about 10% but, like Microsoft, the total value of his stake actually rose, thanks to a 20% increase in Amazon's stock price in the fourth quarter.\nHowever, at less than 3 times sales to close out 2023, Amazon was, and still is, attractively priced.\nLoeb's substantial position in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is at least partially explained by the ongoing rebound in the digital advertising market, but the company also has a sizable opportunity when it comes to AI. Loeb initiated a position in Q3 and added to it in Q4. Meta has long employed AI to serve relevant content to its social media users and to more accurately target the advertising that provides the lion's share of its revenue.\nMore recently, Meta has unveiled the next generation of its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which is available for hire on all the major cloud infrastructure services. While we don't yet know the significance of its impact on Meta's bottom line, it does represent a new revenue stream for the company.\nWhile Loeb has been mum about his rationale, Meta meets Loeb's criteria of investing in \"high-quality companies trading at reasonable valuations.\" And, as the sun set on 2023, Meta Platforms stock was selling for just 24 times earnings, a discount to a multiple of 26 for the S&P 500.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Will Intel's New Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chip Send It Soaring Past Nvidia?",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is known as the world's top seller of artificial intelligence (AI) chips because its product has been unbeatable so far. The company makes the most powerful chip out there today, helping companies power the tasks of training and inferencing for their AI models. This has helped Nvidia's earnings soar in the triple digits last year -- and its share price followed, with an increase of more than 200% over the past year.\nMeanwhile, rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)\u00a0hasn't fared as well. Lower personal computer demand in recent times has weighed on revenue. On top of this, Intel fell behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip race. All of this has left its shares trading at half their 2020 level.\nThe tide may be about to turn, though, as Intel ramps up its AI portfolio. Just this week, the company announced its new AI chip Gaudi 3. Can this new product send Intel soaring past Nvidia?\nLet's start with some details about this new Intel chip. The company says Gaudi 3 offers 4x more AI compute and a 1.5x increase in memory bandwidth, compared to its predecessor.\nImportantly, Intel's new chip may challenge Nvidia's top-performing graphics processing unit (GPU), the H100. The Gaudi 3 may deliver a 50% faster training time than the H100 when used on certain large language models (LLMs) -- for example, Llama 2.\nIts inference throughput could outperform the H100 by an average of 50%, and the product is more power-efficient than Nvidia's, too. Intel didn't offer a price range for the Gaudi 3 but said it delivers superior performance to the H100 \"at a fraction of the cost.\" The company plans to make Gaudi 3 available to companies that build platforms with these chips in the second quarter.\nDoes this mean Intel could be on the way to unseating Nvidia? Not necessarily.\nIt's important to remember that the Gaudi 3 performance levels are \"on average\" and using certain LLMs at specific parameters. And Nvidia isn't sitting still when it comes to product innovation. The company recently announced its new Blackwell architecture, and its most powerful chips ever, the B100, are set for release later this year.\nEven if Intel's Gaudi 3 outperforms the H100, it's very likely Nvidia will surge into the lead from a performance perspective when it releases the Blackwell platform. I don't see Gaudi 3 as a threat to demand for Nvidia's products or the company's long-term earnings prospects.\nI do see the product as an important catalyst for Intel's earnings and share-price performance. Demand for AI chips is high and likely to keep on growing -- with the AI market forecast to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. It's unlikely that just one company will serve all of this demand.\nHere's another point to keep in mind: Cost is a significant factor that comes into play for many companies as they launch AI programs, and some of them don't necessarily need the world's most powerful chip. This leaves plenty of room for a high-quality product offering great performance at a reasonable price to carve out a spot in the market.\nIntel probably won't soar past Nvidia to become the world's biggest AI chipmaker, but the Gaudi 3 could offer the company a much-needed boost to earnings. As more and more companies -- with a wide range of budgets and needs -- launch AI programs, opportunities will multiply for Intel and other companies producing high-performance chips. Intel's focus on performance at a lower cost could help it carve out a niche.\nAn Intel survey of 430 tech professionals showed that only about 10% of their organizations had sent generative AI models to production last year. This reinforces the idea that we're in the early days of the AI boom.\nAs for share performance, if Gaudi 3 and Intel's other new AI products take off, Intel stock could beat Nvidia when it comes to percentage gains. After declining 45% over the past three years, Intel is ripe for recovery. Trading for 27x forward earnings estimates\u00a0means the stock is reasonably priced.\nWhile the Gaudi 3 launch isn't bad news for Nvidia, it's definitely great news for Intel and its shareholders.\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "All aboard the Nvidia \u2018rocket ship\u2019: Executives are raking in company stock awards despite missing out on their bonuses for 2023",
        "Author": "  Amanda Gerut ",
        "Text": "Only Nvidia, the suddenly indispensable $2 trillion AI giant, could turn a missing C-suite bonus into a total nonissue. The dominant maker of semiconductor chips missed hitting financial goals in fiscal 2023 related to revenue and non-GAAP operating income, and executives didn\u2019t make two key payout thresholds as a result, as corporate disclosures show the company paid zero cash bonuses in fiscal 2023 to its top team and certain performance-based equity awards failed to vest. However, the structure of the company\u2019s equity program and its blockbuster performance have largely inoculated it from major talent defection.\nTake CEO and founder Jensen Huang himself. The board last raised Huang\u2019s bonus pay opportunity in fiscal 2022 to $2 million with an award opportunity of 200% or $4 million, a relatively paltry sum for such an influential tech CEO. His pay stayed at that level until the board\u2019s compensation committee announced a new plan last month for fiscal 2025. (Fiscal year 2025 refers to the company\u2019s fiscal year that ends Jan. 26, 2025.) But the equity program has been worth nearly half a billion dollars for Huang.\nHuang received stock worth $61.8 million in value, in addition to $442.8 million in value he derived from exercising options in fiscal 2023. And even though his top executives missed certain goals and only earned a type of performance share unit award, they hit the lights out. The lowest-paid executive on the top team realized $14.8 million when their 75,510 shares vested in fiscal 2023, company disclosures show.\n\u201cThe calculus that a lot of machine learning engineers are doing right now is between one of two things\u2014join a rocket ship, in which case, Nvidia is about as big of a rocket ship as I can get,\u201d said Khaled Hussein, CEO of tech talent acquisition platform Betterleap. \u201cOr [some engineers] are going to build a rocket ship to do their own thing.\u201d\nHuang\u2019s awards include performance share units that are eligible to vest over a four-year period based on attaining certain annual operating income goals, known as SY PSUs. His pay plan includes a second type of performance share unit award based on three-year total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the S&P 500 that is eligible to vest over three years, known as MY PSUs. Last year, the company missed its non-GAAP operating income goal of $13.2 billion, only hitting $9 billion, and the 2023 SY PSUs therefore failed to vest. However, the company\u2019s three-year relative TSR between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2023 was 189%, landing it at the 99th percentile relative to the S&P 500. Thus, Nvidia\u2019s actual performance exceeded the company\u2019s stretch operating plan goal and the executives earned the maximum vesting of MY PSUs.\n\u201cThis is a fairly competitive program,\u201d said Brittany McCants, a partner at law firm Barnes & Thornburg.\nThe link with TSR is a key long-term aspect of the comp scheme, said McCants. \u201cThe market\u2019s exuberant interest in the company is really highlighted through the story of the precipitous increase in its stock price,\u201d she said. \u201cThat being a significant piece of the compensation package tells me that is the piece of their compensation that people at the executive level will probably value the most.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment.\nAlthough Nvidia didn\u2019t pay any bonuses to executives last year after they failed to hit the revenue goal, recruiters say the threat of talent poaching is low, given Huang\u2019s habit of showering employees with equity awards tied to the stock price, which has risen 81% year to date. Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization famously surpassed $2 trillion in February after it released blowout earnings, making it just the third company to join the multitrillion-dollar valuation club, after Microsoft and Apple.\nThe company\u2019s formidable earnings included record full-year revenue of $60.9 billion, up 126%. Meanwhile, red-hot interest in AI talent fueled a bidding war that has, for instance, moved Elon Musk to raise salaries for Tesla engineers at the risk of their being lured away. Musk said earlier this month that it was the \u201ccraziest talent race\u201d he\u2019d ever seen\u2014even more than the 2015 occasion when he lured Ilya Sutskever, a key brain behind the rise of OpenAI, away from Google cofounder Larry Page.\nBut despite Nvidia\u2019s rising popularity and the mainstreaming of AI, Huang\u2019s team is devoted to his vision, the company, and the potential millions in stock they can unlock if they hold their equity.\n\u201cNvidia is public so those shares are as good as cash, and people are hanging on to their shares,\u201d said Hussein. \u201cNobody is selling.\u201d\nLast year, the company missed its revenue goal of $29.6 billion for fiscal 2023, only hitting $27 billion, and execs earned zero annual bonuses as a result. A year later in March 2024, the Nvidia board announced that it was hiking its annual cash bonus plan for Huang in fiscal 2025 just weeks after the company announced record quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion, an increase of 22% from the previous quarter and up 265% from a year ago.\nNotably, Huang saw his bonus opportunity rise from a possible $4 million in fiscal year 2024, to $6 million for fiscal 2025. It marked the third time the Nvidia board has bumped up Huang\u2019s annual cash bonus in the past five years. Bonuses at Nvidia are earned based on hitting revenue goals and Huang\u2019s is set as a percentage of his base salary.\nLike most tech companies, the lion\u2019s share of Nvidia executives\u2019 pay is delivered in the form of equity. Nvidia is known as a company that doesn\u2019t pay the high salaries or sky-high bonuses of, for instance, financial services companies, but Huang doles out equity awards to employees because of his long-held confidence that the company will continue to grow and that employees will be enriched by their stakes. The desire among outside firms to entice machine learning engineers, general managers, and executives from Nvidia is strong, but because of the high levels of unvested equity the employees have, recruiters haven\u2019t seen much success in coaxing talent out of the company, search experts said.\nWith some tech companies, there\u2019s sometimes a point at which it becomes possible to try to lure someone away depending on when their equity vests, but with Nvidia\u2019s plan, executives are always seeing upside in the short term, midrange, and long term, said Dora Vell, CEO of Vell Executive Search. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard for somebody to move, unless they\u2019re just not a fit there,\u201d she said.\nOther top executives, including chief financial officer Colette Kress and Ajay Puri, executive vice president of worldwide field operations, saw their bonus targets stay flat for fiscal 2025, based on the March report. However, while 96% of Huang\u2019s total pay is dependent on corporate performance goals, only about 56% of other executives\u2019 pay is dependent on hitting performance goals. And in fiscal 2023, the Nvidia board increased potential payout values for Kress, Puri, EVP of operations Debora Shoquist, and EVP and general counsel Timothy Teter by $2 million, a raise of about 22% for each executive.\nHussein looks at Nvidia and its rivals in the AI space and says, right now, their executives are \u201chaving a moment.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Sydney Lake ",
        "Text": "Nvidia, now one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies with a $2.2 trillion market cap, was formed in an unexpected place. Exactly 31 years ago today, Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem met at a Denny\u2019s restaurant, where Huang had once worked as a dishwasher and busboy.\nWhile Huang has been the face of the world\u2019s premiere advanced chip manufacturer, the company\u2019s other two cofounders still played an important role in Nvidia\u2019s success. Priem served as the chief technical officer for a decade before retiring in 2003\u2014and he could\u2019ve been the 16th-richest person in the U.S. if he hadn\u2019t sold most of his shares in Nvidia after it went public in 1999.\nIndeed, if Priem had held on to all of his shares, he\u2019d be worth $70 billion, according to a Forbes report, but he\u2019s only worth an estimated $30 million as of November 2023. Priem is the forgotten cofounder of Nvidia mostly due to his early retirement, stock sellout, and move off the grid\u2014but he is a remarkable inventor with almost 200 U.S. and international patents as well as a philanthropist who has donated hundreds of millions of his fortune to causes he cares about.\nPriem got his start in electrical engineering at IBM and Sun Microsystems, where the programming language Java was invented. Both Priem and Malachowsky were working at Sun Microsystems when they met with Huang at what was one of Denny\u2019s \u201cmost popular\u201d locations in Northern California to discuss \u201ccreating a chip that would enable realistic 3D graphics on personal computers,\u201d according to an Nvidia blog post.\n\u201cChris and Curtis said one day they\u2019d like to leave [Sun Microsystems], and they\u2019d like me to go figure out what they\u2019re going to leave for,\u201d Huang said during a recent interview with Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cThey insisted I figure out with them how to build a company.\u201d\nEarly on, Priem architected the blueprint that allows engineers to design algorithms for Nvidia\u2019s chips, according to Forbes. These chips now power a slew of technology including AI systems and video game graphics. Because Priem was very much the technical lead behind Nvidia\u2019s original chip designs, it\u2019s no surprise that he stayed in the shadows as the company grew in popularity\u2014and market value.\n\u201cThere was a saying at Nvidia to never put Curtis in front of a camera, and never put Curtis in front of a customer,\u201d Priem told Forbes.\nBy 1999, Nvidia went public with a $1.1 billion market cap, and just months later he established the Priem Family Foundation. Priem put more than three-quarters of his 12.8% (at IPO) Nvidia stake in the foundation. In today\u2019s share count, that would\u2019ve been about 100 million shares. Nvidia declined a Fortune request for comment on Priem\u2019s involvement with the company and why he sold off his shares and retired.\nBy 2006, Priem had sold all of his shares in Nvidia and gone off the grid, moving to a $6 million home in Fremont, Calif., according to Forbes. Now he\u2019s just focused on writing \u201cmanifestos\u201d on solving problems such as \u201crepairing the earth,\u201d although none have been published anywhere.\nBecause Priem has essentially run out of money from selling all of his Nvidia shares and going off the grid, his foundation, which once donated to causes including the Nature Conservancy, holds about $160 million in assets and is set to shutter by 2031, according to Forbes.\nBut a massive share of his wealth went to his alma mater, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where he has donated $275 million since 2001, which accounts for 40% of RPI\u2019s total gifts during that time period.\u00a0 RPI didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment from Fortune regarding Priem\u2019s donations, which have gone to projects at the school including a new concert hall.\nAlthough Priem\u2019s continued involvement with RPI became his \u201cpurpose and my sanity,\u201d he still has regrets about selling his Nvidia stock.\n\u201cI did a little crazy thing,\u201d Priem told Forbes. \u201cAnd I wish I'd kept a little bit more.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": " Karen Friar    and Hamza Shaban    ",
        "Text": "Wall Street retreated on Friday as dimming hopes for a coming interest rate cut and geopolitical uncertainty intensified a sell off in Big Tech.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.9%, notching its sixth consecutive losing day, and suffering its worst losing streak since October 2022. The benchmark index lost more than 3% for the week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 2.1%, falling more than 5% for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) managed to rise about 0.6%.\nDisappointing earnings from Netflix (NFLX) weighed on hopes that quarterly reports would help revive the equity rally. Shares of the streaming giant, the first of the megacap techs to update, slid 9%. Technology stocks as a whole flashed red with all of the biggest names shedding value.\nMarket darling Nvidia (NVDA) lost 10%, while Amazon (AMZN) saw a drop of more than 2%. Apple (AAPL) decreased 1%.\nThe market had come back from a deeper sell-off after Israel's retaliatory strike on Iran spooked traders overnight and spurred a rush to safe havens such as gold. But investors are still on high alert, though Iran has confirmed the drone attack and said it failed.\nStocks were already under pressure before the shock amid persistent uncertainty about Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. A growing number of Fed officials this week expressed a more hawkish stance because of hotter-than-anticipated inflation data in the first quarter.\nMeanwhile, US government bonds pulled back almost fully from their biggest rally of the year. The yield on the safe-haven 10-year Treasury (^TNX) fell to trade around 4.6%.\nIn commodities, Brent crude futures (BZ=F) \u2014 the global oil benchmark \u2014 traded around 0.2% higher to around $87 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CL=F) were up 0.5% to roughly $83 a barrel. Gold (GC=F) increases cooled a bit after earlier earlier gains, trading up 0.2%.\nTwo of the major indexes gave ground on Friday, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) falling into its sixth straight day of losses. Wall Street was mostly in retreat as concerns over interest rates staying elevated took hold alongside rising geopolitical tensions.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.9%, suffering its worst losing streak since October 2022. The benchmark index lost more than 3% for the week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 2.1%, falling more than 5% for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) managed to rise about 0.6%.\nWhen the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year, if it all, continues to dominate the storyline on Wall Street. While Big Tech has so far this year carried the broader market, there's less certainty that even solid earnings reports can keep the momentum going.\nNext week will provide another test of the tech sector's ability to push through an increasingly pessimistic narrative of higher interest rates for longer.\nMeta (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are set to report, coming off of Netflix's (NFLX) disappointing showing. The streaming giant was the first of the megacap stocks to report, weighing on hopes that quarterly reports would help revive the equity rally.\nOn the economic front, first quarter GDP is scheduled to publish on Thursday and another crucial inflation reading, the PCE price index is set to arrive on Friday\nYahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week:\nIf an autonomous future was one pillar supporting Tesla's (TSLA) \"Magnificent\" market valuation, an electric car cheap enough for most families was the other.\nBut changes from inside the company and from outside forces are swiftly complicating that vision.\nTesla's stock price is predicated in part on mass-market EVs and leading the paradigm shift in how most of the country gets around.\nBut sky-high costs for autos \u2014 and especially EVs \u2014 have dampened consumer demand and extended any timelines for adoption.\nWhile governments are set on steering society toward the electric transition, legacy automakers are recalibrating the timing as they adjust to the waning demand. Several big players, including Ford (F) and General Motors (GM), have recently scaled back their EV plans, while others are relying on hybrid vehicles to start the shift.\nJust as competitors are leaning into cheaper hybrids and better-selling gas models, Tesla appears to be pivoting away from its long-anticipated entry-level EV and entrenching its position as a luxury automaker.\nAt the same time, resources for the affordable Model 2 EV project have now been allocated to a farfetched robotaxi plan.\nAgainst an increasingly pessimistic backdrop, the Model 2 was meant to be a shimmering answer to Tesla's short-term woes. But without a daring entry-level vehicle to reinvigorate Tesla's financials, the company's challenges seem less temporary. For some analysts and investors, Tesla doesn't have a future without the Model 2.\nThe idea of driving without human intervention has played a crucial part in Tesla's tech-juiced growth story. But what if it's the only part?\nSurprisingly stubborn inflation has weighed heavily on markets in recent days. And a growing number of Fed officials are throwing cold water on the hopes that a rate cut will soon arrive. What was once a theory of interest rates staying higher for longer is looking more like a new normal.\nCurrent market wagers don't forecast a Fed rate cut until at least September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. That's a long ways off from when most interest rate traders thought the easing cycle would begin. As recently as last month, the markets were projecting a June rate cut. But hotter-than-expected inflation readings have scrambled expectations.\nAs Apollo Global Management\u2019s chief economist Torsten Slok notes, it typically takes eight months from the last Fed hike until the Fed starts cutting. But this cycle is different. The Fed has kept interest rates constant for ten months since the last hike in July 2023, Slok, said in a Friday note. (Disclosure: Apollo is Yahoo's parent company.)\n\"With easy financial conditions still giving a significant boost to inflation and growth over the coming quarters, the risks are rising that we could see a Fed cycle that is very different, with the Fed keeping rates higher for much longer than we usually see,\" he said.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday:\nNvidia (NVDA): The AI chip leader was among a host of tech stocks losing ground on Friday afternoon with the semiconductor sector undergoing a correction as interest rate cut expectations dwindle. Nvidia lost more than 4% alongside other high-growth, technology-driven stocks.\nProcter & Gamble (PG): After topping quarterly earnings estimates and boosting guidance, shares of the consumer goods company fell by by 0.2% as investors focused on sales figures that fell short of expectations.\nNetflix (NFLX): Shares of the streaming giant fell 8 % after the company gave a second quarter revenue forecast that missed estimates and announced it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber metrics closely watched by Wall Street.\nAmerican Express (AXP): Shares of the financial services company gained almost 5% after releasing first quarter earnings that showed an 11% jump in revenue compared to the same period a year ago and beating Wall Street expectations. The credit card company also boasted that Gen Z and millennial customers accounted for more than 60% of new account acquisitions globally in the quarter.\nStocks moved mostly lower Friday afternoon as Big Tech stocks continued a sell-off that sent the S&P 500 back under the 5,000 mark.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 0.2%.\nChicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee became the fourth Fed official this week to strike a more hawkish stance on interest rate policy, signaling that the first long-awaited rate cut might still be months away.\nGoolsbee said Friday that \"progress on inflation has stalled\" and that \"it makes sense to wait\" before cutting rates, Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports.\nThe comments were notable because previously, Goolsbee had been one of the more dovish members of the Fed, known for his view that the Fed was on a \"golden path\" to getting inflation down without high unemployment.\nThe most recent wave of greater caution started with Fed Chair Jay Powell, who said Tuesday that it will take \"longer than expected\" to achieve the confidence needed to get inflation down to the central bank\u2019s 2% target.\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March showed inflation was hotter than expected for the third month in a row.\n\"You never want to make too much of any one month\u2019s data, especially inflation, which is a noisy series,\" Goolsbee said in remarks prepared for a speech before the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing's annual conference. \"But after three months of this, it can\u2019t be dismissed.\"\n\u201cRight now, it makes sense to wait and get more clarity before moving,\" he added.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday:\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI): Shares of the server manufacturer slid more than 16% Friday morning after the company announced the date of its third quarter results but didn\u2019t offer a pre-announcement, which investors perceived as a negative signal, Wells Fargo Securities wrote.\nNetflix (NFLX): Shares of the streaming giant fell 7% after the company gave a second quarter revenue forecast that missed estimates and announced it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber metrics closely watched by Wall Street.\nParamount (PARA): The entertainment company rose 8% Friday morning following a report from\u00a0the New York Times revealing that Sony Pictures Entertainment (SONY) has entered talks with Apollo Global Management (APO), the parent company of Yahoo Finance, to discuss a possible joint buyout bid of Paramount. According to the report, both companies, through a joint venture, would offer cash for shares of Paramount, taking the company private.\nAmerican Express (AXP): Shares of the financial services company gained almost 5% after releasing first quarter earnings that showed an 11% jump in revenue compared to the same period a year ago and beating Wall Street expectations. The credit card company also boasted that Gen Z and millennial customers accounted for more than 60% of new account acquisitions globally in the quarter.\nApple has removed WhatsApp and Threads from its App Store in China following a government order, citing national security concerns.\nThe censorship demands to restrict access to some of the most popular messaging apps marks Beijing's latest effort to exert control through Apple's ecosystem. The move, Reuters reports, also signals a growing intolerance of China's central government toward foreign online messaging services and less leeway given to the iPhone maker to operate there.\n\"The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,\" Apple said in a statement.\nChina's Great Firewall blocks access to these apps, but they are still commonly used by Chinese users through virtual private networks that bypass the restrictions. As the Wall Street Journal reports, Beijing has raised concerns that the apps could be used by citizens to spread information that is otherwise censored by the government or to cause social unrest.\nThe pressure forcing stocks downward mostly did not let up on Friday, as rising geopolitical tensions, disappointing earnings, and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts weighed on Wall Street\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 0.3%,\nInflation may be sticky and damaging many households, but those wealthy households rocking American Express (AXP) cards are still feeling great.\nSo great, Amex saw sales rise 11% in the first quarter the company said this morning.\nHere's what Amex CEO Steve Squeri told me by phone:\n\"We have got a premium consumer, and our premium consumers are feeling good about the economy and feeling good about what they want to do. And yes, inflation is still high, but it's not growing as fast. And the reality is, our consumers are going to spend.\"\nNetflix (NFLX) shares are getting hit premarket after another big quarter on almost every line item.\nIt makes sense; the stock was priced for perfection ahead of the report.\nBut cutting through the noise, this point by Pivotal Research's Jeff Wlodarczak is the most important thing to take away on Netflix at this juncture:\nWith nothing in the report suggesting Netflix's fundamentals are struggling, you have to wonder if the pullback in the stock will be bought at the open today. One could make the argument that the stock isn't even that expensive compared to historical trading norms.\nCheck out the current valuations on Netflix compared to those seen from 2016 to 2021, when the company was in no way as fundamentally strong as it is today. All data is presented to you, of course, by the Yahoo Finance platform.\nYou can analyze more of this data on Netflix by heading to the statistics section on the Netflix ticker page.\n"

        "Title": "Here's Why Shares in This Nvidia Partner Soared in March",
        "Author": "  Lee Samaha, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares in data center equipment company Vertiv Holdings (NYSE: VRT) rose by a whopping 20.8% in March as the company rode the artificial intelligence (AI) investment boom. The stock price took a leg up in mid-March following the announcement that Vertiv would become a Solution Advisor: Consultant partner in the Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Partner Network.\nYou can't have a burgeoning investment in AI applications without data centers, and you can't have data centers without cooling. As such, Vertiv has a critical role in the growth of AI, a fact acknowledged by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) a day after the announcement. Huang noted that Nvidia and Vertiv were working on cooling systems, with Vertiv acknowledged as \"very important\" in ensuring the cooling of data centers.\nWhile that's a red rag to an Nvidia bull, there's reason and hard numbers behind the optimism.\nAs previously discussed, there's been an incredible boom in U.S. manufacturing construction investment over the last couple of years, led by investment in semiconductors and electronics, including data centers. In fact, U.S. manufacturing spending came in at $214 billion in 2023 compared to less than $100 billion in 2022 and even lower in the pre-pandemic era.\nMoreover, the boom in interest in AI has made spending on data centers higher. For example, here's a look at capital expenditures at leading data center company Equinix. Although it dipped through 2022 in line with a correction after the boom inspired by the pandemic, it's now taken off again. Equinix management expects $2.9 billion to $3 billion in capital spending in 2024.\nThe ongoing spending in data centers is also seen in Vertiv's order growth -- up 23% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 18% in the third quarter of 2023. Moreover, CEO Giordano Albertazzi expects spending \"to continue to be strong up in the high teens on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter across the portfolio\" in the first quarter.\nAs such, Vertiv is set for another year of strong growth, and management forecasts call for a double-digit increase in organic revenue for the full year.\nBefore you buy stock in Vertiv, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vertiv wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Correction Helps Advisors Talk Diversification",
        "Author": "  Rob Isbitts ",
        "Text": "If you are an advisor, perhaps you\u2019ve heard of a \u201clittle\u201d $2 trillion computer graphics company that is changing the world. I\u2019m talking, of course, of Nvidia and its recent rise from solid operator to king of the global stock market.\nThat\u2019s what a price move from $110 a share to over $970 in about 18 months for a company that was already a large cap will do, especially in the age where stocks can become almost like superheroes or entertainment icons to investors.\nFor financial advisors, however, when a stock captures the public\u2019s imagination like Nvidia has recently, or Apple and others have done in the past, the temptation is for investors to ignore diversification and take on the persona of a casino gambler. Let it ride! \nBut the ride is often bumpy, or worse. So Nvidia\u2019s rise from roughly $950 to $830 a share in about two weeks\u2019 time is the latest reminder that while the market can put any price on a stock, even the giants of the equity market could use what so many superheroes benefit from: a sidekick!\nIn this case, that can come in the form of advisors using ETFs to have clients own a chunk of their favorites, while supplementing it with diversification in the form of other holdings, either in similar fields or as a step toward spreading the risk. The stock market has been a friendly place to holders of some of the biggest stocks, especially in the technology sector. But advisors only must return to late December to show that Apple Inc. stock fell 15% from where it stood then.\nPerhaps more significantly, highlighting that stocks are not a one-way ticket to paradise helps advisors bust an important myth, which less-experienced investors with shorter memories are likely to miss. For instance, that dip of the Apple had it sitting at the same price per share last Friday that it stood on Christmas Eve\u2026of 2021!\nYet during that same period, the $65 billion SPDR Select Sector Technology ETF (XLK), of which Apple has been roughly a 20% weighting over the past few years, gained 18%. Diversification doesn\u2019t always produce the best short-term returns, but it tends to smooth out the rocky roads that the stock market is famous for.\nNvidia is also part of XLK, but it currently occupies less than 5% of the assets of that ETF. But there are other funds which \u201cfeature\u201d a large portion of Nvidia, but with plenty of cushion around it. One is the $3.6 billion Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which has been around since 2000. Nvidia currently has a nearly 25% weighting in it. So as XLK is to Apple, SMH appears to be to Nvidia.\nGiven that Nvidia is the confirmed world leader (for now) in Artificial Intelligence, it makes sense that the $490 million Global X Robotic & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) would carry a high allocation to the stock. Indeed, it checks in at 20% of BOTZ as of last week.\nThese brief examples are intended to help advisors bring home a key point to clients, not only about the flexibility and usefulness of ETFs as a portfolio construction tool, but also about diversification in a time of \u201csuper stocks.\u201d \nToo much of a good thing can be hazardous to one\u2019s wealth. And with advisors earning much of their income based on the size of client portfolios, doing what they can to prevent maximum losses, if and when superheroes fall, makes a lot of sense for them as well.\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "Title": "Mid-level Nvidia employee retires with $62 million from stock options, while another lost it all \u2014 a story of millionaire winners and losers",
        "Author": "  Mark Tyson ",
        "Text": "The wealth that can be gained from helping to propel a successful company is vividly illustrated by a recent Tweet/X by Barron\u2019s writer Tae Kim. One \u201cmid-level\u201d Nvidia employee accrued a fortune of $62 million, claims Kim. Thus, company share schemes can be a great incentive for employees. However, as a counterpoint, the senior Barron\u2019s reporter also knows of at least one Nvidia employee who made a \u201chalf billion dollar mistake,\u201d after their \u2018green-gold\u2019 slipped through their fingers.\nIn the Tweet above, Kim tells the happy tale of a mid-level Nvidia employee who \u201cmaxed out the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) for 18 years,\u201d and kept a firm hold of this \u2018green gold.\u2019 The employee wasn\u2019t a big shot engineer, it is made clear. They simply took full advantage of the Nvidia ESPP, which allows employees to use between 10-15% of their salary to buy company stock at a 15% discount to the market.\nThis lucky (wise?) employee is said to have left Nvidia with a stack of shares worth $62 million. It must have been hard to hold these shares without sometimes dipping in to take some cash, but Kim asserts that this individual \u201cnever sold during tenure.\u201d We don\u2019t need to say that $62 million is a considerable retirement nest egg, and hope that the ex-employee enjoys the best of health, too.\nAs teased in the intro, not everyone who took advantage of the Nvidia ESPP during the rocket-propelled share valuation gains of recent years fared so well. Kim tells of an early Nvidia employee, an engineer, who once was the proud owner of a million Nvidia shares (a single share is valued at $882 at the time of writing).\nSadly, this employee had to sell up his green gold to pay for losses when his broker \u201cmargined his account with another stock that fell 90%,\u201d explains Kim. A margin account is where you leverage the value of one or more holdings to purchase other stocks or financial assets. In this instance, the forced sell from the margin account led to a \u201chalf billion dollar mistake\u201d according to the source.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we have heard of, or reported on, Nvidia employees and their fortunes. Last November, we wrote about a lesser-known Nvidia co-founder, Curtis Priem (the first Nvidia CFO), who cashed out relatively early. Interestingly Priem\u2019s Nvidia stock would have been worth over $70 billion if he had held onto it. However, this \u2018loss\u2019 seems to be of no concern to Priem, who has an estimated $30 million personal fortune and what sounds like a busy, fulfilling life.\nWe published another fascinating story stemming from Nvidia\u2019s undeniable success in December last year. The headlining employee with $62 million in Nvidia shares might have retired. However, there seems to be a problem at Nvidia with reports of wealthy Nvidia employees operating in semi-retirement mode.\nHey boss, can we have some Future shares? OK, never mind, I\u2019ve just looked at the chart...\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has made a lot of millionaires over the last year as its share price skyrocketed 225%. The company rallied investors as it became the poster child for a boom in artificial intelligence (AI), snapping up an estimated 90% market share in AI chips.\nHowever, the chart above shows that Nvidia's meteoric rise has made it an expensive option compared to other tech stocks. Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio are significantly higher than the same metrics for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\nForward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, P/S divides its market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. These are useful valuation metrics as they consider a company's financial health alongside its share price.\nFor both, the lower the figure, the better the value. As a result, Intel and Apple are trading at a bargain compared to Nvidia.\nSo, forget Nvidia and consider these two millionaire-maker stocks instead.\nShares in Intel have risen more than 135% since it went public in 1971, creating plenty of millionaires along the way.\nHowever, the company has hit a few roadblocks in recent years. Its stock is down about 45% over the past three years after seeing decreased market share in central processing units (CPUs) and the end of a partnership with Apple that lasted more than decade.\nIntel responded to recent headwinds by introducing significant structural changes that could pay off in the coming years. Last June, Intel announced a \"fundamental shift\" to its business, adopting an internal foundry model that it believes will help it save $10 billion by 2025. This would see it adopt a model similar to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, becoming a major provider of foundry capacity in North America and Europe.\nMoreover, Intel is moving into AI, a market valued at about $200 billion last year and projected to hit nearly $2 trillion by 2030. \nIn December 2023, the company debuted a range of AI chips, including Gaudi 3, a graphics processing unit (GPU) designed to challenge similar offerings from market leader Nvidia. Intel also showed off new Core Ultra processors and Xeon server chips, which include neural processing units for running AI programs more efficiently.\nIntel's forward P/E of 26 makes it one of the best-valued AI chip stocks right now, with Nvidia's at 35 and AMD's even higher at 45. As a result, the company's stock is a lower-risk way to invest in the AI chip industry and an excellent option to hold over the long term. \nApple's stock has a long reputation for providing investors with consistent and significant gains. In fact, Warren Buffett's holdings company, Berkshire Hathaway, has dedicated 43% of its portfolio to Apple. Meanwhile, the iPhone company's shares have soared 571% since Berkshire first invested in 2016.\nApple has made many millionaires in its time, and it's unlikely to stop as the company continues to dominate consumer tech and expand into budding sectors like AI.\nShares in Apple popped 4% on April 11, marking its best performance in almost a year. The rally came after a Bloomberg report revealed the company will overhaul its Mac computer lineup to center around AI capabilities.\nApple dominates consumer tech, with leading market shares in most of its product categories. Immense brand loyalty from consumers could see the company become a major growth driver in the public's adoption of AI, allowing Apple to carve out a lucrative position in the market. As a result, news that future products will place a stronger focus on the generative technology is promising.\nMoreover, despite recent headwinds, Apple achieved $107 billion in free cash flow\u00a0last year, significantly more than rivals like Microsoft, Amazon, or Alphabet. The figure indicates Apple has the financial resources to continue investing in its business and overcome potential headwinds.\nWith significant cash resources, an expanding position in AI, and a comparatively low forward P/E, Apple's stock is worth considering over Nvidia right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a growth machine recently. Revenue and profits are through the roof. The chipmaker has become synonymous with artificial intelligence (AI). Its high-powered chips are in heavy demand to power those AI's computationally intensive systems, and they have become crucial for many companies. The downside for investors may be that the stock has already generated such impressive returns that it may be too late to benefit much from the growth.\nThe stock is up more than 220% over the past year and the company's market cap now tops $2 trillion. Some investors now wonder if they would be better off waiting for a dip in Nvidia's stock price. Or should they add shares now anyway?\nAs expensive as Nvidia's stock is, the sheer potential in AI suggests investors should remain bullish on it as an investment. The technology is still in its early stages, and companies are just beginning to develop AI models. According to a recent forecast from Gartner, the global market for AI chips will soar to $119.4 billion by 2027, which is more than double what it was worth in 2023.\nNvidia, being a dominant player in the industry and a provider of AI chips, stands to benefit from this growth. In the company's most recent fiscal year, which ended Jan. 28, revenue grew by 126% to just under $61 billion, and net income was nearly half of that at around $30 billion.\nAs demand for AI chips grows, it's easy to see a path for Nvidia's earnings to continue growing, making its current valuation less problematic for long-term buy-and-hold investors.\nThe biggest concern with these AI developments is that reality won't align with the hype. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that when it comes to what AI can do, \"people are begging to be disappointed and they will be.\" While it can enhance productivity, the technology's potential, at least in the near term, may have been oversold.\nIn the meantime, investors in many companies are paying for those sky-high expectations. Nvidia's valuation may look relatively reasonable when you look at its price/earnings-to-growth ratio, which is around 1.2, but that still implies a high level of earnings growth over the next five years. If those assumptions prove to be too optimistic, then that could make the AI stock vulnerable to a sell-off.\nPlus, there's always the risk of a recession. While there's talk of a potential soft landing for the U.S. economy, if it performs worse than expected, companies could scale back on their AI-related investments and spending, especially if the gains they are seeing from it aren't immediate or impactful enough.\nNvidia is a leading AI company and it could be a great way to invest in tech. But investors should consider its valuation, and what assumptions they're relying on when they look at its price tag. If you're bullish on AI and believe it will be a game changer for industries and companies around the world, then it's certainly not too late to invest in Nvidia given its dominant presence in the space and the growth opportunities ahead.\nTrying to time the market, however, and waiting for a dip in Nvidia's stock may not be ideal because odds are it's not going to come down significantly unless there's a broader market sell-off related to the economy, which would mean its growth prospects have taken a big hit, in which case the entire investing thesis in the stock may change as well. So as long as you're bullish on AI, Nvidia can still be a good buy right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $5.48, showcasing a 402.75% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $24.17 billion, indicating a 236.08% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $23.84 per share and a revenue of $105.13 billion, demonstrating changes of +83.95% and +72.56%, respectively, from the preceding year.\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Nvidia.

Its revenue rose 13% year over year to $18.9 billion and its earnings grew 5% to $1.38 per American depositary receipt (ADR). Both figures exceeded analysts' expectations.\nHowever, TSMC followed up its earnings beat with a cautious outlook for the industry. It reduced its full-year revenue forecast for the broader semiconductor market (excluding memory chips) from \"more than 10%\" growth to \"approximately 10%\" and cut its outlook for the foundry market from \"approximately 20%\" to \"mid-to-high teens\" growth.\nThose comments immediately caused many semiconductor stocks, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), to tumble. But if we dig a bit deeper, we'll see that TSMC's earnings report actually featured good news for Nvidia, so the AI chipmaker's recent pullback might represent a great buying opportunity for patient investors.\nTSMC reined in its expectations for the semiconductor sector, but it still reiterated its own revenue guidance for \"low to mid-20%\" growth for the full year, which matches analysts' prediction of a 21% boost. TSMC is still bullish on its own prospects because it expects the expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market to offset the persistent weakness of the PC and smartphone markets. In other words, the growth of the AI market will still drive Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and other chipmakers to ramp up their production of high-end data center GPUs at TSMC.\nDuring the first-quarter conference call, CEO C.C. Wei said TSMC was still experiencing a \"surge in AI-related demand\" and predicted its revenue from server AI processors would \"more than double this year\" and account for a \"low-teens\" percentage of its full-year sales. Wei also predicted the AI processor market would continue expanding at a 50% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, account for over a fifth of its top line by 2028, and become the \"largest contributor\" to its overall revenue growth.\nThose all seem like bright green flags for TSMC's top client. Nvidia dominates the booming market with its high-end data center GPUs for processing AI tasks. During Nvidia's last conference call in February, CFO Colette Kress said the demand for its latest data center GPUs \"far exceeds\" its available supply.\nTSMC's outlook is clearly bullish for Nvidia, but three factors seemed to cause Nvidia's stock to drop. First, short-sighted investors were likely looking for any reasons to take profits after Nvidia's massive rally. Even after its recent dip, it remains up more than 170% over the past 12 months and nearly 400% over the past three years.\nSecond, many trading algorithms, ETFs, and institutional investors buy and sell sectors in entire bunches instead of focusing on individual companies. So when a chip bellwether like TSMC delivers imperfect results, it can sink the entire sector.\nFinally, the macro environment remains unpredictable. A hotter-than-expected inflation report for March is dampening hopes for quick interest rate cuts, and the escalating conflict in the Middle East is driving up commodity prices. These challenges could be driving investors away from Nvidia and other higher-growth tech stocks.\nNevertheless, investors who can look past those near-term challenges should consider Nvidia's pullback to be a golden buying opportunity. Back in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS surged 126% and 288%, respectively. That growth was mainly driven by the expansion of its data center business.\nFor fiscal 2025, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS to increase another 82% and 89%, respectively, as the AI market continues to evolve. It obviously can't maintain those hypergrowth rates forever, but TSMC's optimistic five-year outlook for the AI arena suggests it still has plenty of room to run.\nAt $760, Nvidia stock trades for just 31 times this year's adjusted earnings. AMD, which is growing at a slower pace, trades at 44 times forward earnings. That reasonable valuation makes Nvidia a compelling buy for patient investors right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Nvidia (NVDA) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 50%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 84% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -1.6%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 0.6%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.1% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nvidia a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Nvidia is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Holding stocks through the up and down cycles of the stock market is hard for many investors. After all, if a stock doubles or triples, people don't want to see those gains disappear. And it can be gut-wrenching to watch a stock you own seemingly drop day after day.\nBut having the fortitude to hold the stocks of great companies over the long term is the way to let your investments grow and generate what can be life-changing returns. Leading technology company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a case in point.\nBefore looking at where Nvidia might go from here, consider the path the stock has taken over the past five years. The company spent years developing the computing power hardware and related software needed for cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Now that it is monetizing that research and development, investors who held shares along the way have been rewarded handsomely.\nConsider that if you had invested $2,500 in Nvidia just five years ago, those shares would now be worth $44,900. But one had to have a strong stomach to see those gains. Much of that massive return was realized over the last 18 months. \nThe average 78% annual return trounces the approximately 10% total annual return of the S&P 500 index over the past 95 years. But it wasn't an easy road to achieve that return. There were several periods in those five years when Nvidia shares plunged by more than 25% from the previous high. That included a massive 65% plunge that occurred during 2022.\nBut Nvidia's powerful computing chips and software are in high demand now. That's led to an exponential jump in revenue and earnings. No one knows where Nvidia stock will be in 2025. But long-term investors shouldn't worry about that. As long as the company continues to innovate, the stock deserves a place in any diversified portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were climbing again last month as the AI leader continued to benefit from investor excitement for all things artificial intelligence.\nAdditionally, the company got a positive response at its annual developer conference and enjoyed some momentum at the beginning of March from its strong fourth-quarter earnings report in February.\nAccording to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Nvidia stock finished the month up 14%. As you can see from the chart, there wasn't a defining trend for Nvidia last month, though it got a strong start out of the gate.\nNvidia has emerged as the leader of the AI boom, as the company's GPUs (graphics processing chips) and Superchips have been in such high demand that it's been unable to fill it.\nNvidia stock jumped to start March, as it seemed to benefit from a surge in shares of fellow AI winner Super Micro Computer, after that stock, which specializes in AI servers, jumped after being admitted to the S&P 500.\nAI stocks have had a tendency to travel in tandem, as good news for one is often good news for another, and Nvidia and Super Micro Computer are close partners.\nLater in the month, Nvidia unveiled its new Blackwell platform at its developer conference, and CEO Jensen Huang shared his vision for the company and AI in a keynote address. Nvidia said the new platform will allow organizations to run real-time generative AI for programs like large language models at up to 25 times less costs and energy consumption than the Hopper predecessor.\nNvidia also made several other announcements of new products and partnerships that left investors with the impression that the company was well positioned to maintain its lead in AI. Analysts generally weighed in on the conference with price target hikes and favorable commentary.\nFinally, Nvidia stock cooled off in the last week of March on little company-specific news.\nThere's no question that Nvidia is dominating the market for AI hardware, but there are a number of companies racing to try to break Nvidia's grip on the technology, including some of its biggest customers, like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms.\nIf the company can remain the clear leader in AI, the stock is likely to continue advancing, but Nvidia investors should pay attention to the competition as a serious threat could dent Nvidia's fat profit margins.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If you didn't think the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) could get any stronger, think again.\nFour of the biggest tech companies in the world all reported very strong demand for AI applications, and that's great news for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker designs the leading GPUs for training the large language models powering new generative AI applications. It could see a big increase in business based on recent management commentary from Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\nHere's what they had to say and what it all means for Nvidia and its investors.\nTesla plans to unveil its robotaxi in August. The Cybercab relies on Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) capabilities, which use artificial intelligence to make real-time driving decisions.\nTo train that AI, Tesla has rapidly expanded its AI training infrastructure. CEO Elon Musk says the company doubled its training compute power sequentially in the first quarter. What's more, he expects Tesla's cluster of 35,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs to expand to about 85,000 by the year's end, just for training its AI.\nThat's a huge investment coming Nvidia's way. It's also a major endorsement for Nvidia from Musk, who had previously considered other chipmakers' GPUs.\nMeta has been spending heavily to build out data centers to train its artificial intelligence, but now, it sees a good reason to spend even more.\nAlongside its first-quarter earnings release, Meta shared plans to increase its capital expenditures from its original range of $30 billion to $37 billion to somewhere between $35 billion and $40 billion when all is said and done in 2024. And the company expects to spend even more than that in 2025.\nThat's because CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees an opportunity for Meta to \"build leading AI models and be the leading AI company in the world.\"\nMeta has made excellent progress in just a few years developing its LLaMA large language model. It recently released version 3 of the model, rolling out its Meta AI chatbot alongside it. Zuckerberg thinks there are a lot of business opportunities for Meta if it can build an AI model used by hundreds of millions of people around the world.\nBut to get there, it has to spend heavily, and a lot of that spending will go toward Nvidia's chips, at least for the time being. Meta's also building its own custom silicon to train its AI.\nMeta's not the only company that's planning to increase its spending on AI infrastructure. Microsoft also expects a big step up in spending thanks to the growing demand for AI.\n\"Currently, near-term AI demand is a bit higher than our available capacity,\" CFO Amy Hood told analysts during Microsoft's fiscal third-quarter earnings call.\nMicrosoft set itself up as the leading public cloud service provider for AI application developers when it announced a $10 billion investment in OpenAI at the start of 2023. That move has paid off handsomely as the growing demand for AI has led Microsoft to take share from other public cloud competitors. But even as it invests in adding capacity, it seemingly hasn't been able to keep up.\nMicrosoft now plans to increase spending for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and fiscal 2025 in order to meet the growing demand. It's also developing its own AI using OpenAI's GPT model, which powers its Copilot software.\nAgain, a lot of the step up in spending will go toward buying more Nvidia chips for its cloud customers' needs. Microsoft, however, does design its own chips as well.\nThere were many market-pleasing surprises in Alphabet's first-quarter earnings report, but one should stand out to Nvidia's investors.\nAlphabet poured $12 billion into capital expenditures last quarter. That's nearly double what it spent during the year-ago period.\nAlphabet's investments will primarily go toward adding capacity to Google Cloud and building and training more advanced AI models. Alphabet is also integrating AI into search -- it recently rolled out AI-powered answers at the top of certain search queries.\nIt's worth noting Alphabet uses its own chip designs to train its Gemini model, but it will still commit some spending to Nvidia as its cloud customers demand those chips.\nWe're currently in the midst of an AI arms race. As Microsoft pointed out, the demand for AI compute is bigger than the supply.\nThat's been an incredible boon for Nvidia, which can't produce chips fast enough to supply everyone who wants them. As a result, its pricing power has gone through the roof. Its gross margin climbed from 56.9% in fiscal 2023 to 72.7% in fiscal 2024. The comments from its fellow Magnificent Seven companies suggest demand continues to outpace supply, which bodes well for Nvidia going forward.\nEven after an incredible run over the last couple of years, Nvidia could still benefit from the increased spending from big tech over the next two years. However, a lot of that spending is going toward developing and deploying those companies' own chip designs. Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta all design their own AI training and inference chips. Apple is reportedly working on its own AI data center chips as well.\nAs these big companies shift more of their AI workload to their own chip designs, it'll take a huge bite out of Nvidia's demand. And despite strong demand trends from smaller enterprises without in-house designs, it's hard to overcome that challenge.\nTo be sure, the next few years will likely be very good for Nvidia, but its position at the top of the AI food chain is rather precarious. With shares trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 35 as of this writing, investors are expecting very high sustained earnings growth for years to come. I'm not sold that Nvidia has the competitive moat to make that happen, even if the near-term demand appears extremely promising.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang\nSEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's SK Hynix Inc said it expected a full recovery in memory chips on AI demand, posting its highest profit in nearly two years on sales of advanced DRAM chips with high bandwidth memory (HBM) for use in generative AI chipsets.\nThe world's second-biggest memory chipmaker reported a 2.89 trillion won ($2.1 billion) operating profit for the March quarter versus a loss of 3.4 trillion won a year earlier, beating a 1.88 trillion won projection by LSEG SmartEstimate weighted towards analysts that are more consistently accurate.\n\"The memory market is entering into full recovery cycle with ongoing strength of AI demand,\" SK Hynix said.\nWith chipmakers focusing production capacity more on chips to meet AI-driven demand, there may be a shortage of regular memory chips for smartphones, personal computers and network servers by year-end if demand for tech devices exceeds expectations, Hynix said.\nThursday's result marks Hynix's second-highest profit for the January-March quarter ever, a quick turnaround from heavy losses incurred in the year through the third quarter of 2023 as the global memory chip sector went through its worst downturn in decades, hit by a slump in demand for tech devices post-COVID.\nAI BOOM\nAmong memory chipmakers, SK Hynix is the biggest beneficiary of the explosive increase in AI adoption, as it became the main supplier of HBM chips for Nvidia's graphic processing units that train AI systems.\nSK Hynix has been the sole supplier of HBM3 to Nvidia, which has 80% of the market for AI chips, and began mass production of the latest version of HBM chips, called HBM3E, with shipments going to the U.S. firm.\nRival Micron, however, also said its HBM chips were sold out for 2024 and a majority of its 2025 supply was already allocated, and industry No.1 Samsung Electronics plans to ship its latest and most powerful HBM chips in the third quarter.\n\"Competition in HBM will intensify, sales prices will fall, and SK Hynix's market share will likely fall from the second half of this year,\" said Pak Yuak, analyst at Kiwoom Securities.\nTo stay ahead, SK Hynix announced this month a $3.87 billion investment to build an advanced chip packaging plant in Indiana with an HBM chip line, and a 5.3 trillion won investment to build a new South Korean DRAM chip factory with focus on HBMs.\nIt will collaborate with TSMC to develop the next version of HBM chips, called HBM4, as well as chip packaging that can produce custom HBM chips.\nIts NAND flash chip business swung to profit in the first quarter, as demand for enterprise solid-state drives (eSSDs) spiked from on-premises AI data centres wanting storage drives that can handle heavy workloads and consume less power.\nSK Hynix said its plant in Dalian, China, is producing 144-layer and 192-layer NAND flash chips that will respond to this new AI-driven demand.\n($1 = 1,374.6200 won)\n(Reporting by Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang; Editing by Kim Coghill, Sonali Paul and Tom Hogue)\n"

        "Title": "These 4 Measures Indicate That NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Is Using Debt Safely",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt in January 2024, down from US$11.0b, one year before. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$26.0b in cash, so it actually has US$16.3b net cash.\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$10.6b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$12.1b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$26.0b and US$10.00b worth of receivables due within a year. So it can boast US$13.2b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nThis state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the US$2.22t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\nEven more impressive was the fact that NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 489% over twelve months. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if NVIDIA can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 80% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that NVIDIA has net cash of US$16.3b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$27b, being 80% of its EBIT. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for NVIDIA that you should be aware of before investing here.\nIf you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the hottest themes pushing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to new heights is artificial intelligence (AI). Applications from ChatGPT and competing platforms have taken the world by storm, and the momentum doesn't appear to be slowing down.\nLike all emerging growth trends, there are loads of opportunities to invest in artificial intelligence (AI). One of the bigger areas in the AI realm is data centers.\nWhile Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel and other leading chip companies fuel demand for data center services, there's another opportunity that's caught my attention. Vertiv Holdings (NYSE: VRT) is an emerging player developing infrastructure for data centers. Let's dive into how Vertiv is benefiting from the AI boom and assess if now is a good opportunity to scoop up some shares.\nAccording to Statista, the total addressable market for data centers will be $438 billion by 2028. This forecast includes several aspects related to data centers, including IT architecture solutions such as storage clusters and server racks, as well as network infrastructure.\nOne of the biggest factors impacting data centers right now is how much energy these facilities consume. Vertiv is unique because it specializes in heat collection and liquid cooling for both indoors on server racks and outside of data center complexes.\nThe table illustrates Vertiv's operating performance in 2023.\nCategory\n2023\n2022\n% Change\nRevenue\n$6.9 billion\n$5.7 billion\n21%\nFree cash flow\n$778 million\n($260 million)\nN/A\nData Source: Vertiv investor relations. Table by author.\nBreaking down Vertiv's revenue growth into a bit more detail, investors will see that the company is firing on all cylinders.\nFor the year ended Dec. 31, Vertiv increased sales in critical infrastructure and solutions by 28%, integrated rack solutions by 12%, and other services by 7.5%. The company's acceleration in infrastructure service and rack solutions are particularly encouraging.\nMoreover, Vertiv ended the fourth quarter with 23% growth in its backlog -- which reached a record $5.5 billion.\nAbout a month ago, Vertiv released some interesting news to investors: The company was selected to join Nvidia's partner network. Vertiv joins other data center solutions providers working with Nvidia to \"offer its expertise in addressing the unique infrastructure challenges presented by accelerated computing.\"\nWhile this is not a reason to buy Vertiv stock, I see the partnership as a unique source of future lead generation. Considering Nvidia's data center business grew 217% year over year in 2023, I think Vertiv's relationship with the chipmaker could prove to be lucrative in the long run as the secular AI narrative continues to evolve.\nAll this said, one important item to point out with Vertiv is its valuation. Excitement around AI has undoubtedly pushed the capital markets to new highs over the last year. While big tech has been the primary beneficiary, broader momentum has reached tangential players.\nShares of Vertiv have rocketed 545% over the last year, and as a result the stock has become a bit pricey. Vertiv's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35 is well above that of the S&P 500, which boasts a forward P/E of about 21.\nNevertheless, I still see Vertiv as a good opportunity right now. When it comes to investing in AI, I think opportunities in data centers are still generally treading under the radar.\nThe combination of strong top-line growth plus a robust pipeline of new business yet to be recognized makes Vertiv a compelling opportunity in the red-hot data center space.\nBefore you buy stock in Vertiv, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vertiv wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the standard bearer for the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and the potential for significant productivity increases resulting from the widespread adoption of the technology. The company's state-of-the-art processors have essentially cornered the market for AI applications. However, Nvidia is seeing increasing competition, which is weighing on the stock in recent weeks.\nOne Wall Street analyst believes this represents a buying opportunity.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore raised his price target on Nvidia to $1,000 while maintaining an overweight (buy) rating. That represents potential gains of 17% compared to Tuesday's closing price. The analyst notes that Nvidia stock is down about 10% from its peak, giving investors a compelling opportunity to buy shares.\nMoore goes even further, suggesting that owning Nvidia stock is the \"best way\" to capitalize on the shift to generative AI, as investments in the technology are only beginning to ramp up.\nI'm completely on board with this logic. Data centers are in the midst of a massive upgrade cycle to handle the computational horsepower needed to run AI workloads. Furthermore, the construction of new data centers is booming. One example is the $100 billion data center project planned by Microsoft and OpenAI dubbed \"Stargate.\"\nCEO Jensen Huang estimates there will be $2 trillion in data center spending over the coming four to five years. With a 95% share of the GPU data center market, this will result in continuing strong demand for Nvidia's processors.\nNvidia stock currently sells for 73 times trailing 12-month earnings. Analysts' consensus estimates are calling for earnings per share (EPS) of $24.48 in 2025 and $30.63 by 2026. If the analyst's price target is on track, that would shrink Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 41 next year and 33 the year after, which illustrates why Nvidia stock is still a bargain.\nFor those reasons and more, Nvidia stock is a buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Most readers would already be aware that NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock increased significantly by 56% over the past three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study NVIDIA's  ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:\n69% = US$30b \u00f7 US$43b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2024).\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.69 in profit.\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\nFirst thing first, we like that NVIDIA has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 14% which is quite remarkable. As a result, NVIDIA's exceptional 39% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that NVIDIA's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 29% in the same period, which is great to see.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if NVIDIA is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\nNVIDIA's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 5.2%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 95% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 0.5% over the next three years. However, NVIDIA's future ROE is expected to decline to 53% despite the expected decline in its payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be steering the foreseen decline in the company's ROE.\nIn total, we are pretty happy with NVIDIA's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: This \"Fab Four\" Stock Is a Bargain Buy Right Now",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Last year, everyone talked about the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a group of technology industry leaders that drove gains in the S&P 500. A few of those stocks recently have faltered, and now, the focus is on the \"Fab Four\" -- the four members of the Magnificent Seven that continue to roar higher. These market winners are Nvidia, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Amazon, and Microsoft.\nNvidia is the biggest gainer of them all, climbing 80% so far this year, and still represents a great stock to buy. But a better bargain exists among these Fab Four stocks. This particular player offers you a solid earnings track record, a strong moat, exposure to the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI), and promising long-term prospects. So forget Nvidia... this Fab Four stock is the one to scoop up right now.\nI'm talking about Meta, a company almost everyone is familiar with, thanks to its family of popular social media apps including Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. More than 3.1 billion people use at least one of Meta's apps every day -- so it's no surprise advertisers flock to the platform to connect with these potential customers.\nAdvertising makes up the lion's share of Meta's revenue -- more than 95% of the total of $134 billion last year. And thanks to the company's strong moat (or competitive advantage), this is unlikely to change. It's difficult to switch to another social media platform knowing that all your contacts may not be there. This keeps fans loyal, and Meta's work to make its platforms more dynamic, fun, and practical could reinforce this loyalty.\nThis brings me to the company's investment in AI -- an area Meta says will be its biggest investment theme this year. The company already has brought Meta AI, an advanced conversational assistant, to its family of apps, but it isn't stopping there. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg says he wants to roll out AI across Meta's products and services so that all Meta users can rely on AI to accomplish their goals -- from leisure to business.\nThat's why Meta is ramping up its computer power and aims to bring on board 600,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) by the end of the year. GPUs power AI models and platforms. For example, they drive the training and inference of large language models (LLMs) so that these tools can successfully solve complex problems.\nMeta's developed its own LLM called Llama, and now Llama 3 is in training. Llama is the technology behind Meta AI and other AI products at Meta, but the company isn't keeping it all to itself. By making it open source -- or open to general use -- Meta gains valuable feedback to improve its technology and gains many users -- putting its software on the path to becoming an industry standard.\nDown the road, Meta likely will continue to be a social media giant and, along with that, could also become an AI leader. Meanwhile, the company's financial position should allow it to invest in the technology needed to reach these goals. Meta made moves last year in what Zuckerberg calls the \"year of efficiency\" to get there, and in the latest quarterly report, Meta announced its first-ever dividend, showing its confidence that it has what it takes to fund growth and reward shareholders.\nHow much do you have to pay to get access to such a player? Not as much as you might think. Today, Meta is trading for only 24x forward earnings estimates, making it the cheapest of the Fab Four by this measure.\nAs I mentioned above, Nvidia still has plenty of growth ahead but its stock isn't the only game in town. Today, Meta is cheaper and offers you the potential of a winning AI story, along with the solidity of a highly profitable social media business. That means right now, I'd forget Nvidia and buy shares of this Fab Four bargain instead.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has witnessed a remarkable run, showcasing a staggering 82.5% surge in its stock price in the first quarter of 2024, pushing the company to the forefront of technology and innovation. NVIDIA also achieved a massive milestone in March 2024 by joining the exclusive club of companies with more than $2 trillion market capitalization.\nThe surge reflects investors' confidence in NVIDIA's strategic positioning, robust financial performance and pivotal role in shaping transformative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), gaming and data center solutions.\nHowever, the looming question remains \u2014 Can NVIDIA sustain this momentum in the quarters ahead?\nNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\nNVIDIA\u2019s robust stock price performance has been primarily driven by hopes that the company will be a prime beneficiary of growing investments in generative AI. Given generative AI\u2019s inherited opportunities and the company\u2019s leadership in the space, we believe the NVDA stock is poised to carry the momentum in 2024.\nNVIDIA dominates the market for AI chips. The meteoric rise of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and its adoption among enterprises have already proven generative AI technology\u2019s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.\nThe growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 39.6% from 2024 to 2030.\nHowever, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\nNVIDIA\u2019s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. The company\u2019s GPUs are already being applied in AI models. This is expanding NVDA\u2019s footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\nThe generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. Considering surging AI investments across the data center end market, NVDA expects its first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues to reach $24 billion from $7.19 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Growth Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nSome other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector include Meta Platforms META, Zscaler ZS and Twilio TWLO.\nMeta Platforms currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s 2024 earnings has been revised 13% upward to $19.94 per share in the past 60 days, which suggests year-over-year growth of 91.6%. The long-term estimated earnings growth rate for the stock stands at 19.5%.\nZscaler carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s fiscal 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 26 cents to $4.03 per share in the past 30 days, which calls for an increase of 52.5% on a year-over-year basis. The long-term expected earnings growth rate for the stock is pegged at 28.1%.\nTwilio carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. The consensus mark for Twilio\u2019s 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 6 cents to $2.70 per share over the past seven days, which indicates a 10.2% increase from 2023.

        "Title": "Could Super Micro Computer Become the Next Nvidia?",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) have turned out to be superb investments over the past year thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled demand for their products, which has led to a sharp jump in their revenue and earnings.\nWhile shares of Nvidia have gained more than 234% in the past year, Super Micro Computer stock has delivered an even more stunning gain of 855%. Both companies are capitalizing on the booming demand for AI servers although in different ways. Nvidia dominates the market for AI GPUs (graphics processing units) with an estimated share of more than 95%.\nSuper Micro Computer, on the other hand, makes modular server solutions that are used for mounting AI chips from the likes of Nvidia and other prominent chipmakers. One might argue that Super Micro and Nvidia aren't exactly comparable, but investors should note that both companies are riding on the same catalyst.\nMoreover, Super Micro has turned out to be the go-to supplier of AI server solutions for data center operators and cloud computing providers. But can it become a dominant force in AI servers like Nvidia is dominating the market for AI chips? Let's find out.\nIn the trailing 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2023, Super Micro generated revenue of $9.25 billion. Management pointed out on the January earnings conference call that it gets more than half of its top line from selling server solutions related to AI GPUs. So selling AI server solutions represented at least $4.6 billion in revenue. Based on Foxconn's estimate that the AI server market was worth $30 billion last year, it can be assumed that Super Micro controlled just over 15% of this market.\nFoxconn predicts that the AI server market could generate $150 billion in revenue in 2027. That would translate into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 49%. It is worth noting that Super Micro's revenue is growing at a much faster pace than the estimated growth of the AI server market. Its fiscal Q2 revenue more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to $3.66 billion.\nFor the full fiscal year, Super Micro is estimating revenue of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion. The midpoint of that range suggests that the company's revenue will more than double from fiscal 2023's figure of $7.1 billion. So Super Micro seems on track to corner a bigger share of the AI server market.\nMeanwhile, Super Micro has been laser-focused on enhancing its production capacity so that it can meet the fast-growing AI server demand. The company points out that its production expansion moves now allow it to support an annual revenue capacity of $25 billion.\nThat figure looks set to move higher since the company recently decided to raise additional capital through a common stock offering. Though the move would dilute existing shareholders, Super Micro's plan to use that money to enhance its manufacturing capacity would allow it to corner a bigger share of the AI server market.\nNot surprisingly, the stock was upgraded by multiple Wall Street firms recently, which believe that its market share gains are here to stay.\u00a0Analysts are expecting Super Micro's earnings to increase at an impressive pace over the next five years, outpacing the growth that Nvidia is predicted to deliver.\nConsensus estimates suggest that Super Micro's earnings could increase at a 48% CAGR over the next five years. That's higher than the 38% annual earnings growth that Nvidia is expected to deliver over the same period. Moreover, Super Micro stock has already been delivering much stronger gains when compared to Nvidia. Even then, the stock remains attractively valued.\nSuper Micro and Nvidia are not very far from each other when it comes to their earnings multiples, be it trailing or forward. This can be seen in the chart below.\nWhat's more, Super Micro's sales multiple of 5.6 is significantly cheaper than Nvidia's reading of nearly 37. So if the market decides to reward Super Micro Computer with a higher price-to-sales ratio thanks to the eye-popping growth that it has been delivering, it could continue to outperform Nvidia on the market in the future as well.\nThat's why investors who have missed Super Micro's surge so far can still consider buying this stock, as its market share gains in AI servers point toward more stock price upside.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.20 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 40 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.5% and 5% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Nvidia, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs NVDA a Good Investment?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.7% over the past month to $23.84.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nvidia.

        "Text": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n View our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Which is why EPS growth is looked upon so favourably. It is awe-striking that NVIDIA's EPS went from US$1.76 to US$12.09 in just one year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that NVIDIA is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 33.4 percentage points to 54%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\nWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for NVIDIA?\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$1.9t company like NVIDIA. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$74b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.\nNVIDIA's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching NVIDIA very closely. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for NVIDIA  that you should be aware of.\nAlthough NVIDIA certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with insider buying, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have also seen recent insider buying..\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Can Taiwan Semiconductor Stock (NYSE:TSM) Replicate Nvidia\u2019s Performance?",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), the world\u2019s largest chipmaker, recently posted impressive revenue figures for March. Notably, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has gained 242.5% in the past year, relies on TSM for chip manufacturing. However, TSM\u2019s stock performance (up 71.5% over the same period; see the comparison image below) has been relatively subdued. This begs the question: can TSM replicate NVDA\u2019s stellar performance? The answer is likely a \u201cyes.\u201d\nWith the ongoing AI boom, increased funding from the U.S., and an attractive valuation, TSM looks like a compelling buy right now.\nOn April 10, TSM unveiled impressive revenue figures for March, marking the highest month-over-month growth since November 2022 at 34.3% year-over-year, totaling 195.2 billion New Taiwan dollars (approximately $6.1 billion). Additionally, Q1 revenues are projected to increase by 16.5% year-over-year, reaching 592.6 billion New Taiwan dollars (around $18.4 billion).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that TSM anticipates mid-20% revenue growth for FY 2024, fueled by strong demand for its latest nano chips amid the AI surge. Moreover, the company reaffirmed in January 2024 that its AI revenues are growing rapidly at approximately 50% annually. This reaffirmation is particularly reassuring following the revenue decline reported in 2023.\nTSM manufactures the chips and supplies them to tech titans like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Ahead of its Q1 earnings release expected on April 18, let\u2019s take a look at what the future holds for TSM.\nThe AI revolution has taken the world by storm. I firmly believe that its growth trajectory is enduring. The AI industry, still in its infancy, is projected to witness remarkable expansion across diverse industries and applications. According to\u00a0Next Move Strategy Consulting, the industry is anticipated to burgeon into a $1.85 trillion behemoth by 2030, compared to around $208 billion in 2023.\nTSM\u2019s customers heavily rely on the company for the production of chips they design. An uproar in demand for everything AI has led to a huge demand for AI chips.\nTo add to the AI growth spurt, TSM got yet another boost to its manufacturing operations, as it received approval for direct federal funding worth $11.6 billion under the U.S. government\u2019s CHIPS Act. The company will receive $6.6 billion in grants to expand its manufacturing facility in Phoenix, Arizona. In addition, TSM is eligible for an incremental loan of $5 billion.\nTSM has already invested in building two plants at the site and will use the funding to build an additional factory. The firm\u2019s total investment across all three factories is estimated at $65 billion. This marks the \u201clargest foreign direct investments in a greenfield project in U.S. history,\u201d according to the press release.\nTSM plans to produce 2-nanometer technology chips at the second factory starting in 2028. In the coming years, TSM should reap the benefits of massive investments that will greatly enhance its manufacturing operations and bring in the latest technological advancements.\nSharing his optimism, TSM Chairman Mark Liu stated, \u201cOur U.S. operations allow us to better support our U.S. customers, which include several of the world\u2019s leading technology companies. Our U.S. operations will also expand our capability to trailblaze future advancements in semiconductor technology.\u201d\nTo date, the majority of TSM\u2019s manufacturing capabilities are based in Taiwan, which poses a geographical risk (potential threat of Chinese invasion, earthquakes, etc.). With the latest expansion announcement, that risk will be alleviated. With increased manufacturing in the U.S., TSM will likely more efficiently cater to its top-notch clients like Nvidia, AMD, and Apple based in the U.S. On top of that, record-high crypto prices are creating higher demand for chips, adding to TSM\u2019s growth outlook.\nIn terms of its valuation, TSM looks cheap. Currently, it\u2019s trading at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 23x compared to much higher multiples of its peer group. Semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices is trading at a higher forward P/E multiple (49x), while the AI prodigy Nvidia is trading at a forward P/E of 36.4x.\nWall Street analysts expect TSM\u2019s EPS to reach $9.02 in FY 2026. If TSM keeps the same forward P/E multiple by then, its share price will be about $207, 45% higher than the current price. Therefore, it makes sense to consider buying TSM stock at current levels, given the strong growth potential in the AI space.\nThe Wall Street community is clearly optimistic about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing stock. Overall, the stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on eight unanimous Buys. TSM stock\u2019s average price target of $154.14 implies 8.2% upside potential from current levels.\nThe semiconductor industry is experiencing a significant surge, largely driven by the AI boom. TSM, along with its AI-focused counterparts, stands to gain from this relentless demand. With strategic investments and expansion plans in place to meet future demands, TSM appears well-positioned for sustained growth. Considering these factors, I am inclined to buy the stock at its current levels, anticipating long-term benefits from its AI potential.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the top ways to play the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, as customers line up to buy its powerful graphics cards so that they don't miss out on the fast-growing adoption of this technology that's expected to give the global economy a huge boost.\nAccording to PwC, AI could add a whopping $15.7 trillion to global GDP (gross domestic product) by 2030. Nvidia will play a central role in driving this AI-related economic growth thanks to its graphics processing units (GPUs), which play a major role in training large language models (LLMs) and developing AI applications.\nAll this explains why Nvidia has been growing at a breathtaking pace, leading to an impressive surge in its stock price.\nHowever, Nvidia's rally wouldn't have been possible without its foundry partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC. That's because Nvidia is a fabless semiconductor company, which means that it only designs its chips but leaves the manufacturing part to foundries such as TSMC.\nSo investors looking for an Nvidia proxy to play the AI boom would do well to buy shares of TSMC, as it looks set to join the trillion-dollar market cap club thanks to the impressive upside it is likely to deliver. Let's see why that may be the case.\nTSMC has been rapidly expanding its manufacturing capacity to help Nvidia meet the terrific demand for its AI chips. The company has allocated an estimated 40% to 50% of its advanced chip packaging capacity to Nvidia so that the latter can increase its AI chip supply, according to market research firm TrendForce.\nMore importantly, TSMC is reportedly going to increase its advanced chip packaging -- formally known as a chip on wafer and wafer on substrate (CoWoS) -- capacity to 240,000 units this year from 120,000 units last year. By the end of the year, TSMC is expected to ramp up its monthly CoWoS packaging capacity to 26,000 to 28,000 wafers a month, suggesting that Nvidia could continue to improve the output of its AI chips.\nWhat's more, TSMC has now received a $6.6 billion grant from the U.S. government, along with a $5 billion loan facility, so that it can build more factories in Arizona. TSMC is already building two facilities in Arizona that will go online in 2025 and 2028, and it is now going to build a third site following the latest grant. In all, TSMC is set to spend $65 billion on the three U.S. plants.\nThe third plant will be set up for manufacturing advanced 2-nanometer (nm) chips, which will be deployed for AI and military applications. It is worth noting that TSMC is expected to begin the trial production of 2nm chips for Nvidia so that it can start mass-producing these chips in 2025.\nThe move to a 2nm process is likely to play an important role in helping Nvidia maintain its dominance in the AI chip market. For instance, by moving from a custom 5nm architecture for its Hopper AI GPUs to a custom 4nm process from TSMC for its upcoming Blackwell GPUs, Nvidia is claiming that it can deliver a 7x to 30x jump over its current flagship H100 processor, while also reducing power consumption by up to 25 times.\nSo TSMC looks all set to benefit from Nvidia's AI chip dominance, and this should ideally help drive stronger growth in the company's revenue and earnings. That's probably the reason why analysts have significantly bumped their earnings growth expectations for TSMC.\nTSMC stock trades at 28 times trailing earnings and 23 times forward earnings. Both multiples are lower than the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 30 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). We saw in the chart in the previous section that TSMC's bottom line could jump just over $9 per share in 2026.\nAssuming TSMC does hit that mark and trades at 30 times earnings after three years, in line with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple, its stock price could hit $270 -- an 86% jump from current levels. TSMC currently commands a market cap of $750 billion, which means that it is well on course to join the trillion-dollar market cap club within the next three years.\nAll this indicates why investors looking for an AI stock trading at an attractive valuation should consider buying TSMC hand over fist, as it seems built for terrific upside that could help take its market cap well beyond $1 trillion.\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have rocketed 76% year to date, but the demand for the company's data center chips could still support new highs, according to analysts at KeyBanc.\nAfter digging into Nvidia's supply chain, the firm sees evidence of strong demand for Nvidia's GB200 super chip designed for artificial intelligence (AI). KeyBanc maintained an overweight (buy) rating on the shares but raised the price target from $1,100 to $1,200, representing an upside of nearly 38% over the next 12 months or so from the current share price of around $871.\nAfter a year of 200%-plus revenue growth, Nvidia's data center business is now over three-quarters of the company's revenue. The company won't maintain that level of growth forever, but Wall Street expects revenue to remain robust over the next few years.\nNvidia has a strong pipeline of new technologies coming out to drive more demand for its industry-leading chips. KeyBanc's analysts believe demand for Nvidia's GB200 rack computing systems, which bring together the company's Grace CPUs and Blackwell GPUs, will be in high demand and could command average selling prices between $1.5 million to $2 million.\nAll up, Nvidia's GB200 could generate between $90 billion to $140 billion in annual revenue. This seems to line up with the consensus estimates that call for Nvidia's total revenue to reach $160 billion by calendar 2026.\nBarring anything that could derail the broader recovery in the semiconductor industry, Nvidia stock should hold up and could very well hit the analyst's price target within the next year or so.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "There's no getting around it: Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the tech world by storm, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been leading the charge. In recent weeks, however, the stock has stalled, with some investors fearing the worst.\nOne Wall Street analyst believes the stock is merely gathering stream for its next leg higher.\nEvercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne initiated coverage on Nvidia stock with an outperform (buy) rating while assigning a $1,160 price target on the stock. That represents a potential upside for investors of 35%, compared to Monday's closing price. The analyst stresses Nvidia isn't just a chip company but also supplies hardware and software stacks that rivals simply can't match.\nThe analyst has a point. Nvidia has gone far beyond merely providing the chips that run AI. The company has developed processors, software, accelerators, links, and entire plug-and-play systems that take businesses from zero to 60 with the turn of a key.\nMaterne points out that every 15 to 20 years, a new \"computing era\" emerges, which is \"typically dominated by a single vertically integrated ecosystem company, whose returns are measured in 100- to 1000-bagger range.\" In this scenario, Nvidia is that company.\nWhile 2023 was a breakout year for generative AI, and early adopters jumped on the bandwagon, it's still very early in the game, and most businesses have yet to adopt this groundbreaking technology. A recent survey of 300 business leaders found that just 9% were significantly using AI, with many more expected to deploy it in the coming years.\nRecent research suggests that it could take a decade or more for the adoption of generative AI to peak. Nvidia has positioned itself as the technological leader, suggesting there's much more to come.\nEven after a full fiscal year of more than 100% growth, Nvidia's management suggests there's more to come. While 36x forward earnings might seem pricey, it's attractive when viewed through the lens of the company's ongoing opportunity.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Here's My Favorite Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock, and It's Not Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has skyrocketed over the last year, attracting businesses and consumers from dozens of industries. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reinvigorated the AI market and forced the public to rethink what was currently possible with the generative technology.\nIn the last 12 months, the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index has risen 55%, with much of that growth owed to Nvidia. The chipmaker's business exploded alongside a boom in AI. Its stock has climbed 234% since last April as AI chip demand has increased, leading to soaring earnings for the company.\nAs a result, Nvidia has become a poster child of sorts for the rally in AI. However, with numerous companies joining the market, there are potentially better investment options and ways to back the budding industry.\nSo, here's why Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is my favorite AI stock right now, even over Nvidia.\nAlphabet is no stranger to AI, with CEO Sundar Pichai describing the company as seven years into its \"journey as an AI-first company.\" However, like many tech firms, Alphabet recently placed a stronger focus on the industry.\nSince last year, the company launched its most powerful AI model, Gemini, introduced a range of new AI tools on its cloud platform, Google Cloud, and began incorporating the technology into services across its product lineup.\nAlphabet posted its first quarter of 2024 earnings on April 25, leading its shares to jump 14% in the hours following. The company welcomed revenue gains of 15% year over year, outperforming estimates by nearly $2 billion.\nAlphabet's quarter beat on multiple fronts, with earnings per share hitting $1.89 against expectations of $1.51. Meanwhile, YouTube advertising revenue came in at more than $8 billion when analysts projected $7.7 billion.\nHowever, the most promising beat came from Alphabet's AI-focused Google Cloud segment, which posted revenue growth of 28% year over year to $9.6 billion. Wall Street had forecast $9.3 billion for Alphabet's cloud business.\nInvestors rallied over Alphabet's stock, with signs that the company is beginning to see a return on its investment in AI. Businesses worldwide are increasingly utilizing the Google company's generative AI tools and cloud infrastructure to boost efficiency in their operations.\nMoreover, Alphabet has multiple use cases of AI thanks to the vast user base it has built up with platforms like YouTube, Chrome, Android, and the many services under Google. The company likely has a bright future in AI, and you won't want to miss out.\nIn addition to excitement over its outlook in AI, Alphabet rallied investors this week with the surprise announcement of its first-ever dividend. The cash amount will be $0.20 per share, revealed alongside plans to repurchase up to an additional $70 billion in stock.\nThe dividend represents a vote of confidence from Alphabet's board of directors about the company's direction and financial future. Management clearly believes in the company's path and ability to continue paying dividends for the foreseeable future.\nMoreover, Alphabet's stock is one of the best bargains in AI. The charts above show that it has the lowest forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow out of some of the biggest names in the industry.\nForward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its estimated earnings per share, while price-to-free cash flow divides its market cap by its free cash flow.

        "Title": "7 Strong Chip Stocks to Buy Not Named Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Alex Sirois ",
        "Text": "Mention potential chip stocks to invest in and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is likely the first name that springs to mind. That\u2019s for good reason: Nvidia is a dominant force in artificial intelligence and its chips are in high demand. It also seems you can\u2019t read a headline about the stock market that isn\u2019t somehow connected to the company. However, there are plenty of other strong chip stocks to buy not named Nvidia.\nSome of those stocks represent firms that are vital suppliers to Nvidia and other chip manufacturers. Others represent firms in direct competition. Still, others represent a mix of suppliers and competition.\nWhatever the case, there are many strong choices for chip stocks for investors to consider.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is one of the most important semiconductor companies in the world, if not the most important companies overall. Its stock is the largest foundry globally and a vital link in the supply chain.\nMany semiconductor firms rely on a business model known as fabless manufacturing. Such firms design their hardware and chips, manufactured by foundries, Taiwan Semiconductor being the largest.\nTaiwan Semiconductor makes roughly 90% of the world\u2019s advanced chips. It is responsible for the cutting-edge, advanced AI chips that firms, including Nvidia, make.\nThe company made a bullish call on chip manufacturing demand early this year, forecasting 20% revenue growth. That call immediately spiked shares by more than 10%, and they have since risen by an additional 30%.\nTaiwan Semiconductor doesn\u2019t command the impressive multiples that Nvidia does, but analysts believe it can continue growing at its present price.\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) suffered more than almost any other chip stock throughout the past few years. Pandemic chip shortages hit the specialized memory chip manufacturers particularly hard. Firms over-ordered Micron chips, a supply glut caused demand for those chips to crater, and the company suffered huge operating losses in 2023.\nMicron generated operating losses for the first time in over a decade in 2023. Then, suddenly, the fortunes of the company changed.\nThe company\u2019s specialized high bandwidth memory (HBM) is in high demand. It has applications for the artificial intelligence chips that firms demand. It also began producing HBM, which will be used in Nvidia\u2019s H200 chips.\nThe company\u2019s HBM products remain in high demand. Most of its 2025 capacity is already booked. HBM allows artificial intelligence chips to perform better, so investors should keep their eye on MU shares. Demand is sky-high, which can still push share prices higher.\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is among the very best positioned chip stocks available to investors today. It is, of course, the primary challenger of Nvidia\u2019s dominance. It has emerged as such a potent competitor because Its chips are nearly as powerful as those from Nvidia yet cost a fraction of the price.\nThus, AMD represents the best bang for your buck in the AI chip landscape. Are enterprises willing to risk investing in AMD chips over Nvidia\u2019s? Leading chip purchasers, including Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI have each announced plans to use AMD\u2019s MI300X AI platform.\nHowever, the answer is not that simple. AMD\u2019s newest platform boasts better specifications than Nvidia\u2019s H100 platform. Nvidia is releasing its H200 platform soon. Comparison is, therefore, muddled. Further, Nvidia has stronger software, which is particularly important in AI applications.\nOverall, AMD has a chance to compete with Nvidia, although it is not a clear-cut case. It\u2019s why investors should continue to bet on AMD.\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is another integral link in the advanced chip manufacturing supply chain. The company monopolizes advanced lithography machines used to make the most advanced chips. Essentially, no other firm can replicate the products it produces, giving it a near monopoly.\nA lot has been said about those extreme ultraviolet lithography machines it produces and their importance overall. While that is integral to its story, let\u2019s look at another less covered factor.\nASML has been identified as one of 18 European equivalents to the U.S. Magnificent 7 stocks. UBS (NYSE:UBS) handpicked the Dutch company as one with the potential to outperform significantly. It should be a relatively easy choice for American investors, given that ASML is a tech firm. It is, therefore, very similar to the Magnificent 7, which relies heavily on technology.\nAI demand is going to continue to grow. That means ASML\u2019s EUV machines will continue to be in high demand as the cutting edge fabrication machines that they are.\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock has performed well this year, rising from $140 to $175. That strong performance is paradoxical because the company\u2019s fortunes are generally tied to phone sales.\nDemand for expensive handsets is lagging currently. Consumers continue to feel the pinch of inflation and are more hesitant to purchase phones that can easily cost north of $1,000. Qualcomm is a major supplier of cell phone chips, and thus, should struggle.\nHowever, Qualcomm is not. Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon Gen 8 and Snapdragon Gen 8S chips drive the generative AI on the phone market. The company is iterating its generative AI features down throughout the price range of cell phones. Those chips were first applicable to high-end models and, in time, will bring generative AI capability to lower and lower-range models. It is easy, then, to see why QCOM stock makes so much sense at this time: People spend increasingly more time on their phones and AI opportunities therein are massive.\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), like Qualcomm, is a reliable stock choice for chip stocks investors. Both firms include dividends that signal overall reliability. That isn\u2019t the primary reason for considering investing in Broadcom, but I wanted to mention it.\nThe bigger and more important reason is that Broadcom is an integral chip firm and part of the overall AI opportunity. The company develops infrastructure software solutions for semiconductors. Basically, Broadcom helps chip firms derive greater AI output from the same quantity of power.\nThe company is also thriving fundamentally. During the most recent quarter, revenues increased by 34%, reaching $11.96 billion. The company repurchased 7.7 million shares of stock and eliminated them. Broadcom is also known to hike its dividends annually.\nAVGO Stock is an excellent choice for more conservative investors looking to exploit the AI boom. While Broadcom doesn\u2019t benefit from outsized valuation multiples like Nvidia, its impressive growth is very attractive.\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\nSkyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a chip supplier that derives a significant portion of its sales from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\nIt is similar to Qualcomm, an integral chip supplier to the iPhone maker. Like Qualcomm, Skyworks stock currently includes a dividend yielding 2.6%.\nThe application of generative AI to handsets is still nascent. That\u2019s arguably the best reason to consider Skyworks at the moment. It derives a significant portion of its sales from cell phones. As that market grows, so should company-wide opportunities. Skyworks is positioned to grow with that emerging market.\nInvestors should also note that there are potential pitfalls despite Skyworks\u2019 overall strength.\u00a0 Apple continually makes efforts to bring chip production in-house. Qualcomm has served as an excellent example of that truth.\u00a0 The risk that Apple walks away is one that the company continually has to navigate.\nYet, Qualcomm has proven that it is difficult for Apple to do so. Thus, the overall opportunity for Skyworks seems to be strong.\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Title": "3 Super Semiconductor Stocks (Including Nvidia) to Buy Hand Over Fist for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Revolution",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are just a few of the powerful artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot applications available today. They can interpret and generate text, images, videos, and computer code, which could drive a productivity boom across the global economy.\nBut those AI applications wouldn't be possible without data centers filled with advanced semiconductors, which developers use to build, train, and deploy their models. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang estimates the current $1 trillion installed base of data center infrastructure around the world will double over the next five years because of AI.\nThat creates a substantial opportunity for leading chip companies Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU). Here's why investors might want to own a stake in each of them to ride the AI boom.\nThe gaming industry used to be Nvidia's largest source of revenue, but its graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center are now driving its business forward. In fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's H100 GPU sent the company's data center revenue surging 217% to $47.5 billion, and the current fiscal 2025 year is expected to bring more growth.\nNvidia's H100 is the most sought-after data center chip for AI workloads. Many tech giants are lining up to buy it in large volumes, from Amazon to Oracle to Meta Platforms. But Nvidia will ramp up shipments of its new H200 GPU this year, which could fuel the company's next wave of growth.\nThe H200 can inference -- which means to feed live data to an AI model so it can make predictions -- at twice the speed of its predecessor, and it also consumes 50% less energy, so it's a big cost saver for data center operators.\nLonger term, all eyes are on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, which will power its next-generation chips. The company is expected to ship its Blackwell B200 GPUs next year, which will deliver 15 times the inferencing speed of the H100.\nWall Street expects Nvidia's total revenue to soar 81% to a record $110 billion in the current fiscal year. Despite the 240% gain in its stock over the last 12 months, there is still plenty of room for upside.\nAMD makes some of the world's most popular chips for consumer electronics. They can be found in the Microsoft Xbox Series X and the Sony PlayStation 5, not to mention a long list of personal computers. But AMD recently launched its MI300 series of data center chips in a quest to chase down Nvidia.\nThe MI300 is available as a standard GPU called the MI300X, but it's also available in a combined GPU and CPU configuration called the MI300A. AMD is already shipping the MI300A to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for its El Capitan supercomputer, which will be one of the most powerful in the world when it comes online this year. But a number of leading data center operators, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms, are also lining up to buy the MI300 series.\nWhile AMD is chasing Nvidia in the data center, the company has a dominant market share of 90% in the emerging AI-enabled personal computing industry. Millions of computers from manufacturers like Dell and HP have already shipped with AMD's Ryzen AI chips, which allow users to process AI on-device. That leads to a faster, more responsive experience, because AI workloads don't have to travel to and from the data center.\nIn the recent fourth quarter of 2023, the Ryzen AI series sent the company's Client segment revenue up 62% year over year. Combined with the growing shipments of the MI300 chips -- which could generate $3.5 billion in sales in 2024 -- this could be AMD's biggest year.\nMicron doesn't get as much attention as Nvidia and AMD because it produces memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, which aren't as glamorous as GPUs. However, every GPU requires memory, and it's critical to extracting its maximum performance.\nMicron's latest HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) data center solution was selected by Nvidia to power its new H200. It's an obvious choice because it consumes 30% less power than competing HBM hardware, making it far more cost efficient. Micron is currently sampling a new HBM3E product, which packs 50% more memory into each GPU, allowing Nvidia's customers to bring their AI models to market far more quickly.\nMicron's entire 2024 HBM inventory is already sold out, and much of its 2025 stock is already spoken for, too.\nLike AMD, Micron's AI opportunity is expanding beyond the data center. The AI-enabled chipsets inside new personal computers can require 80% more DRAM content than traditional models, which is great for Micron's business. Many modern smartphones are also fitted with AI chips, which need twice as much DRAM as traditional devices. Samsung's new Galaxy S24 comes with a slew of AI features, and it runs on Micron's hardware.\nMicron's revenue jumped 57% year over year during the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Feb. 29). The company also delivered net income of $793 million, marking a welcome return to profitability after more than a year grappling with falling prices due to an oversupply of chips.\nMicron's forecast for the upcoming fiscal 2024 third quarter (ending June 1) points to accelerated revenue growth of 76%. Micron stock is trading at an all-time high, but it's still cheaper than both Nvidia and AMD, so this could be a great buying opportunity for investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

NVDA, Lam Research Corp. LRCX, Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT, Micron Technology, Inc. MU and ACM Research, Inc. ACMR.\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nThe semiconductor industry is having a bumpy ride. Sales have been steadily making a rebound but the challenges are far from over. However, the future holds promise given the high demand for chips.\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said on Apr 3 that global semiconductor sales totaled $46.2 billion in February, up 16.3% year over year. Sales in February 2023 totaled $39.7 billion.\nHowever, after a steady rise over the past few months, semiconductor sales fell 3.1% from January's total of $47.6.\nRegionally, year-over-year sales increased 28.8% in China, 22% in the Americas and 15.4% in Asia Pacific. However, sales declined 8.5% in Europe.\nJohn Neuffer, SIA president and CEO, said, \"Although month-to-month sales were down slightly, global semiconductor sales in February remained well ahead of the total from the same month last year, a continuation of the strong year-to-year growth the market has experienced since the middle of last year.\"\nThe semiconductor industry's growth stalled after reaching unprecedented heights during the peak of the pandemic.\nRising costs, supply-chain disruptions, and higher interest rates resulting from the Federal Reserve's aggressive efforts to combat inflation acted as headwinds for the industry, particularly as demand slowed during the second half of 2022.\nAs inflation began to ease, alleviating price pressures, demand rebounded.\nAlso, the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI, is expected to stimulate semiconductor sales in the near term. Experts believe that AI has tremendous potential and the world is yet to witness that.\nThis has seen a large number of tech companies exploring the avenue in their bid to grab business opportunities. This is further likely to make semiconductors all the more important in the near term.\nAccording to a forecast by Gartner, global semiconductor revenues are projected to jump 16.8% this year totaling $624 billion.\nGiven the promising future, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks like NVIDIA Corp.,Lam Research Corp., Applied Materials, Inc., Micron Technology, Inc. and ACM Research, Inc., which investors can gain from in the near term.\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA's focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of 14.1% for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 19.5% over the last 60 days. NVDA presently has a Zacks Rank #2.\nLam Research Corporation supplies wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. LAM's products are used by semiconductor manufacturers in front-end and WLP processes, creating memory, microprocessors, and other logic-integrated circuits for a broad range of electronic devices.\nLam Research Corporation's expected earnings growth rate for next year is 19.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.4% over the past 60 days. LRCX presently has a Zacks Rank #2.\nApplied Materials, Inc. is one of the world's largest suppliers of equipment for the fabrication of semiconductors, flat panel liquid crystal displays, and solar photovoltaic cells and modules. AMAT also offers deployment and support services related to the equipment supplied.\nApplied Materials' expected earnings growth rate for next year is 15.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.1% over the past 60 days. AMAT presently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\nMicron Technology, Inc. has established itself as one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Billionaire David Tepper made quite a name for himself on Wall Street. He helms Appaloosa Management -- the hedge fund he founded back in 1993. He has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation\" and also consistently outperforms his peers.\nHe correctly predicted the collapse of the housing market and the resulting financial crisis that led to the Great Recession in 2008. He also loaded up on bank stocks at the depths of the downturn, a strategy that eventually turned a significant profit for Appaloosa investors. With a resume like that, it's no wonder that many investors follow his moves with keen interest.\nIt raised some eyebrows when Tepper significantly reduced his stakes in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) in the fourth quarter while opting to increase his stakes in two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nIn the fourth quarter, Tepper made some big changes to the upper echelons of Appaloosa's portfolio, cutting his stake in Nvidia by 23%. He obviously still sees upside in the stock, as the hedge fund still owns 790,000 shares worth an estimated $678 million). And Nvidia is still Appaloosa's fourth-largest holding at nearly 7% of the portfolio.\nThe sale was likely a calculated move on Tepper's part. After all, Nvidia gained 239% last year and was selling for 65 times earnings and 27 times sales, so its valuation was steep.\nTepper also slashed his stake in Alphabet stock by 16%, though it remains the fund's seventh-largest holding. Appaloosa now owns 2.3 million shares worth about $388 million.\nIn this case, though, there's no obvious catalyst explaining his decision to sell. The stock was still reasonably priced at year's end, trading for 24 times earnings. He may have had concerns about the timing of the rebound in the digital ad market -- which is responsible for the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue -- or questions about how AI will ultimately impact Google's near monopoly in search.\nIn moves that aren't too surprising, Tepper added to his existing stakes in two of Appaloosa's top three holdings, as he's apparently still bullish on their prospects.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) cemented its place as the hedge fund's No. 2 holding as Tepper increased his stake by 4%. This brought the total count to 1.7 million shares currently worth roughly $710 million, or 11.3% of Appaloosa's holdings. Microsoft arguably kick-started the AI revolution when it invested in Chat-GPT creator OpenAI and integrated generative AI capabilities across a broad cross-section of its workplace productivity tools.\nThe biggest opportunity, however, is likely Copilot, its AI-powered digital assistant. Microsoft debuted a number of job-specific versions of Copilot that help automate otherwise time-consuming tasks. The company gained cloud market share, the result of strong demand for its AI tools.\nMicrosoft stock was selling for a slight premium of 34 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, but given its quick move into the AI marketplace and the potential for profits, that valuation is more than reasonable.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was the second of Tepper's Magnificent Seven purchases. He increased his holdings by 5%, bringing Appaloosa's total stake to 3.95 million shares. At their current value of about $711 million, they account for 11% of the portfolio. As the undisputed cloud infrastructure leader, Amazon has a captive audience for its AI products and services.\nThe company released a bevy of helpful tools on its e-commerce platform to streamline the processes of selling goods and buying advertising. Furthermore, Amazon has a long history of managing its online retail business in part with AI systems, which help it maintain adequate inventory levels, surface relevant recommendations, schedule more efficient delivery routes, and more.\nAnd with the stock trading at less than 3 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, Amazon was a steal.\nSo far, Tepper's results from these moves have been mixed. Nvidia stock gained 80% so far this year, which has kept it in its position as the undisputed champion among the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet stock is up 11%. Over the same period, Amazon and Microsoft have gained 20% and 12%, respectively. This suggests that Tepper would have been better off had he not made any changes at all to his allocations to these stocks.\nThere's a lesson here for investors. If the investing thesis for one of your holdings hasn't changed -- even if the stock sports a nosebleed valuation -- it's sometimes best to stay the course. The AI revolution has just started, and while competition is ramping up, Nvidia's AI processors are still the best in the business. And Alphabet has a long track record of successfully deploying AI algorithms to further its business objectives, and there's no evidence to suggest that this time will be any different.\nInfluential economist John Maynard Keynes reportedly said, \"Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\" Applied to this case, I take that to mean it's best not to make investing decisions based on what the broader market is expected to do, but rather to focus on a company's prospects.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Text": "It\u2019s hard to pick a winner in the stock market today. With so many sophisticated market participants and the wide availability of high-quality data on publicly traded companies, the probability of gaining an edge against the market as a whole has become vanishingly small.\nNevertheless, for those who are lucky or perhaps smart enough to pull it off, the rewards from picking winners in the stock market can be impressive. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is one such winner. The GPUs Nvidia specializes in are especially useful in artificial intelligence applications, and with all the hype surrounding AI over the past few years, the company has seen extraordinary success. The five-year return on Nvidia stock is roughly 1,800% \u2014 an eye-popping figure.\nWhile Nvidia may continue to enjoy this level of success, statistically, it\u2019s not very likely. It\u2019s simply difficult for a business to sustain that type of return over a long period of time. Investors looking for the next big thing may want to look away from recent winners.\nCheck Out: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or AmazonLearn More: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nAdvanced Micro Devices is a semiconductor company that has been gaining significant market share in recent years, particularly in the CPU and GPU markets. With its Ryzen and EPYC processors, Advanced Micro Devices has been challenging industry giant Intel Corp. (INTC), while its Radeon graphics cards have been competing fiercely with Nvidia\u2019s offerings.\nAce Zhuo, business development director for the trading technology hosting platform CheapForexVPS, believes Advanced Micro Devices is poised to benefit from the same tailwinds that have driven Nvidia\u2019s outsize returns.\n\u201cAMD stands out for its remarkable strides in CPU and GPU markets, directly challenging industry giants. Their commitment to innovation and the increasing demand for high-performance computing and gaming technologies signal robust growth potential,\u201d Zhuo said.\nAs the demand for computing power continues to grow, particularly in areas like cloud computing, gaming and data centers, Advanced Micro Devices is well positioned to capitalize on these trends and deliver strong growth in the years ahead.\nFind Out: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t SellRead Next: 13 Cheap Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Potential Upside for You\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\n\u201cTo identify stocks with the potential for explosive growth, it\u2019s crucial to look beyond short-term trends and focus on companies with solid fundamentals, disruptive technologies and a strong competitive edge. The rapid adoption of cloud computing and the proliferation of data have created immense opportunities for companies like Snowflake,\u201d said Abid Salahi, co-founder of FinlyWealth.\nSnowflake is a cloud data platform that provides organizations with the ability to store, manage and analyze their data in a scalable and cost-effective manner. The company\u2019s platform is built on top of Amazon Web Services and offers features such as data warehousing, data lakes and data sharing.\nWith the explosive growth of data in today\u2019s digital world, there is a growing need for companies to effectively manage and derive insights from their data. Snowflake\u2019s platform addresses this need by providing a flexible and scalable solution that can handle large volumes of data from diverse sources. As organizations continue to prioritize data-driven decision making, Snowflake is poised to benefit from this trend and could see its stock price soar in the years ahead.\nTry This: If You Bought $1K of Elon Musk\u2019s Favorite Crypto 5 Years Ago, Here\u2019s How Much You Would Have Now\nThe second cloud computing company that Salahi recommended is Datadog, a monitoring and analytics platform that helps organizations gain insights into the performance of their applications and infrastructure. The company\u2019s platform collects and analyzes data from servers, databases, applications and other sources, allowing companies to identify and address issues before they impact their operations.\nWith the shift to cloud computing and the increasing complexity of modern IT environments, the demand for monitoring and analytics solutions like Datadog\u2019s is growing rapidly. By providing real-time visibility into the health and performance of digital assets, Datadog helps companies improve their operational efficiency and deliver better customer experiences. As more organizations embrace digital transformation, Datadog is well positioned to benefit from this trend and could see its stock price soar in the years ahead.\n\u201cWhen it comes to growth stocks with above-average potential, I like Grab Holdings. This firm operates the largest ride-hailing and delivery platform across Southeast Asia, along with an offering of digital financial services. Grab has an expansive footprint in Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines, and its long-term growth potential is substantial, largely due to rising incomes and booming demand for digital services in its operating region,\u201d said Thomas Brock, CFA, CPA, an expert contributor at Annuity.org.\nWith its diverse portfolio of services and strong market presence, Grab is well positioned to capitalize on the rapid growth of the digital economy in Southeast Asia. As more consumers in the region embrace digital services for transportation, food delivery and financial transactions, Grab stands to benefit from this trend and could see its stock price explode in the years ahead.\nCelsius Holdings is a leading manufacturer and distributor of functional beverages, including energy drinks and fitness drinks. The company\u2019s flagship product, Celsius, is marketed as a healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks, with its proprietary blend of ingredients designed to boost metabolism and provide sustained energy without the crash or jitters.\n\u201cEnergy drinks have long been popular, and Celsius is now profitable as it expands into international markets. Its partnership with giant PepsiCo means it\u2019s likely to keep its upward trend,\u201d said Scott Lieberman, founder of Touchdown Money. As the company continues to expand its distribution network and introduce new products, it could see significant growth in its revenue and profitability, driving its stock price higher in the years ahead.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nShould You Buy Groceries at the Dollar Store?\n5 Japanese Cars To Stay Away From Buying\nThe 6 Smartest Things to Do With Your Tax Refund\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: In 5 Years, These 5 Stocks Could Explode Like Nvidia Did\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nNvidia (NVDA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 50%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 84% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -12.3%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 0.6%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.7% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nvidia a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Favorite SoundHound AI Stock?",
        "Author": "  Brett Schafer, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Everything that Nvidia touches right now seems to turn to gold. The euphoria around artificial intelligence (AI) stocks has reached a fever pitch, with investors wanting the next \"hot stock\" in their portfolios.\nNvidia has been the leader in providing companies with computer chips and software for these new AI tools, and is now one of the largest businesses by market cap in the world. Its market value is currently $2.2 billion. The stock is up 500% since the beginning of 2023.\nIt is no surprise then to see SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) rocketing higher after it was revealed Nvidia had invested in the company and formed a product partnership. Should you follow Nvidia and buy some SoundHound AI stock for yourself?\nSoundHound AI is -- as its name implies -- focused on voice AI services. Generally, this means providing businesses automated voice technology. According to SoundHound's website, this includes multiple languages and best-in-class accuracy.\nIn practice, this translates to major partnerships with automotive companies and large restaurant chains. If you've driven in a new Honda vehicle or eaten at a White Castle recently, there's a chance you have interacted with a SoundHound AI product. Companies want to integrate voice technology into their products to hopefully improve the customer experience and reduce monotonous work for employees (such as taking customer orders at a fast food chain).\nSo where does Nvidia fit in? SoundHound AI just announced a partnership with Nvidia to offer on-chip AI using Nvidia's ecosystem of products. This means someone can access SoundHound's voice technology without needing an internet connection. The two companies will be focused on automotive systems, where both already have a strong presence.\nThe good news is that SoundHound AI is growing quickly. Full-year revenue grew 47% in 2023 to $45.9 million, with a major acceleration in Q4 to 80% year-over-year growth.\nManagement keeps announcing major partnerships. Along with Nvidia, the company signed a deal with a large automotive manufacturer to embed its technology all the way through to 2037, is now working with Jersey Mike's, and acquired SYNQ3 (yes, that is actually the company name) to help grow its restaurant product suite.\nThe bad news is, SoundHound AI is highly unprofitable. Its operating margin is a concerning -139% over the last 12 months, and it burned around $70 million in free cash flow in 2023. With less than $100 million in cash on the balance sheet, SoundHound AI either needs to raise money or quickly get to profitability. And it has a long way to go if it is to flip to black.\nVoice AI sounds exciting, but investors should remember that this technology was hyped a few years back with little actual product uptake. Remember all the advertising around Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Alphabet's Google's voice assistant? The most advanced technology companies in the world have poured tens of billions of dollars trying to build voice technology products and have mostly failed.\nWhy will little old SoundHound AI beat them to the punch? I have my doubts. Maybe this is finally the decade where AI voice assistants take off. But if it is, I would bet that companies like Amazon, Google, or Alphabet will win given their huge research budgets and distribution advantages.\nThere is also a concern about SoundHound AI's valuation. At its current stock price, the company trades at a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 26. This is approximately 10x the S&P 500 average and indicates that SoundHound AI may be wildly overvalued. For these combined reasons, investors should not buy SoundHound AI stock right now.\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Frederic Lardinois ",
        "Text": "It's Google Cloud Next in Las Vegas this week, and that means it's time for a bunch of new instance types and accelerators to hit the Google Cloud Platform. In addition to the new custom Arm-based Axion chips, most of this year's announcements are about AI accelerators, whether built by Google or from Nvidia.\nOnly a few weeks ago, Nvidia announced its Blackwell platform. But don't expect Google to offer those machines anytime soon. Support for the high-performance Nvidia HGX B200 for AI and HPC workloads and GB200 NBL72 for large language model (LLM) training will arrive in early 2025. One interesting nugget from Google's announcement: The GB200 servers will be liquid-cooled.\nThis may sound like a bit of a premature announcement, but Nvidia said that its Blackwell chips won't be publicly available until the last quarter of this year.\nImage Credits: Frederic Lardinois/TechCrunch\nFor developers who need more power to train LLMs today, Google also announced the A3 Mega instance. This instance, which the company developed together with Nvidia, features the industry-standard H100 GPUs but combines them with a new networking system that can deliver up to twice the bandwidth per GPU.\nAnother new A3 instance is A3 confidential, which Google described as enabling customers to \"better protect the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data and AI workloads during training and inferencing.\" The company has long offered confidential computing services that encrypt data in use, and here, once enabled, confidential computing will encrypt data transfers between Intel's CPU and the Nvidia H100 GPU via protected PCIe. No code changes required, Google says. \nAs for Google's own chips, the company on Tuesday launched its Cloud TPU v5p processors \u2014 the most powerful of its homegrown AI accelerators yet \u2014 into general availability. These chips feature a 2x improvement in floating point operations per second and a 3x improvement in memory bandwidth speed.\nImage Credits: Frederic Lardinois/TechCrunch\nAll of those fast chips need an underlying architecture that can keep up with them. So in addition to the new chips, Google also announced Tuesday new AI-optimized storage options. Hyperdisk ML, which is now in preview, is the company's next-gen block storage service that can improve model load times by up to 3.7x, according to Google.\nGoogle Cloud is also launching a number of more traditional instances, powered by Intel's fourth- and fifth-generation Xeon processors. The new general-purpose C4 and N4 instances, for example, will feature the fifth-generation Emerald Rapids Xeons, with the C4 focused on performance and the N4 on price. The new C4 instances are now in private preview, and the N4 machines are generally available today.\nAlso new, but still in preview, are the C3 bare-metal machines, powered by older fourth-generation Intel Xeons, the X4 memory-optimized bare metal instances (also in preview) and the Z3, Google Cloud's first storage-optimized virtual machine that promises to offer \"the highest IOPS for storage optimized instances among leading clouds.\"\nNvidia\u2019s keynote at GTC held some surprises\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/nvidias-next-gen-blackwell-platform-will-come-to-google-cloud-in-early-2025/\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock Is Like Cisco Stock Before the Dot-Com Crash? There Are Big Holes in This Theory",
        "Author": "  Beth McKenna, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Recently, I've spotted several article headlines warning Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors to be cautious because its stock's recent big run-up shares key similarities with Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) stock's huge run-up in the 1990s before it crashed in 2000 when the dot-com bubble burst. In just one year, Cisco stock plummeted 77% after hitting its all-time high on March 27, 2000.\nLet's dig into the qualitative reasons why the comparison of Nvidia now to Cisco in the late 1990s isn't a good one. A second article on this topic will focus on the quantitative reasons, including differences in profit margin trends and stock valuations.\nThe above subheading is a reference to Nvidia's business -- and yes, it's an exaggeration because artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers can have thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs).\nNvidia is the dominant maker of GPUs for accelerating the processing of AI and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads in data centers. It has an estimated 90% share of the data center AI GPU chip market, and 80% share of the overall data center AI chip market. It also targets other markets, but its data center business is its largest, accounting for 83% of its revenue last quarter.\nTo be clear -- I'm not saying Nvidia stock is immune to a big decline or even a crash. No doubt, it would plunge if the company's GPUs lost their status as the favored chips for speeding up the training of AI models and the running of AI applications in data centers, and if it failed to develop whatever tech had displaced GPUs for these fast-growing uses. My premise is simply that the comparison of Nvidia now to Cisco in the late 1990s is not a good one. The similarities are only surface deep.\nCisco's CEO in the below chart refers to John Chambers, who led the company from 1995 to 2015. Cisco was founded in 1984 by two Stanford University computer scientists and went public in 1990.\nNvidia has had only one CEO since its founding in 1993, co-founder Jensen Huang. The company went public in 1999.\nQualitative Metric\nCisco Systems Late 1990s\nNvidia Now\nRun by a founder-CEO?\nNo\nYes\nCEO educational background*\nBusiness (including an MBA) and legal\nElectrical engineering (including a master's degree)\nCEO work background*\n- Technology sales at IBM\n- VP of Operations at Wang Laboratories (a now-defunct computer company)\nMicroprocessor design for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\nCompany's primary growth driver\nInternet adoption and growth\nAI adoption and growth, particularly generative AI.*** (A notable secondary driver is the growth of computer gaming.)\nMain products\nInternet networking products (hardware and software) and services. Main hardware products in the 1990s included switches (LAN and WAN)**, access servers, and routers.\nPrimarily GPU chips and related hardware, software, and services. It also offers other chips, such as central processing units (CPUs) and a \"superchip,\" which is basically a combined CPU-GPU.\nCompetitive moat\nModerate-to-high overall\nHigh overall -- Its GPUs and associated hardware and software have a high degree of complexity.\nGrowth strategy\nConsiderable focus on acquisitions\nHeavily organic growth. Acquisitions have mainly been small, except for 2020's $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox, which makes high-performance networking products.\n*According to public records. **LAN = local area network; WAN = wide area network. *** Generative AI is the tech behind OpenAI's extremely popular ChatGPT chatbot, released in late 2022.\nStudies support the theory that stocks of public companies run by founder-CEOs tend to perform better over the long term than those run by non-founders. Huang is a co-founder of Nvidia; Chambers was not involved in founding Cisco.\nHuang's educational and work background before starting Nvidia was in electrical engineering and semiconductor design, respectively. These factors give him a major advantage over CEOs of technology companies whose backgrounds are not as technical, in my view.\nCisco's moat to keep competition at bay in the late 1990s was not as high as Nvidia's current moat. Nvidia's mighty moat isn't just due to the complexity of its products, but also stems from the fact that its ecosystem is huge and growing, thanks to its early mover status in the data center AI chip space. This ecosystem includes \"over 4.7 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets,\" the company said in its annual report filed in February.\nThe moat differences will be more evident in my second article on this topic focusing on quantitative factors. Suffice it to say here that Cisco's profit margins were steadily declining for a few years before its stock plunged. One main reason was competitive pressures on pricing. Nvidia's profit margins are currently at record highs.\nLet's move to the last category in the chart -- growth strategy. Cisco in the 1990s was a corporate equivalent of the iconic video game Pac-Man -- it devoured a lot of companies. From 1993 through July 2000, the company \"acquired or announced our intent to acquire 65 companies,\" it said in its fiscal year 2000 annual report.\nNvidia, on the other hand, is mostly growing organically. Granted, it relatively recently made one huge acquisition, Mellanox, but it had already been growing at a robust pace before this deal. In other words, Nvidia didn't need to \"buy growth.\" And prior to this acquisition, Mellanox was a Nvidia partner, not a competitor, so it didn't buy the company in order to get rid of a competitor.\nGrowth strategies that heavily focus on acquisitions are very challenging to pull off successfully. They take the time and attention of top execs away from focusing on internal innovation. They eat up money that could be spent on research and development.

        "Text": "Investors have been excited about many different growth areas over the years, but few topics have sparked as much enthusiasm as artificial intelligence (AI). Companies with even modest exposure to that area have soared in the past year, sometimes without even showing how they might capitalize on the AI boom.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is an exception to that rule. The chipmaker is directly benefiting from intense demand for its graphics processing units, which form the foundation for data centers that are being built by many of the biggest tech giants on the planet. Nvidia's sales were up a blazing 265% last quarter to $22 billion .\nThe stock's rally, though, has made the stock an incredibly expensive way to gain exposure to the AI boom. Up more than 400% in the past three years, Nvidia shares are now valued at 34 times sales, making it by far the most expensive of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\nThere's a better way to gain exposure to Nvidia and to the wider AI space -- without exposing yourself to ultra-high levels of risk.\nThe Vanguard Growth Fund (NYSEMKT: VUG) is an exchange traded fund (ETF) that's focused on the largest, fastest growing stocks on U.S. stock market. It tracks the performance of the CSPR U.S. Large Cap Growth Index by owning roughly 200 stocks. The fund invests in roughly all market sectors, including real estate, energy, and telecommunications. Yet you can see by its top 10 holdings list that the ETF mainly concerns itself with tech giants. Those holdings are:\n1. Microsoft, 13%\n2. Apple, 10%\n3. Nvidia, 9%\n4. Amazon, 7%\n5. Meta Platforms, 4%\n6. Alphabet, 4%\n7. Alphabet C, 3%\n8. Eli Lily, 3%\n9. Tesla, 2%\n10. Visa, 2%\nThese stocks are among the most popular on the market these days, and that helps explain why the Vanguard growth ETF has outperformed so many peers. It has jumped 33% in the past year compared to the 22% rally in the S&P 500.\nThere's still plenty of risk involved in owning this ETF despite its highly diverse collection of businesses. The tech sector represents nearly 60% of its assets today, and so a downturn in that area would hurt your short-term return, especially if you own a few individual stocks that land in its top holdings list.\nTech giants tends to do well during cyclical upturns like the one investors have seen in the past year but often fall hard when fears are rising about a recession. As a result, this ETF won't provide much protection when markets start heading south. For a more defensive tilt, consider something like the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF.\nStill, you'll get to own Nvidia along with several other companies that are taking advantage of the AI boom by owning this growth-focused ETF. Costs are extremely low as well, with expenses landing at just $4 per $10,000 invested. Peers in this space charge $100 or more for each $10,000 invested.\nIt's true that the ETF won't soar as quickly as Nvidia could given its wider focus. Investors can still enjoy above-average returns from this tech-focused fund that includes the chipmaker as a relatively small part of its blockbuster growth portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Max A. Cherney ",
        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel detailed a new version of its artificial intelligence chip at its Vision event on Tuesday that takes aim at Nvidia's dominance in semiconductors that power AI.\nWHY IT IS IMPORTANT\nTech companies are hunting for an alternative source of the scarce chips that are needed for AI. Intel said that its new Gaudi 3 chip was capable of training a specific large language models 50% more quickly than Nvidia's prior generation H100 processor. It is also capable for computing generative AI responses, a process called inference, more quickly than the H100 chips for some of the models Intel tested.\nKEY QUOTE\n\"Our customers, first and foremost, are asking for choice in the industry,\" said Intel vice president, strategy and product management Jeni Barovian. \"They are coming to us and they are expecting that Intel, as a computing leader, will follow the wave of (generative AI) and deliver solutions that meet their needs. And they are looking for an open approach.\"\nCONTEXT\nIntel and Advanced Micro Devices have struggled to produce a compelling bundle of chips and the software necessary to build AI applications that can become a viable alternative to Nvidia. Nvidia controlled roughly 83% of the data center chip market in 2023, with a majority of the remaining 17% share held by Google's custom tensor processing units (TPUs) that it does not sell directly.\nBY THE NUMBERS\nIntel used Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's 5nm process to build the chips. Gaudi 3 includes two main processor chips fused together, and is more than twice as fast as its predecessor. The chip is designed to be strung together with thousands of others and when done so can generate an enormous amount of compute power.\nWHAT IS NEXT\nThe Gaudi 3 chip will be available to server builders such as Supermicro and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in the second quarter of this year.\nThe next generation of Gaudi chips will be code named Falcon Shores.\n(Reporting by Max A.

TSMC's market cap jumped about 12% to $632.5 billion.\nConversely, Tesla Inc faced the largest market cap drop, falling about 13% to $559.8 billion amid demand concerns, rising competition, and scrutiny over CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package.\nApple Inc experienced a decline, with its market cap dropping 5.1% to $2.65 trillion, amid slowing iPhone sales and a recent $2 billion fine from European regulators for antitrust violations.\nOverall, major tech firms have experienced significant market gains this year. So far in 2024, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and TSMC's market caps have risen 81.8%, 42%, and 26%, respectively.\n\"For investors with excessive exposure to large-cap tech names and looking to diversify beyond the sector, we see opportunities in US small-caps and select European small- and mid-cap stocks,\" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\"We think their performance should approach that of their large-cap peers amid a supportive macro backdrop, and we see value in adding them in portfolios.\"\n(Reporting By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra in Bengaluru; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne)\n"

        "Author": "  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "While the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator market is dominated by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has been trying to gain ground. The company's Gaudi line of AI chips historically couldn't match Nvidia on performance, but Intel pitched them as a cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's pricey graphics processing units (GPUs).\nGaudi 3, Intel's third-generation Gaudi AI chip, was officially unveiled on Tuesday. This time around, Intel is pushing both the performance and cost angles. The company claims that Gaudi 3 beats Nvidia's H100 GPU by 50%, on average, in AI inference tasks, with 40% better power efficiency -- and it will be available at \"a fraction of the cost\" of Nvidia's powerful chip.\nIntel presented impressive numbers, although they should be taken with a grain of salt until third-party benchmarks are performed. The company claims that Gaudi 3 will offer quadruple the AI compute performance over Gaudi 2 using a particular low-precision format and 50% more memory bandwidth.\nOn top of beating Nvidia's H100 in AI inference, Intel also claims that Gaudi 3 outperforms the H100 in multiple AI training tasks. Across three different large language models, Intel claims that Gaudi 3 completes training 50% faster. How these figures change when using a large cluster of Gaudi 3 chips versus a large cluster of H100 chips is unclear, since performance will depend on data-transfer speeds and other factors.\nWhile Nvidia's AI chips are extremely powerful, the company's proprietary software is partly responsible for its dominance. Nvidia's CUDA platform has become the industry standard for accelerated computing and only works with Nvidia hardware.\nIntel and other tech giants are looking to change this situation. Intel technology is at the center of the Unified Acceleration Foundation, a consortium of companies working on an open alternative to Nvidia's CUDA. Separately, Intel is working with companies like Hugging Face, RedHat, Redis, SAP, and VMWare to create an open platform for enterprise AI. Intel's Gaudi 3 also works with industry-standard Ethernet networking, rather than proprietary solutions.\nIntel's Gaudi 3 will be available to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) building AI servers in the second quarter of 2024, with general availability expected in the third quarter. Intel has Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro on board as partners.\nEstimates for how big the AI chip market will become over the next decade vary, but it's safe to say that demand for AI accelerators is set to grow. Intel can benefit in two ways.\nFirst, its Gaudi family of chips and future AI accelerators can go after the AI chip market directly. As software libraries and applications are ported to work with a wide range of AI hardware, Intel's focus on undercutting Nvidia on price while delivering solid performance and efficiency should bring in plenty of customers.\nSecond, Intel is aiming to become the world's second-largest foundry by 2030. Gaudi 3 is manufactured by TSMC, but as Intel ramps up production on its advanced process nodes, it may eventually move manufacturing for its AI chips in-house. Other companies looking to design their own AI chips may also turn to Intel for manufacturing or packaging services, allowing Intel to capture additional revenue from the AI chip market.\nWhile time will tell whether Intel's Gaudi 3 will win meaningful market share from Nvidia, the long-term picture looks bright for the chip giant as demand for AI chips explodes.\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Up Nearly 80% This Year, Does Nvidia's Stock Have Room for More?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After having an incredible 2023, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) hasn't slowed a bit in 2024. It's up nearly 80% this year, placing among the top-performing stocks again in back-to-back years.\nBut because of such a tremendous start, most wonder if Nvidia has room for more upside. I think it does, but there's also a possibility it could reverse course.\nNvidia has been a rockstar of a stock because of its ties to artificial intelligence (AI). Its primary product, graphics processing units (GPUs), are an integral part of training AI models due to their ability to compute in parallel. When GPUs are tasked to train an AI model, companies don't just use one or two of them. Instead, they use thousands to increase the computing power.\nNvidia's flagship GPU for training AI models is the H100, and it costs around $40,000 apiece. When companies purchase these GPUs by the thousands at that price, it's a great sign for Nvidia's business.\nThis has shown up in Nvidia's financial results in a big way, like when its revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22.1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ending Jan. 28). With the infrastructure needed to train all of these AI models not yet built, it's a great sign for Nvidia that the demand for its product will still be high.\nThis is the base thesis on why Nvidia's stock still has room for upside, as no one knows when there will be enough computing capacity to quench the demand for AI training. However, there's a flip side to this coin as well.\nOnce the industry has built out the computing power it needs to satisfy the demand, Nvidia's revenue stream will dry up. Its GPUs are one-time purchases unless a client upgrades, which could be an issue. Nvidia will still be around, as it has multiple other business segments. But, with so much of its revenue coming from this AI demand wave, Nvidia will eventually face a downturn.\nIt's unknown how long it will take to build all the computing power for AI demand or when it will start to plateau. This is the debate behind Nvidia's stock, but we'll get a better glimpse of how it's going in a month.\nWhile Nvidia's stock is up almost 80% this year, it's only up 12% since its last earnings report. That's because most news that drives the stock will be released in that announcement.\nIf past trends hold, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter results should be announced sometime in late May. If Nvidia's management gives positive forward-looking guidance and says it will maintain the status quo, don't be surprised if the stock gains even more. But if management discusses demand leveling out, be prepared for a severe sell-off.\nNvidia has a lot of expectations built into the stock, and one of those is strong growth for all of this year. By looking at the difference between a stock's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio versus its forward P/E, you can calculate the expected earnings growth rate for the year.\nFor Nvidia, that's 109%. So, Nvidia must at least double its earnings, or it will fall short of analyst expectations.\nThat's a high bar to clear, but considering Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) grew by 765% in Q4, it's possible.\nSo, to answer the question, does Nvidia's stock have room for more? I'd say absolutely. If AI demand continues to drive Nvidia's revenue higher than expectations, it could still rise further. But, if it fails to meet those lofty goals, the stock has a long way to tumble.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "At its current share price of $888, Nvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock costs more than 3 times what it did a year ago. It's up 238%, to be precise, and now sells for a seemingly outrageous 37 times trailing sales.\nAnd yet, if you ask the bankers at Raymond James, $888 isn't an unreasonable valuation for Nvidia stock at all. And Nvidia stock could hit $1,100 within a year.\nNvidia shares may cost 3x what they did a year ago, but the stock is actually down 7% from highs hit three weeks ago, when the stock was approaching $1,000. Why? Nvidia may be a victim of its own success, as investors worry artificial intelligence customers will hold off on buying Nvidia's current H100 chips in hopes of buying the company's next generation of Blackwell chips, which are expected to be 4 times as powerful.\nNot to worry, says Raymond James. Keeping its strong buy rating on the stock, RJ argues there's still more demand than supply for AI chips, and buyers will count themselves lucky if they can get even H100s today -- and are unlikely to postpone buying in hopes of getting Blackwells tomorrow. Basically, the thinking is that whether it's H100s, H200s, or B100s/200s -- any AI chips Nvidia is able to build, it will also be able to sell.\nAnd until its competitors catch up, this may remain the case. Far from predicting a slowdown, most analysts agree Nvidia sales are likely to more than double to $60.9 billion this year -- then more than triple over the next four years, hitting $196.3 billion in 2028. That works out to an annualized sales growth rate of 49%. Projections for long-term earnings growth are even more stunning: 92% annualized through 2028.\nAs silly as it sounds, Nvidia stock at 37 times sales, and 76 times earnings today, may actually be cheap.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The new facility in West Lafayette, Indiana will also house a packaging R&D line.\nThe facility \"will help strengthen supply chain resilience\" for AI chips in the U.S., CEO Kwak Noh-Jung said.\nThe engineering talent pool provided by the region's Purdue University, infrastructure for chip manufacturing, and support from the state and local government were factors in the chipmaker's decision, it said.\nSK pledged in 2022 to invest $15 billion in the semiconductor industry through R&D programs, materials, and the creation of an advanced packaging and testing facility in the U.S.\nLast month it began mass production of the latest version of HBM chips, called HBM3E, with sources saying initial shipments are going to Nvidia.\nSK Hynix has been the sole supplier of the version previously used - the HBM3 - to Nvidia, which has 80% of the market for AI chips.\n(Reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Jan Harvey)\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have soared 1,800% over the past five years thanks to the company's dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. And this leadership has translated into enormous gains in earnings, with revenue and net income rising in the triple digits and reaching records in the most recent quarter.\nBut now it's fair to question whether this high demand for tools to power AI -- from Nvidia's chips to its software and platforms -- will last. Nvidia has grown dependent on demand from companies investing in AI and seeking capacity to drive AI projects. Nvidia's data center revenue made up more than 80% of total revenue in the most recent quarter. Well, one particular statistic offers us an answer.\nA little less than a decade ago, most companies weren't talking about AI during their earnings calls, a key moment to speak about important projects and long-term prospects. But this has changed drastically, according to data compiled by Statista.\nThe chart, below, shows that among companies in the Russell 3000 index, more than 16% mentioned AI during earnings calls last year, up from just under 10% the previous year. And this number has soared from less than 1% back in 2015.\nThis is positive because growth in these mentions has almost steadily increased, yet the current level of companies talking about AI leaves plenty of room for growth. And if more companies are talking about AI, that indicates more companies may be launching AI projects, and for this, many of them may turn to chip leader Nvidia.\nAll of this indicates Nvidia's revenue growth may be far from over, and that should lead to further share performance, too. For investors, this means it isn't too late to get in on shares of this AI chip leader. Whether Nvidia stock continues to rise or takes a pause, it still has what it takes to advance over the long haul -- along with demand for AI products and services.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Apple expects the March quarter\u2019s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the December-end quarter. Strong adoption of Apple TV+ driven by strong content is a key catalyst.Apple is gaining share in PCs which is positive.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The speed with which artificial intelligence (AI) caught on last year took many investors by surprise, and it sparked a changing of the guard among the ranks of the world's most valuable companies. Apple was finally dethroned by Microsoft, which now tops the list as the only company that currently has a market cap of more than $3 trillion. Nvidia, fueled by its industry-leading AI processors, has tripled over the past year to take the No. 3 spot, behind Apple with $2.6 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all major players in the AI revolution and also members of this auspicious fraternity.\nWith a market cap of just $53 billion (as of this writing), it might seem like hyperbole to suggest that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, could make a run at the $1 trillion club. However, the accelerating demand for AI-centric servers and the company's decades of expertise suggest that Supermicro is a dark horse candidate in the race.\nWhile Supermicro has been creating customized server solutions for more than 30 years, the company was working in relative obscurity until the accelerating adoption of AI kicked off. It turns out that Supermicro has amassed quite a pedigree out of the glare of the spotlight.\nSupermicro has built its reputation by providing highly customizable, energy-efficient, liquid-cooled rack-scale servers designed to handle the rigors of AI and hyperscale data centers. The company has developed strong working relationships and works hand-in-hand with all the top AI chipmakers to ensure its rack-scale servers are top performers while also providing energy efficiency and the lowest total cost of ownership in the industry. It boasts partnerships with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others.\nThis is a winning strategy that has its AI-centric servers flying off the shelves. For its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), Supermicro's revenue surged 103% year over year to $3.7 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $5.10 jumped 85%. Management is forecasting its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year guidance to $14.5 billion, which would represent growth of 104%.\nManagement reports that Supermicro grew five times faster than the industry average over the preceding 12 months, suggesting the company is stealing market share from its rivals. Analysts at Northland agree, suggesting the company has increased its market share to 11%, leaving \"plenty of room for future share gains.\"\nSupermicro is in an enviable position among AI server makers. The company is small enough to be nimble and has a long history of providing customized server solutions to enterprises. Furthermore, the strong and enduring relationships Supermicro has forged with chipmakers give it the inside track and an abundant supply of the processors used for AI. Despite those advantages and the clear opportunity, a lot will have to go right for Supermicro to join the ranks of the trillionaires.\nAccording to Wall Street, Supermicro is poised to generate revenue of $14.7 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 3.6. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $275 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. To be clear, the company is currently ramping up production to support annual sales of $25 billion, so revenue of that magnitude is still a ways off.\nIf the company were able to keep up its triple-digit, year-over-year growth, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap threshold by 2031. That said, it's unlikely the company will keep up its current rate of parabolic growth. If we cut its revenue growth rate assumption to 50%, Supermicro could potentially reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2035.\nThere's reason to believe strong demand for AI-centric servers will continue. BofA analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya suggests the data center market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% over the next three years, and Supermicro's revenue could grow even faster.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is equally bullish, suggesting that the installed base of data centers will double to $2 trillion over the coming four to five years.\nIf Supermicro captures even a small part of that vast opportunity, the company will soon join the $1 trillion club.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Furthermore, with a top Zacks Rank, it also enjoys increased odds of rallying further in the near future.\nAs we'll cover in the earnings results below, the growth in generative AI has been a significant boon to Vertiv's business and shows no evidence of slowing.\nThe company currently sits in an extremely strategic position within the AI boom, a very encouraging development for shareholders. Here is how Vertiv aids the technological revolution:\nHigh-Density Power and Cooling Solutions: The ever-growing processing power of AI requires robust power and cooling infrastructure. Vertiv's data center solutions are designed to handle the intense heat generated by AI workloads, ensuring optimal performance and preventing overheating.\nTechnical Partnerships: Vertiv actively collaborates with leading AI chipmakers like Nvidia. These partnerships ensure their solutions are specifically tailored to meet the unique power and cooling demands of cutting-edge AI hardware.\nEnd-to-End Expertise: Vertiv doesn't just provide individual components. They offer comprehensive solutions that manage power delivery and heat rejection from the power grid all the way to the individual chip. This holistic approach streamlines AI infrastructure deployment and optimizes performance.\nGlobal Reach and Scalability: The AI revolution is happening worldwide. Vertiv's global presence allows them to support the growing demand for data center infrastructure across different regions. Their scalable solutions can adapt to the ever-increasing power and cooling needs of AI applications.\nIn terms of AI-adjacent stocks to own, Vertiv is easily one of the best verticals to be positioned in.\nVertiv reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 2024 beating estimates for both sales and earnings.\nOrganic orders increased by 60% compared to the same period last year and net sales reached $1,639 million, marking an 8% increase from the first quarter of 2023. Operating profit for the quarter was $203 million, while adjusted operating profit stood at $249 million, reflecting a significant year-over-year growth of 42%.\nThe company also began returning cash to shareholders, repurchasing approximately 9.1 million shares at an average price of $66 per share, which was very well timed as the stock is considerably higher today.\nAdditionally, Vertiv raised its full-year 2024 guidance, expecting net sales growth of 12% at the midpoint, along with increased operating profit and adjusted operating profit. The company attributes its strong performance to robust demand, particularly in AI-driven deployments and liquid cooling technologies, positioning Vertiv for continued growth and operational improvement in the evolving digital infrastructure landscape.\nBased on its importance to the AI ecosystem, its top Zacks Rank and reasonable valuation, I think Vertiv makes for a compelling stock to consider investing in.\nReflecting upward trending earnings revisions, it currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Next quarter earnings have been revised higher by 3.5% and next year's earnings have been increased by 5.5% over the last two months.\nToday, Vertiv has a one year forward earnings multiple of 33.5x, which is well above its two-year median of 21x and below the industry average of 36.9x. While this isn't a discount valuation it certainly isn't too expensive considering how important the products and services are to the AI boom.\nAdditionally, it is forecasting EPS to grow 26.7% annually over the next 3-5 years.\nOver the last couple of weeks some of the leading technology and AI-related stocks have sold off considerably with many down as much as 10%-20%. Two of the leading names in AI jump out to me.\nNvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are both on sale at current levels. Of course, Nvidia is still the stock to own in the space, and even with its incredible price appreciation still has a very reasonable valuation sitting at 34x forward earnings.\nWith the immense demand sparked for products, Nvidia continues to see sales and earnings estimates revised higher, giving them a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.\nAs one of the premium semiconductor producers, AMD also sits in an advantageous spot. It too boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, and projects EPS to grow 25% annually over the next 3-5 years. AMD has also seen some hefty selling with the stock down more the -30% from its recent highs.\nBottom Line\nFor investors looking to add exposure to the AI and technology sector, Vertiv, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia all appear to be worth investment considerations. Thanks to the recent market selloff both AMD and Nvidia are off their highs, although Vertiv pushed to new all-time highs following the earnings report.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Author": "  Sanghamitra Saha ",
        "Text": "At Nvidia's recent GTC AI conference, the company unveiled partnerships in the healthcare sector, representing a strategic move toward expanding its revenue streams beyond tech sectors. These partnerships include collaborations with Johnson & Johnson JNJ for surgical applications and GE Healthcare to enhance medical imaging.\nThe conference also highlighted the launch of about twenty new AI-driven tools personalized for healthcare. Notably, Nvidia's transition from gaming graphics cards to healthcare technology demonstrates the company's power of vision.\nInvestors should also note that AI and robotics are likely to meet drive forward the next wave of healthcare innovations. According to recent findings by Grand View Research, the global AI in healthcare market reached a value of $22.4 billion in 2023. Projections suggest that this market will record a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36% from 2024 to 2030.\nRaj Joshi, a technology analyst at Moody\u2019s Ratings, emphasizes Nvidia's pivotal role in enabling advancements in healthcare technology, as quoted on CNBC. Nvidia's ground-breaking solutions have transformed processes that were previously time-consuming and costly.\nJoshi highlights the transformative potential of Nvidia's technology across various domains within healthcare, such as biotechnology, chemical research, and drug discovery. The biotech sector, in particular, stands to benefit from AI-driven solutions, which can speed up drug discovery processes and discover new applications for existing medications.\nCollaborations with companies like Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Generate: Biomedicines underscore Nvidia's role in facilitating biomedical research through advanced cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities.\nRecursion leverages Nvidia's AI models to analyze biological and chemical data, contributing to the development of novel medications and treatment protocols in collaboration with industry leaders like Roche's Genentech and Schr\u00f6dinger.\nGenerative AI platforms not only expedite drug development but also yield cost-saving benefits for pharmaceutical companies. By automating back-office processes and leveraging AI-powered robotic automation, firms can lower the expenses related to offshoring operations, ultimately channelizing more resources toward drug discovery efforts.\nNvidia\u2019s such efforts put focus on the likes of JNJ-heavy fund iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF IHE and Recursion Pharmaceuticals-heavy fund ARK Genomic Revolution ETF ARKG.

        "Title": "Unlocking Intrinsic Value: Analysis of NVIDIA Corp",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAs of 2024-04-01, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $379.69. It's currently trading at a price of $902.7. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -137.75%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$12.15\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.21%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 41.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n591.55\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n1000.21\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n379.69\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $338.47. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -166.7%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 19, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Winnebago Industries WGO, Nvidia NVDA, Vista Energy VST, Constellation Energy CEG and NRG Energy NRG.\nData centers are integral to the AI buildout because they yield the computational power and storage necessary for training and deploying large language models like OpenAI, ChatGPT and Bard at scale. Running an LLM requites facilities that house numerous servers and specialized hardware optimized for tasks such as deep learning. Unfortunately, these complex systems require a ton of energy due to their intense processing demands and the persistent need for temperature (cooling) regulation.\nAccording to a new report by Bloomberg Intelligence, \u201cThe generative AI market is poised to explode, growing to $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years from a market size of just $40 billion in 2022. Growth could expand at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 42%, driven by training infrastructure in the near-term and gradually shifting to inference devices for large language models, digital ads, specialized software and services in the medium to long term.\u201d\nIn the capitalist system of America, companies are jockeying for position and rushing to catch up to LLMs such as ChatGPT, the current market leader. Meanwhile, the race for AI supremacy is not only domestic. China, America\u2019s most significant economic adversary, is behind the U.S. in terms of AI but is racing to catch up (and has a larger talent pool to choose from). Finally, the oil-rich and deep-pocketed nation of Saudi Arabia is allocating at least $40 billion to join the fight.\nWhen so much competition exists in a high-growth market, it can muddle the picture for investors. For example, thousands of companies went bankrupt during the internet craze, while only a few became dominant. How can investors parse through the noise?\n\u201cDuring a gold rush, sell shovels.\u201d\nSamuel Brannan became the first millionaire of the Gold Rush, but not for the reasons you might expect. Brannan capitalized on the frenzy by providing miners with shovels, picks, and pans.\nWhen oil fracking exploded a handful of years ago, an unexpected industry took off: RV makers, because fracking took place in remote locations with little housing, companies like Winnebago Industries took off as oil companies filled the housing void using RVs.\nThe most well-known company selling the \u201cshovels\u201d to the AI gold rush is Nvidia. However, the utility/energy industry may have an even longer runway than many AI names. Picking winners will become more difficult as the number of competitors in the industry snowballs. That said, the one constant will be the need for energy production.\nFor example, Vista Energy, which offers electricity and power generation, is up 113.7% over the past year, trouncing the S&P 500 Index\u2019s gain of 17.2% over the same period.\nMeanwhile, Constellation Energy holds a coveted Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and analysts see earnings growing by an explosive 551.72% next quarter!\nThe two stocks mentioned, and fellow industry leader NRG Energy are currently extended. However, they would provide solid reward-to-risk on a deeper pullback (to the 50-day moving average).\nPicking winners in a hot industry like AI can be challenging as the competition is fierce. Nevertheless, the one constant is that the proliferation of AI will require a plethora of new energy production.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's no denying that artificial intelligence (AI) has gone viral over the past year or so, with graphics processing units (GPUs) by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) fueling the fire. In recent weeks, however, the stock has stalled, and investors are wondering what's to come.\nOne Wall Street analyst thinks investors are overthinking it.\nMelius Research analyst Ben Reitzes reiterated his buy rating on Nvidia stock while raising his price target to $1,125. That represents potential gains for investors of 28% over the coming year compared to the stock's closing price on Monday. The analyst points to expanding capital expenditures by the \"Big Three\" cloud providers and other big tech companies as evidence that Nvidia stock has further to run.\nThe analyst has a point. Microsoft and Alphabet each reported their first calendar quarter results last week, and both announced plans to increase capex spending to support cloud growth fueled by generative AI. At the same time, Meta Platforms said it plans to boost spending by several billion dollars for the coming year to \"support our AI road map.\"\nReitzes references the current AI \"gold rush,\" saying the large cloud providers \"are all spending ~20% more on chips than we thought over the next few years.\" He goes on to say they're \"spending like crazy\" now, hoping they can \"monetize like crazy\" later. \"Sometimes a no-brainer is a no-brainer,\" he wrote.\nIf you don't believe it, consider this: Nvidia is the leading provider of the GPUs used in data center processing where much of AI systems reside, with an estimated 95% market share. That dominance was evident in Nvidia's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28), as its data center revenue of $18.4 billion soared 409% year over year, driven by the build-out of data centers to support AI.\nWhile Nvidia stock is a bit pricey, selling for 35 times forward earnings, the company's triple-digit growth and market dominance make it worth every penny.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Super Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist, According to Wall Street",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has popped 223% over the past year, catapulting the company to a $2.1 trillion valuation (only Apple and Microsoft are worth more). Nvidia makes powerful graphics processing chips (GPUs) for the data center that are designed to handle artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, and the company is overwhelmed with demand.\nBut while investors are (understandably) laser-focused on Nvidia, they might be overlooking other opportunities in the chip sector. According to The Wall Street Journal, analysts have a consensus overweight (bullish) rating on two other names: Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) and Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ: ACLS).\nHere's why following Wall Street's lead and buying shares of Micron and Axcelis might be an excellent idea.\nMicron is one of the world's largest producers of memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, which are critical in everything from smartphones to data centers. As a result, the company's opportunity in the expanding AI space is already proving to be multifaceted.\nFirst, Micron's latest HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) solution was chosen by Nvidia to power its new H200 data center GPU, which is the successor to its industry-leading H100. Micron's HBM3E memory consumes 30% less power than competing hardware, which makes it an obvious choice as data center operators seek to keep costs down. Unsurprisingly, Micron's high-bandwidth memory is completely sold out for 2024, and most of its 2025 supply has been allocated already.\nSecond, AI workloads are quickly migrating from the data center to computers and devices instead, which creates a faster and more intuitive user experience. The chipsets inside AI-enabled computers are called neural processing units (NPUs), and they require 80% more DRAM capacity than traditional chips. Similarly, Micron expects DRAM content inside mobile devices to double. That translates to more demand and more revenue for the company.\nMicron's chips can already be found in Samsung's latest Galaxy S24 smartphone, which it also advertises as \"Galaxy AI.\" It features a chat assistant, translation assistant, and new camera technologies, all powered by AI.\nMicron stock is already up 47% in 2024 and is trading near an all-time high. Investors were very pleased with its breakout fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Feb. 29). For Q2, it delivered $5.8 billion in revenue, a 57% year-over-year jump. The company appears to have fully recovered from a challenging landscape last year, when it grappled with an oversupply of chips.\nThe Wall Street Journal tracks 38 analysts covering Micron stock, and 27 have given it the highest possible buy rating. The company is forecasting an accelerated revenue growth rate of 76% in the upcoming fiscal 2024 third quarter (ending June 1), so there could be more upside ahead for the shares.\nAxcelis Technologies is often overlooked by investors because it doesn't actually produce any chips. Instead, it makes ion implantation equipment that is critical to the fabrication process. The Wall Street Journal tracks just eight analysts covering Axcelis stock, but the majority of them have given it the highest possible buy rating. It trades at a very attractive valuation right now, so investors might want to follow the Street's lead.\nThe electric vehicle (EV) industry is a significant source of demand for Axcelis, because it's the only ion implant company with complete coverage\u00a0for power device applications. Power devices regulate electric power in workloads with high currents, and chemistries like silicon carbide can help manufacturers deliver hardware that is far more efficient. In EV applications, that leads to shorter charging times and much further battery range (mileage).\nAxcelis expects AI to become an increasingly important source of demand, too. As I touched on in the section about Micron, AI requires significantly more memory and storage capacity than traditional computing workloads, and that means more complex manufacturing processes and more expensive chips.\nAxcelis generated $1.13 billion in revenue in 2023, which was a 22.9% increase from 2022. Its earnings per share (profit) jumped by an even more impressive 36.1% to $7.43. But it gets better, because the company is currently sitting on an order backlog worth a whopping $1.2 billion, so 2024 could be another strong year.\nAxcelis stock is up 390% over the past five years, even after accounting for the recent 46% pullback from its all-time high. Based on the company's 2023 earnings and its current stock price of $104.32, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14. That's a 56% discount to the iShares Semiconductor ETF, which sports a P/E ratio of 32.3, implying Axcelis is far cheaper than its peers in the chip industry as a whole.\nBased on Wall Street's consensus price target of $156, Axcelis stock could soar 50% from where it trades today. However, it would have to more than double just to trade in line with the iShares Semiconductor ETF. Either way investors look at it, there is a very clear case for potential upside.\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Micron Technology wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Better AI Stock: Nvidia vs. Intel",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "A boom in artificial intelligence (AI) shook up the tech world last year. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reignited interest in the technology and highlighted just how far AI had come. As a result, countless companies have pivoted their businesses to the budding sector in an effort to take their slice of a $200 billion pie.\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030, which would see it achieve a valuation nearing $2 trillion by the end of the decade.\nConsequently, it's not too late to invest in AI, and chip stocks are some of the most attractive options. These companies are developing the hardware necessary to train and run AI models, suggesting they'll be well positioned to profit from the AI market's tailwinds for years.\nAs leading chipmakers, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have significant potential in AI. However, these companies are at drastically different stages in their AI journeys, which could mean one has more room to run over the long term.\nSo, let's examine these chipmakers more closely and determine whether Nvidia or Intel is the better AI stock right now.\nNvidia's business has exploded over the last year. Its stock is up 230% since last April. Meanwhile, its quarterly revenue and operating income have spiked 207% and 536%, respectively, thanks to soaring chip sales.\nIn 2023, Nvidia cornered the market on AI graphics processing units (GPUs) while many of its competitors scrambled to catch up. Nvidia's head start allowed it to take full advantage of the increased demand for AI GPUs, capturing an estimated 90% market share.\nNvidia's meteoric rise has some analysts questioning how much room the company has left to run. However, its stock keeps defying expectations, rising 60% in the last three months. Meanwhile, Nvidia's free cash flow has increased by 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, indicating it has the funds to continue investing in AI and retain its market supremacy. \nGiven the massive potential of AI and Nvidia's position in the market, I wouldn't bet against it over the long term.\nNvidia's established role in AI has made it one of the more reliable options. However, it could be worth looking at a company like Intel, which isn't as settled in the industry but could have more growth potential.\nIntel has hit more than a few roadblocks in recent years. Its stock is down about 45% over the past three years after seeing decreased market share in central processing units (CPUs) and ending a more than decade-long partnership with Apple.\nHowever, Intel is making major changes to its business, which could see it come back strong in the coming years. Last June, Intel announced a \"fundamental shift\" to its business, adopting an internal foundry model that it believes will help it save $10 billion by 2025.\nMoreover, Intel is moving into AI. In December 2023, the company debuted a range of AI chips, including Gaudi3, a GPU designed to challenge similar offerings from Nvidia. Intel also showed off new Core Ultra processors and Xeon server chips, which include neural processing units for running AI programs more efficiently.\nIntel is on the road to recovery, but it will take time for its financials to reflect recent changes. As a result, an investment in Intel is recommended for more patient investors who are willing to hold for at least a decade. \nThis chart indicates Intel's stock is trading at a significantly better value than Nvidia's, with a far lower forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio.\nForward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated earnings per share. Meanwhile, P/S divides its market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. These are useful valuation metrics since they consider a company's financial health. And for both, the lower the figure, the better the value.\nAs a result, Intel's lower forward P/E and P/S suggest its stock is trading at a bargain compared to Nvidia's. However, the question is which is the better AI stock, not which is the better value.\nConsequently, the answer lies in the investor. If you're looking to invest in an established AI company that will likely deliver consistent but potentially small gains over many years, Nvidia is the answer.

Working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry.\u201d\nBloomberg/Getty Images\nNvidia currently boasts an estimated 80% share of the market for AI-powering processors.\nThe company used last month\u2019s GTC event to unveil the newest iteration of its lineup, the Blackwell GPU architecture. This architecture could command a 40% premium to the current range for H100 chips, which go for between $30,000 and $40,000 each.\nRelated: Analysts revise AMD price targets as stock hit by muted AI sales forecast\nNvidia is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on May 22.

We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained as demand far exceeds supply.\"\nAdvanced Micro Devices\u00a0 (AMD) , which reported earnings after the market close on April 30, is considered the only real rival to Nvidia's global market dominance. Supply constraints for Nvidia could boost AMD\u2019s newly minted MI300X chip sales.\nHuang, the subject of a recent \"60 Minutes\" profile, told analysts that overall, \"our supply is improving.\"\n\"Our supply chain is just doing an incredible job for us, everything from, of course, the wafers, the packaging, the memories, all of the power regulators, to transceivers and networking and cables and you name it,\" he said.\nPeople may think Nvidia GPUs are like chips, but Huang said the Hopper GPU has 35,000 parts and weighs 70 pounds.\n\"People call it an AI supercomputer for good reason,\" said Huang. \"If you ever look in the back of the data center, the systems, the cabling system, is mind-boggling.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Market watchers were beginning to think that nothing could stop the bull market rally, driven by excitement about the possibilities of artificial intelligence (AI). The past couple of weeks has been a stark reminder of the market's tendency for occasional declines before heading higher.\nFor example, after reaching new heights earlier this month, the Nasdaq Composite has fallen about 7% from its peak (as of market close on Friday), taking a breather before attempting to add to its gains. Investors have begun to wonder if the rally, sparked by recent developments in generative AI, could continue its seemingly relentless climb.\nWith that as a backdrop, chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) jumped 7.4%, semiconductor specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) climbed 4.3%, and storage and memory maker Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) added 2% as of 1:46 p.m. ET. The stocks are rebounding from a sell-off that pounded AI stocks late last week.\nWhile many experts believe the adoption of AI has only just begun, others warn of hype or suggest the AI bubble could burst.\nExamples abound. A headline in The Washington Post last week warned, \"AI Hype Is Deflating. Can AI Companies Find a Way to Profit?\" The Guardian was similarly downbeat: \"From Boom to Burst, the AI Bubble is only heading in one direction.\" While these headlines certainly sound dour, it's important to put them in context.\nBest-selling author and former Motley Fool analyst Morgan Housel called pessimism \"seductive,\" noting that \"pessimism sounds smart,\" but goes on to point out \"the difference between pessimism and optimism often comes down to time horizon.\"\nIt's certainly no fun to watch our investments decline, but it's important to remember it's all part of the cost of admission. So while the recent decline in AI stocks certainly bears watching, there certainly isn't any evidence to suggest the secular tailwinds that are driving AI are abating. Investors with a sufficient investing time horizon should not be dissuaded from staying the course.\nNews that broke today helped remind investors that while AI stocks will continue to be volatile, the future looks bright.\nJapanese holding company SoftBank Group is planning to spend 150 billion yen (roughly $960 million) over the next couple of years to upgrade its data centers to handle the rigors of AI, according to a report in Nikkei Asia. The conglomerate is working to develop \"Japanese-language-specific generative AI with world-class performance\" and is creating the underlying large language model (LLM) that will underpin its generative AI system. Softbank will harness the power of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), according to the report.\nWhile this is obviously an encouraging development for Nvidia, the good news doesn't stop there. Arm Holdings designs many of the core processors used to facilitate AI. Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, for example, employs 144 Arm version 9 (V9) CPU cores -- the company's latest (and most expensive) -- so a deal that benefits Nvidia is also a plus for Arm.\nFurthermore, it isn't just Arm's technology that's critical to the success of Nvidia's AI processors. Micron Technology is a longtime collaborator and partner of Nvidia and a leading supplier of HBM3E memory chips that help accelerate the performance of Nvidia GPUs.\nFinally, despite the massive opportunity represented by AI, these stocks aren't nearly as expensive as you might think. The chart helps illustrate how each of these stocks has vastly outperformed the Nasdaq Composite since the beginning of last year, so investors are certainly getting their money's worth.\nNvidia is currently selling for just 31 times next year's earnings, a bargain considering the company's triple-digit revenue and earnings growth. Micron is also a compelling opportunity, selling for just 3 times next year's sales. Arm is a bit on the pricey side at 57 times earnings and 19 times sales, but that fails to account for the company's expected growth. When measured using Arm's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, its multiple comes in at less than 1 -- the benchmark for an undervalued stock.\nThe runway for generative AI is long, and adoption will play out over years. Investors should buy the very best AI stocks they can find -- including this trio -- and hold on for a wild ride.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA): More Cyclical Than You\u2019d Think",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs semiconductors used in everything from AI to gaming to crypto mining. The company also owns Cuda, an AI training software. I\u2019m bearish on Nvidia, which trades at 76x earnings and what are likely peak profit margins. I believe the company is more cyclical than most people think.\nNvidia, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in electric vehicles, has enjoyed a first-mover advantage in AI. The problem is that, like Tesla in electric vehicles, the competition has increased exponentially, and the company is cyclical and vulnerable to a recession.\nNvidia is no doubt a revolutionary company. The AI language models that it helps power are changing the world. Search has become faster and easier than ever before, and AI will not stop there, with many more use cases on the horizon.\nHowever, much of this revolution is now baked into Nvidia\u2019s financials, with net income having increased from $4.37 billion in year-end 2023 to $29.76 billion in year-end 2024. This is an enormous increase.\nNvidia and the AI revolution look comparable to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the Internet revolution of the late 1990s. I recently checked Intel\u2019s financials from 1993-2000, the period marked by the inception of the Internet. Intel\u2019s net income increased at a much slower pace than Nvidia\u2019s.\nIt took seven years for Intel\u2019s net income to increase 360% vs. one year for Nvidia\u2019s net income to increase 581%. During the recession of 2001, as the Internet bubble deflated, Intel\u2019s net income collapsed 88% from year-end 2000 to year-end 2001.\nI suspect Nvidia\u2019s profits will be no less cyclical than Intel\u2019s. Yet, the market is pricing in an unending upward trend in the company\u2019s earnings. The fact that Nvidia\u2019s net income increased so fast means there\u2019s less growth ahead, not more. If Nvidia\u2019s customers suffer in a recession, which I believe they will, Nvidia will suffer too in terms of falling earnings.\nIn Nvidia\u2019s annual report, the company outlined these risks, saying, \u201cBecause most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s operating margin is at a record high of 54%, but if we look at the company\u2019s history, its average operating margin is closer to just 20%. In a cyclical industry like chip designing, this is a red flag. It means earnings could fall more than 50% just to get back to the norm. In recessions, things can get even worse. Nvidia\u2019s operating margin approached the low single digits in the recession of 2003 and went negative in 2009.\nThere are two reasons Nvidia\u2019s margins could contract. One is the economic weakness we discussed earlier, which could affect Nvidia\u2019s customers. Two is increasing competition, which is now coming from everywhere, including Nvidia\u2019s own customers.\nThis risk was outlined in Nvidia\u2019s annual report, which stated, \u201cOur partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.\u201d\nAll the semiconductor investment we\u2019re seeing, spurred by AI hype and governmental support, is bad news for Nvidia. Big tech companies are spending billions on in-house solutions, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel are racing to catch up, and China is attempting to become semiconductor self-reliant.\nI hate industries that are seeing a lot of investment and increasing competition because that\u2019s usually bad for future profit margins. Nvidia was developing AI solutions in a sleepy market for years, but that has all changed now. AI is the hottest market there is, and new competitors are spending R&D money hand over fist. For this reason, I cannot be sure who will have the technological edge in 10 years\u2019 time. Just as Intel has, Nvidia could easily lose its edge over the years.\nDespite having seen its net income and margins explode upwards, Nvidia is now trading at 76x earnings, 36x sales, and 51x book. Normally, you see the market pricing in that a company is nearing a cyclical peak when earnings surge 581% year-over-year by assigning lower multiples. However, this is certainly not the case for Nvidia.\nCurrently, 39 out of 41 analysts covering NVDA give it a Buy rating, two rate it a Hold, and zero analysts rate it a Sell, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus rating. The\u00a0average Nvidia stock price target\u00a0is $989.53, implying upside potential of 9.2%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $620 per share to a high of $1,400 per share.\nI believe Nvidia is comparable to Intel near the peak of the dot-com bubble. Intel benefited from the Internet boom, with a dominant position in semiconductors used in PCs and technologies used for Wi-Fi. However, as competition increased, overinvestment ran rampant, and demand fell, Intel\u2019s stock and earnings collapsed alongside those of other dot-com names.\nThe same could happen to Nvidia as semiconductor investment has surged in big tech land and China. With a 581% year-over-year increase in earnings, Nvidia\u2019s profits could be nearing a peak. The next recession may mark the end as orders for Nvidia\u2019s products can quickly be canceled due to an industry-specific downturn, wide-scale recession, or substitution for another company\u2019s products.\nDisclosure\n"

As you can see from the chart, there wasn't a defining trend for Nvidia last month, though it got a strong start out of the gate.\nNvidia has emerged as the leader of the AI boom, as the company's GPUs (graphics processing chips) and Superchips have been in such high demand that it's been unable to fill it.\nNvidia stock jumped to start March, as it seemed to benefit from a surge in shares of fellow AI winner Super Micro Computer, after that stock, which specializes in AI servers, jumped after being admitted to the S&P 500.\nAI stocks have had a tendency to travel in tandem, as good news for one is often good news for another, and Nvidia and Super Micro Computer are close partners.\nLater in the month, Nvidia unveiled its new Blackwell platform at its developer conference, and CEO Jensen Huang shared his vision for the company and AI in a keynote address. Nvidia said the new platform will allow organizations to run real-time generative AI for programs like large language models at up to 25 times less costs and energy consumption than the Hopper predecessor.\nNvidia also made several other announcements of new products and partnerships that left investors with the impression that the company was well positioned to maintain its lead in AI. Analysts generally weighed in on the conference with price target hikes and favorable commentary.\nFinally, Nvidia stock cooled off in the last week of March on little company-specific news.\nThere's no question that Nvidia is dominating the market for AI hardware, but there are a number of companies racing to try to break Nvidia's grip on the technology, including some of its biggest customers, like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms.\nIf the company can remain the clear leader in AI, the stock is likely to continue advancing, but Nvidia investors should pay attention to the competition as a serious threat could dent Nvidia's fat profit margins.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Technology stocks have been in high demand over the past year or so, driving the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite to new heights. The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to lead that charge higher.\nLike many investors, billionaires are intrigued by the potential to profit from these next-generation algorithms and have piled into AI stocks like there's no tomorrow. Recent research by The Motley Fool shines a light on the most popular technology stocks held by billionaire hedge fund managers.\nIt should come as a surprise to almost no one that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is near the top of the list. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been instrumental in facilitating AI processing, leading to triple-digit revenue and profit gains last year and headlines galore. What they might find surprising, however, is that two AI tech stocks are owned by more hedge funds, while another is neck and neck with Nvidia.\nLet's look at the three tech stocks -- not named Nvidia -- that are most widely held by billionaire hedge fund managers.\nResearchers at The Motley Fool examined 16 hedge funds that are run by billionaires to ascertain what some of the wealthiest investors had in their portfolios. The data was obtained by reviewing each of the funds' fourth-quarter 2023 13F forms -- the quarterly report filed by institutional investment managers with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the end of each quarter. The report discloses their portfolio holdings.\nThe study then compiled a list of the technology stocks that appeared in the top-10 holdings of more than one of the hedge funds reviewed. And the results were telling.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) topped the list, a top holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires:\nRenaissance Technologies (Jim Simons).\nBridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio).\nBlueCrest Capital Management (Michael Platt).\nMillennium Management (Israel Englander).\nTiger Global Management (Chase Coleman).\nE. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw).\nTwo Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel).\nThe Children's Investment Fund (Christopher Hohn).\nSoros Fund Management (George Soros).\nCaxton Associates (Bruce Kovner).\nViking Global Investors (Andreas Halvorsen).\nThe company's dominant Google Search gives it access to a vast treasure trove of data, which is needed to adequately train generative AI models. Its search business also forms the foundation for its industry-leading, digital-advertising business, capturing roughly 30% of the market last year.\nBillionaire Bill Ackman, who is also a fan, detailed the reasoning behind Pershing Square Capital's large stake in Alphabet: \"We continue to believe Google is one of the most advantaged and scaled players in AI with an unmatched business model.\" He went on to cite the stock's compelling valuation -- which is still attractive -- currently trading at less than 27 times trailing-12-month earnings, making it one of the best bargains among AI tech stocks.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) (NASDAQ: GOOG) also topped the list, a top holding of 11 hedge fund billionaires:\nCitadel (Ken Griffin).\nRenaissance Technologies (Jim Simons).\nBridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio).\nMillennium Management (Israel Englander).\nTiger Global Management (Chase Coleman).\nE. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw).\nTudor Investment Corp. (Paul Tudor Jones).\nCoatue Management (Philippe Laffont).\nTwo Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel).\nCaxton Associates (Bruce Kovner).\nViking Global Investors (Andreas Halvorsen).\nThe company boasts the world's most widely used family of social media platforms. About 3.2 billion people visit one of its sites every day, and 4 billion stop by monthly. This provides the company with a large horde of data. Meta surprised tech aficionados by developing its own Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which is now available for hire on all the major cloud platforms, representing an entirely new revenue stream.\nIts AI chops aside, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates recently addressed some of the market's most popular tech stocks, saying he views \"Alphabet and Meta as somewhat cheap.\" Dalio has a point, and that might help explain Meta's popularity among the billionaire set. Meta is currently selling for about 25 times forward earnings, a discount compared to a current multiple of 27 for the S&P 500.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) was tied with Nvidia, a top holding of 10 hedge fund billionaires:\nCitadel (Ken Griffin).\nBridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio).\nMillennium Management (Israel Englander).\nTiger Global Management (Chase Coleman).\nE. Shaw & Co. (David Shaw).\nTudor Investment Corp. (Paul Tudor Jones).\nCoatue Management (Philippe Laffont).\nTwo Sigma Investments (John Overdeck and David Siegel).\nThe Children's Investment Fund (Christopher Hohn).\nCaxton Associates (Bruce Kovner).\nWhile Microsoft's software offerings and recurring revenue are no doubt appealing, the company has a big catalyst directly tied to AI -- namely, its generative AI-powered assistant, Copilot, a suite of helpers deeply integrated into the company's most popular products and services.\nCopilot streamlines a growing list of otherwise time-consuming tasks, helping users to be more productive. In fact, the initial versions were so successful Microsoft is rolling out a number of job-specific Copilots geared toward the sales, customer service, and finance industries, which will likely enjoy similar success.\nWe don't yet know how much this program will add to Microsoft's sales, but the numbers will likely be significant. Billionaire Dan Loeb of Third Points suggests the introduction of Copilot \"could increase [Microsoft's] revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne is even more bullish, suggesting Microsoft's generative AI efforts could produce incremental revenue of $143 billion by 2027.\nAt 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft isn't nearly as cheap as the other two stocks in our trio, but consider this: The company already has a clear path to profit from AI, which could be lucrative.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAs of 2024-04-15, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $379.69. It's currently trading at a price of $881.86. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -132.26%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run.

GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.57%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 41.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n591.55\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n1000.21\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n379.69\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $338.47. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -160.54%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

STR and Primerica PRI.\nIrrespective of whether it is a start-up or a well-known company, earnings growth is the top priority for any organization. This is because if the company doesn\u2019t make money, it won\u2019t survive.\nSo, what\u2019s earnings growth? Study a company\u2019s revenues over a given period, subtract the production cost, and you have earnings. By the way, this is also considered the most important variable influencing the share price. But, expectations of earnings play a striking role.\nNonetheless, stocks such as Volvo, Dycom Industries, NVIDIA, Sitio Royalties Corp. and Primerica are currently exhibiting superb earnings growth.\nFrequently, we have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company\u2019s earnings failing to meet market expectations.\nEarnings estimates embody analysts\u2019 opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 15, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft MSFT, NVIDIA NVDA, Twilio TWLO, Meta Platforms META and Zscaler ZS.\nThe year 2024 has thus far proved to be a landmark for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, propelled by the technology's rapid growth and accelerating adoption across myriad industries. From healthcare revolutionizing drug discovery and patient care to finance harnessing AI's predictive prowess to manufacturing and optimizing processes with machine learning, AI's disruptive influence cast a broad footprint.\nPer a Grand View Research report, the global artificial intelligence market size is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030. It is projected to reach $1,811.8 billion by 2030.\nVarious companies are implementing AI-based solutions such as RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to enhance the process workflows to handle and automate repetitive tasks. AI-based solutions are also being coupled with IoT (Internet of Things) to provide robust results for various business processes.\nThe AI in hardware market is poised for remarkable expansion, projected to swell from $20.88 billion in 2023 to $25.96 billion in 2024, exhibiting an impressive 24.3% CAGR. This trajectory is anticipated to persist, with the market forecast to reach $58.61 billion by 2028, maintaining a robust 22.6% CAGR. Key trends expected to shape this period encompass the accelerated pace of urbanization, further dissemination of internet connectivity, the continued evolution of smart city infrastructures, a rising appetite for self-driving vehicles, and an intensifying need for cloud-based computing capabilities.\nGenerative AI and AI-related startups have attracted close to $50 billion in investments since 2023, affirming the growing interest in the technology and its applications. Microsoft invested close to $13 billion in OpenAI as it sought to gain a front seat in the startup's AI innovations. Anthropic is one of the startups that raised close to $2 billion from investors led by Google as it sought a valuation of close to $30 billion.\nGartner estimates 240 million GenAI smartphones and 54.5 million AI PCs will be shipped worldwide by the end of 2024, representing 22% of all PCs and basic and premium smartphones, respectively. PC shipments are also expected to grow 3.5% in 2024, while smartphone shipments are expected to grow 4.2%.\nAmid the fervent AI boom, shareholders have been hunting for the pioneers and visionaries adept at monetizing AI's capabilities to deliver both ground-breaking innovation and substantial returns.\nHere, we have picked four tech stocks, NVIDIA, Twilio, Meta Platforms and Zscaler, which, apart from boasting strong fundamentals, have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). Per Zacks\u2019 proprietary methodology, stocks with such a perfect mix of elements offer solid investment opportunities. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nNVIDIA is a leader in AI technology, particularly in the development of GPUs used for machine learning and AI applications. With its continuous innovations in AI hardware and software, NVIDIA stands poised to benefit from the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across various sectors, including gaming, data centers, autonomous vehicles, and more. Last week, NVIDIA forged a partnership with Indonesia's telco firm PT Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison to build an artificial intelligence (AI) center in Central Java in 2024.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell platform promises to power a new era of computing by enabling organizations worldwide to build and deploy real-time generative AI models on an unprecedented scale. With a focus on efficiency, performance and scalability, Blackwell aims to address the evolving needs of industries ranging from data processing to generative AI. Manufactured using a custom-built 4NP TSMC process, Blackwell GPUs feature two-reticle limit GPU dies connected by a high-speed chip-to-chip link, enabling unprecedented computational power.\nNvidia sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA\u2019s 2024 earnings has moved north by 2.6% to $23.72 per share in the past 60 days, which suggests year-over-year growth of 83.02%.\nTwilio has enhanced its Flex platform with new features like Unified Profiles and Agent Copilot to improve customer support departments by boosting efficiency and productivity. Unified Profiles, powered by Twilio Segment, enables clients to access native data layers for personalized interactions. Agent Copilot uses this data, along with AI, to help employees automate tasks and work more efficiently. The new features will use AI to reduce costs associated with traditional engineering methods for merging and utilizing data.\nThe company has been rapidly expanding in the AI space through partnerships and product launches. Amazon and Twilio collaborated to enhance the latter\u2019s platform with predictive AI technology. The two companies combined Amazon SageMaker technology and Twilio Segment\u2019s Customer Data platform to enable TWLO\u2019s clients to better understand their customers. Twilio, alongside Google Cloud, aimed to incorporate generative AI into its Flex and Customer Engagement platforms.\nTwilio carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. The consensus mark for the company\u2019s 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 11.4% to $2.64 per share over the past 60 days, which indicates a 7.76% increase from 2023.\nZscaler, a pioneer in cloud security, has announced a groundbreaking advancement in AI innovations through its acquisition of Avalor. This move underscores ZS' commitment to fortifying its platform with cutting-edge capabilities. This collaboration empowers enterprises to automate AI-driven analytics and decision-making in real-time, streamlining reporting, incident mitigation and advanced threat detection within the Zscaler cloud security platform.\nZscaler Zero Trust SASE is the industry\u2019s first single-vendor SASE solution, which is built on the company\u2019s Zero Trust AI. It helps organizations cut down on costs and simplify security by implementing the Zero Trust measures for users, devices and workloads.\nZscaler carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s fiscal 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 10.5% to $2.73 per share in the past 60 days, which calls for an increase of 52.5% on a year-over-year basis.\nMeta Platforms is testing Meta AI, its large language model-powered chatbot, with WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger users in the United States, India and parts of Africa. The move signals how Meta plans to tap massive user bases across its various apps to scale its AI offerings.\nMeta unveiled Meta AI, its general-purpose assistant, in late September. The AI chatbot is designed to answer user queries directly within chats, as well as offer them the ability to generate photorealistic images from text prompts. In collaboration with Microsoft, Meta unveiled the next generation of Large Language Model Meta AI (\u201cLlama\u201d), called Llama 2. The social media giant also released Code Llama, a large language model (LLM) that can use text prompts to generate and discuss code. The company confirmed earlier this week that it will be launching Llama 3, the next version of its open-source LLM, within the next month.\nMeta Platforms currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s 2024 earnings has been revised 1.1% upward to $20.03 per share in the past 60 days, which suggests year-over-year growth of 34.7%.\nThe potential growth in the AI sector is substantial, and these companies stand out for their innovative AI solutions, making them compelling choices for investors eyeing the burgeoning AI market in 2024. These companies represent a diverse range of AI applications, from hardware to software, and across various industries. The increasing integration of AI into everyday life, industries, and businesses positions these companies for potential growth in 2024 and beyond.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

To listen to the podcast, click here: \u00a0https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2258004/what-are-genzs-favorite-stocks)\nWhat Are GenZ's Favorite Stocks?\nWelcome to Episode #398 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.\n(0:45) - What Can We Learn From Generation Z Investing Trends?\n(5:40) - Stocks To Keep On Your Watchlist Right Now\n(37:00) - Episode Roundup: MSFT, NVDA, SG, RDDT, CEG, RIVN, HOOD\n Podcast@Zacks.com\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\nThis week, Tracey is joined by Ethan Feller, Zacks Stocks Strategist, to talk about the next generation of investors, GenZ.\nThe oldest of GenZ are now approaching 30. They have been out in the workforce for several years and many of them are now investing in stocks. This generation also came of age with financial apps like Robinhood on their phones already. They have embraced fintech.\nNo one would be surprised to know that GenZ investors like technology and don't like some of the old economy industries like fossil fuels. Tracey also hasn't heard about them rushing into the bank stocks either.\nBut clean energy, especially nuclear, appears to be high on their list. And big tech, especially the Mag 7, even if those companies have been around for many decades, are also in the picture.\nSome stocks, like Tesla, which were popular with Millennials, appear to be out-of-favor with younger investors. Perhaps Rivian is more their steam?\nEvery generation also comes of age amidst a new restaurant brand. Baby Boomers had McDonald's. GenX had Starbucks. Millennials had Chipotle. What will it be for GenZ?\n1. Microsoft Corp. MSFT\nMicrosoft went IPO in 1986, well before GenZ was even born. It isn't exactly a \"new\" technology company. But it has its hands in many areas, including generative AI thanks to its investment in OpenAI.\nShares of Microsoft are up 7.8% year-to-date after pulling back from recent all-time highs. GenZ likes companies that pay dividends, and Microsoft pays one, currently yielding 0.7%.\nAre you surprised GenZers are interested in owning Microsoft?\n2. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\nNVIDIA is the leader in AI chips in 2024 but prior to AI, it was the leader in gaming. Is it any surprise, then, that GenZ wants to own NVIDIA?\nShares of NVIDIA are up 70.7% year-to-date but have pulled back off their all-time highs over the last month, falling 3.8% in that period. NVIDIA also pays a dividend, currently yielding just 0.02%. It's just $0.16 a share so investors aren't really owning it for the yield.\nNVIDIA may seem expensive, but it's trading at just 35x forward earnings.\nIs NVIDIA a \"generational\" must-own stock for GenZ?\n3. Sweetgreen, Inc. SG\nSweetgreen is a fast-growing restaurant chain that is popular with GenZ and Millennial consumers as it serves healthy food. Sweetgreen shares have taken off in 2024, rising 84% year-to-date. But over the last month, shares have pulled back by 6.3%.\nSweetgreen is still a small cap company, with a market cap of just $2.4 billion.\nWill Sweetgreen be GenZ's generational restaurant chain, like McDonald's was for the Baby Boomers?\n4. Constellation Energy Corp. CEG\nConstellation Energy is a leading provider of nuclear energy in the United States. It has a market cap of $58.4 billion. GenZ is very interested in clean energy companies. Additionally, Constellation Energy pays a dividend, which GenZ loves. It's currently yielding 0.8%.\nShares of Constellation Energy are up 57% year-to-date. It still has an attractive PEG ratio, however, of 0.9. A PEG under 1.0 indicates a company has both growth and value.\nShould Constellation Energy be on your short list?\n5. Rivian Automotive, Inc. RIVN\nRivian manufactures electric vehicles. GenZ has come of age with EVs like Tesla being commonplace. Why not invest in it?\nShares of Rivian have plunged this year as sales of EV cars and trucks have slowed. Rivian recently announced another round of layoffs. Shares are down 62.3% year-to-date. But earnings are still expected to rise 19.3% this year.\nIs this a buying opportunity in Rivian?\nWhat Else Should You Know About GenZ's Favorite Stocks? \nTune into this week's video podcast to find out.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

In late 2022, OpenAI, which counts tech behemoth Microsoft as its largest investor, sparked the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution with the release of its \"chatbot\" ChatGPT. ChatGPT, which leverages a large language model (LLM), allows users to get answers to almost any question in the world instantly.\nThough artificial intelligence has been around for decades, ChatGPT was the first proof of concept, becoming the fastest consumer app to reach the milestone of 100 million users and sparking other tech companies like Alphabet to rush in and enter the AI fray.\nUndoubtedly, investors have enjoyed a bull market over the past year, as evidenced by rising equities and a breakout to new highs, strong earnings, and broad-based participation. Like most bull markets, the stocks with the most robust growth are the ones that lead. In this market, artificial intelligence-related stocks are clearly the industry leading the way. In a recent podcast, Elon Musk said, \"AI is the fastest advancing technology I've seen of any kind, and I've seen a lot of technology.\" Though I am far from a technologist, I have been around Wall Street for multiple decades, and I, too, have not witnessed this type of earnings growth.\nAfter a tremendous move, AI-related names such as Nvidia,Super Micro Computer, Arm Holdings are finally retreating as inflation worries spook U.S. investors after a hotter-than-expected CPI reading.\nWhether you caught or missed the move in AI-related stocks, now is the time to revisit them. Below are three important reasons why, including:\nAs I have said before, institutional investors tend to defend the intermediate-term 10-week moving average in bull markets, and the area historically provides a fantastic reward-to-risk ratio for investors. For example, shares of NVDA, which trended from $500 in January to nearly $1,000 per share, are retreating uniformly to their 10-week moving average.\nAs the race to AI dominance intensifies, Wall Street sees earnings growth in several AI-related names gaining momentum. For instance, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that Super Micro Computer will grow quarterly earnings by triple digits over the next two quarters, which is not too shabby for a $50 billion company.\nA lack of selling after a monstrous gain is a simple yet effective signal that bulls are not rushing to part with shares. ARM shares exploded 62% after reporting monstrous earnings in February. Since then, shares have digested those gains and have held the earnings gains entirely \u2013 a sign that bulls are in control.\nAmateur investors often hope for a pullback but never pull the trigger when it occurs. That said, a pullback in AI stocks may offer a juicy reward-to-risk zone to take advantage of.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRK.B), NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Bank of America Corp. BAC, Occidental Petroleum Corp. OXY and Chevron Corp. CVX.\nWarren Buffett is unquestionably the paragon of well-reasoned investing. He entered the investing game quite early and accomplished tremendous success by placing bets on companies having competitive advantages.\nBuffett believes in acquiring and holding companies that have a promising business model, generate income unswervingly, and provide dividends, indicating sustainable growth. Companies that generate plenty of cash also fall under the ambit of the Oracle of Omaha\u2019s investment viewpoint.\nIt is, thus, worth mentioning that Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway Inc has been loading up on oil companies in recent times. However, most market participants are consumed by AI optimism, betting big on semiconductors like NVIDIA Corporation (read more: Nvidia a Must-Buy After AI-Fueled Blowout Earnings).\nWarren Buffett\u2019s inclination toward energy players is due to an uptick in oil prices for quite a while. Brent crude is approaching the $90 a barrel mark, which is a significant high, while the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is advancing to the $86 a barrel mark, the highest level in five months.\nBank of America Corp.\u2019s analysts also have raised their crude oil forecast for this year. Oil prices are gaining traction amid prospects of higher demand and supply shortages owing to the geopolitical crisis.\nThe American Petroleum Institute recently reported that there has been a drop in U.S. inventories, with crude oil shedding 2.3 million barrels. At the same time, expansion in manufacturing activity in China for the first time in six months in March indicates growing demand for oil soon.\nOn the other hand, a Ukrainian drone strike on a Russian refinery and Israel\u2019s strike on Iran\u2019s embassy in Syria are all set to disrupt the supply of oil.\nThus, with oil prices advancing after taking a beating at the end of 2023, it\u2019s prudent for investors to keep an eye on Warren Buffett\u2019s favorites, Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Chevron Corp.\nDuring the first week of February, Warren Buffett spent a whopping $245.7 million on purchasing shares of Occidental Petroleum. The company has become one of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s top public equity holdings.\nOccidental Petroleum has come a long way from going bankrupt in 2020 to being one of the most sought-after oil companies this year. Production from Permian resources stood in good stead for Occidental Petroleum. Its operation in the Permian Basin is expected to expand, banking on the company\u2019s acquisition of CrownRock L.P.\nOccidental Petroleum\u2019s sale of non-core assets helped trim its outstanding debt. Occidental Petroleum has kept operational expenses under check and generated considerable income from sales since its net profit margin is 16.2%, more than 10%, signifying a healthy margin.\nOccidental Petroleum has solid fundamentals since it has paid constant dividends to its shareholders. In the past 5-year period, OXY has increased its dividend four times, and its payout has advanced 0.8%. Occidental Petroleum has a dividend yield of 1.31%. Check Occidental Petroleum\u2019s dividend history here.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its next-year earnings has increased by 1.9% over the past 30 days. OXY\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the next year is 34.4%. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nChevron also occupies a top spot in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s equity holdings. Chevron\u2019s leading position in the money-spinning Permian Basin is providing the company with maintainable production growth. The company\u2019s present acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to help it sustain earnings growth and cash inflows.\nChevon has an encouraging net profit margin of 10.6%. In the past 5-year period, CVX has increased its dividend five times, and its payout has advanced 6.1%. Chevron has a dividend yield of 4.08%. Check Chevron\u2019s dividend history here.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased by 2% over the past 30 days. CVX\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the next year is 18.7%. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3.\nShares of Occidental Petroleum and Chevron have gained 13.4% and 7.6%, respectively, so far this year.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.
