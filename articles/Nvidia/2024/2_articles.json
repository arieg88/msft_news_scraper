        "Author": "  Sanghamitra Saha ",
        "Text": "The NVIDIA NVDA stock is again a blockbuster this year as it jumped 44% courtesy of high hopes from artificial intelligence (AI). A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.\nThe chip giant has witnessed an impressive 228.8% rally in its stock price over the past year. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)\u00a0and\u00a0it is a growth stock as well as pricey too.\u00a0NVIDIA\u2019s P/E (ttm) ratio 76.13X versus the semiconductor industry\u2019s P/E ratio of 26.53X. NVIDIA\u2019s\u00a0expected growth rate for next year is 63.17%\u00a0versus the expected growth rate of 14% for the industry \u00a0and 4.96% for the S&P 500.\nDespite this remarkable run, Goldman Sachs remains bullish on the company's prospects and has raised its price target for Nvidia from $625 to $800, marking a potential upside of 21% from the previous Friday's closing price. This positive outlook has driven Nvidia's stock to new heights, with its market valuation now reaching $1.7 trillion, per a Business Insider article.\nGoldman Sachs analysts are confident that Nvidia's Data Center revenue will not fall in the second half of 2024, as previously anticipated. Instead, they expect a persistent uptick in Data Center revenue throughout the first half of 2025.\nThis positive outlook is attributed to several factors, including continued investments by major cloud service providers in generative AI infrastructure, a widening customer base, and the introduction of new product cycles.\nNvidia's reaffirmation of its conviction in growing Data Center revenue beyond CY2024, based on clear visibility into capital spending patterns among major cloud service providers.\nGoldman Sachs points to recent commentary from major cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet as evidence that Nvidia is poised to benefit from continued spending on AI-enabling GPU chips like the H100. These cloud giants have reported increased adoption and monetization of AI-related services and products, contributing to Nvidia's growth prospects.\nNvidia\u2019s competitor AMD's revised 2024 Data Center GPU revenue outlook indicates a substantial increase, further validating the market's potential. Marvell's positive comments about its optical DSP and custom compute businesses led Goldman Sachs to adjust its revenue forecasts for the Data Center segment, the IBD article indicated.\nForward guidance from Super Micro suggests an acceleration in revenue growth, reflecting increased demand for Nvidia's products. Positive commentary on AI-related capital spending by hyperscalers, with Meta Platforms increasing its 2024 capex guidance is another factor that can boost Nvidia\u2019s business. Goldman Sachs anticipates that Nvidia will ramp up production of its next-gen H200 hyperscaler in the second quarter of 2024.\nGoldman Sachs is not alone in its optimism, as Bank of America also raised its price target for Nvidia to $800 last week, underscoring the belief that the demand for AI technologies remains in its booming stage and will continue to drive Nvidia's growth.\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.22 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.23 a month ago based on 37 recommendations.\nOf the 39 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 33 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 84.62% and 7.69% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 83.78%, while Buy represented 8.11%.\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 37 analysts, the average price target for Nvidia comes to $664.12. The forecasts range from a low of $410.00 to a high of $1,100.00. The average price target represents an increase of 0.38% from the last closing price of $661.60.\nNVIDIA lacks on value. The stock has very high P/E and P/CF ratios. Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few NVIDIA-heavy ETFs so that investors can avoid company-specific concentration risks. After all, the semiconductor industry, as a whole, has a decent average brokerage recommendation.\nZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH \u2013 NVIDIA has 19.84% Focus\nAXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF WUGI \u2013 NVIDIA has 18.25% Exposure\nSimplify Volt RoboCar Disruption and Tech ETF VCAR \u2013 NVIDIA has 14.05% Exposure\nGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ \u2013 NVIDIA has 13.29% Exposure\nZacks Rank #2 Pacer Data and Digital Revolution ETF TRFK \u2013 NVIDIA has 13.09% Exposure\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Nvidia Could Be About to Counter a Big Artificial Intelligence (AI) Threat With This Move",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the dominant force in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) graphics cards, with an estimated 92% market share. This is the reason the company has been growing at a terrific pace, up 230% over the past year.\nHowever, the company faces a potential threat from some tech giants. Let's examine that threat before checking how Nvidia is reportedly going to take care of it.\nWhile companies including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet are Nvidia's customers and have spent billions of dollars on its graphics processing units (GPUs), it's no secret they have been developing custom AI chips to reduce their reliance on the graphics-card specialist.\nAlphabet, for instance, has deployed custom AI accelerators known as tensor processing units (TPUs) in Google Cloud to \"scale cost-efficiently for a wide range of AI workloads, spanning training, fine-tuning, and inference.\" Similarly, Meta Platforms is expected to deploy a new custom AI chip this year in a bid to reduce its dependence on Nvidia.\nMicrosoft has built custom AI chips for deployment in its Azure data centers, and they're expected to hit the market this year. Meanwhile, Amazon revealed its own chips for training AI models in November, making them available for use by Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud customers.\nThere are two reasons these tech giants have been developing chips in-house. First, Nvidia has been unable to keep up with the massive demand for its AI GPUs. The waiting period for the company's flagship H100 AI graphics card can reportedly stretch up to a year.\nNvidia is trying its best to increase the supply of its graphics cards with the help of its foundry partners, but customers may not be comfortable waiting for so long to get their hands on these chips.\nSecond, Nvidia's AI GPUs are very expensive. The H100 processor reportedly carries a price tag between $30,000 and $40,000. However, investment banking firm Raymond James estimates that it costs Nvidia just over $3,300 to manufacture one H100 GPU, pointing toward the immense pricing power the company enjoys in this market.\nSo it's not surprising to see tech giants looking to cut down on such massive spending by developing custom chips internally to tackle specific AI workloads for which an H100 may not be required.\nFormally known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), these custom chips are dedicated entirely to performing specific operations rapidly while being energy efficient. Semiconductor research group SemiAnalysis reportedly estimates that a successfully developed custom AI chip could help Nvidia's customers save hundreds of millions of dollars.\nAll this tells us why Nvidia may be looking to enter the custom AI chip market.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) are two leading manufacturers of ASICs, and both companies have witnessed a sharp jump in AI-related orders. Marvell, for instance, could generate $1 billion in revenue from selling custom AI chips this fiscal year. Broadcom, on the other hand, is expected to sell custom AI chips worth $8 billion to $9 billion in 2024, according to one estimate. These two companies together control a 47% share of the ASIC market.\nInvestment banking firm Needham estimates that the overall custom chip market was worth an estimated $30 billion last year. AI is already commanding a significant chunk of this space as sales of high-end custom ASICs reportedly stood between $13 billion and $18 billion last year. Morgan Stanley predicts that ASICs could account for 30% of the $182 billion AI chip market by 2027, pointing to a potential revenue opportunity of $55 billion in this space.\nA Feb. 9 Reuters exclusive says that a former Marvell executive is heading Nvidia's custom chip division, and the GPU specialist has already held discussions with Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Google to make custom chips for them.\nIf the Reuters report about Nvidia entering the custom AI chip space turns out to be true, investors will have another solid reason to buy this fast-growing AI stock. It's currently trading at an attractive 35 times forward earnings, a discount to its five-year average forward price-to-earnings ratio of 42.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Search for the phrase \"hot AI stocks\" using your favorite search engine, and you'll no doubt see Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) mentioned -- and for good reason. Shares of the giant chipmaker have skyrocketed close to 240% over the last 12 months.\nDemand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) is going through the roof. Companies around the world are scrambling to build AI applications, and the company's GPUs are the gold standard to power those apps.\nBut Nvidia is no longer just focused on chips. It now has a new $1 billion business.\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress stated during the fourth-quarter earnings conference call that the company's software and services business achieved an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. Nvidia AI Enterprise stands at the center of the company's software focus.\nCEO Jensen Huang described Nvidia AI Enterprise as \"an operating system for artificial intelligence.\" He emphasized, \"Software is fundamentally necessary for accelerated computing.\"\nNvidia's customer base includes quite a few huge technology companies with large software development teams. Why would they depend on Nvidia for software instead of building their own?\nHuang said that despite these customers' scale, they still don't have the resources needed to handle the complexity involved with maintaining and fine-tuning their software stacks across all of their AI applications. He added that Nvidia will do it for them.\nHuang isn't exaggerating. Nvidia AI Enterprise serves as the software layer for the company's DGX Cloud AI supercomputing service. DGX Cloud customers include Amazon's AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud.\nNvidia is still only in the early innings of building its software business. Huang said in the Q4 call, \"We're off to a great start.\" He added, \"[W]e're really just getting started.\"\nHe believes that software will be a much larger business for Nvidia over time. But just how big might Nvidia's software business grow?\nHuang said his \"guess is that every enterprise in the world, every software enterprise company that are [sic] deploying software in all the clouds and private clouds and on-prem [on-premises], will run on Nvidia AI Enterprise, especially obviously for our GPUs.\" With Nvidia charging $4,500 per GPU per year for AI Enterprise, that would translate to a massive amount of recurring revenue.\nI'm not sure if that grand vision will be achieved. However, I have no doubt whatsoever that software and services revenue of $1 billion is only the tip of the iceberg.\nThis huge software opportunity isn't the main reason to consider investing in Nvidia, though. Software will likely continue to be the icing on the cake for the company's chip business, which accounted for most of Nvidia's nearly $61 billion in revenue last year.\nThe company's chip business should still have significant growth potential. Huang identified two key growth drivers for Nvidia that should extend into 2025 and beyond.\nOne is the ongoing transition from general computing to accelerated computing. He believes that the energy efficiency and speed offered by accelerated computing will entice organizations to convert all of their data centers over time.\nThe other major tailwind is generative AI. Companies in nearly every industry are building generative AI apps. Huang said that Nvidia has seen generative AI become \"a whole new way of doing computing\" that's driving the company's growth in a big way.\nWith these key trends plus a booming software business, Nvidia just might remain on the list of hot AI stocks for a long time to come.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia shatters stock market record by adding over $230 billion in value in one day. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s dominating the AI chip race",
        "Author": "  Dylan Sloan ",
        "Text": "Chip designer Nvidia has emerged as the clear winner in not just the early stages of the AI boom but, at least so far, in all of stock market history. The $1.9 trillion AI giant surged to a record-high stock price on Thursday, putting it on course to add over $230 billion to its market capitalization and shatter a one-day record only weeks old: Meta\u2019s $197 billion gain in early February.\nIt\u2019s dominating the market, selling over 70% of all AI chips, and startups are desperate to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on Nvidia\u2019s hardware systems. Wall Street can\u2019t get enough, either\u2014Nvidia stock rocketed up an astonishing 15% after the company smashed its lofty earnings goals last quarter, bringing its market cap to over $1.9 trillion on top of its stock value tripling in the past year alone.\nSo \u2026 why? How is it that a company founded all the way back in 1993 has displaced tech titans Alphabet and Amazon, leapfrogging them to become the third-most valuable company in the world? It all comes down to Nvidia\u2019s leading semiconductor chips for use in artificial intelligence.\nNvidia built up its advantage by playing the long game and investing in AI years before ChatGPT hit the market, and its chip designs are so far ahead of the competition that analysts wonder if it\u2019s even possible for anyone else to catch up. Designers such as Arm Holdings and Intel, for instance, haven\u2019t yet integrated hardware with AI-targeted software in the way Nvidia has.\n\u201cThis is one of the great observations that we made: We realized that deep learning and AI was not [just] a chip problem \u2026 Every aspect of computing has fundamentally changed,\u201d said Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang at the New York Times DealBook Summit in November. \u201cWe observed and realized that about a decade and a half ago. I think a lot of people are still trying to sort that out.\u201d Huang added that Nvidia just \u201cgot it\u201d before anyone else did: \u201cThe reason why people say we\u2019re practically the only company doing it is because we\u2019re probably the only company that got it. And people are still trying to get it.\u201d\nSoftware has been a key part of that equation. While competitors have focused their efforts on chip design, Nvidia has aggressively pushed its CUDA programming interface that runs on top of its chips. That dual emphasis on software and hardware has made Nvidia chips the must-have tool for any developer looking to get into AI.\n\u201cNvidia has done just a masterful job of making it easier to run on CUDA than to run on anything else,\u201d said Edward Wilford, an analyst at tech consultancy Omdia. \u201cCUDA is hands down the jewel in Nvidia\u2019s crown. It\u2019s the thing that\u2019s gotten them this far. And I think it\u2019s going to carry them for a while longer.\u201d\nAI needs computing power\u2014a lot of computing power. AI chatbots such as ChatGPT are trained by inhaling vast quantities of data sourced from the internet\u2014up to a trillion distinct pieces of information. That data is fed into a neural network that catalogs the associations between various words and phrases, which, after human training, can be used to produce responses to user queries in natural language. All those trillions of data points require huge amounts of hardware capacity, and hardware demand is only expected to increase as the AI field continues to grow. That\u2019s put Nvidia, the sector\u2019s biggest seller, in a great position to benefit.\nHuang sounded a similar tune on his triumphant earnings call on Wednesday. Highlighting the shift from general-purpose computing to what he called \u201caccelerated computing\u201d at data centers, he argued that it\u2019s \u201ca whole new way of doing computing\u201d\u2014and even crowned it \u201ca whole new industry.\u201d\nNvidia has been at the forefront of AI hardware from the start. When large-scale AI research from startups such as OpenAI started ramping up in the mid-2010s, Nvidia\u2014through a mixture of luck and smart bets\u2014was in the right place at the right time.\nNvidia had long been known for its innovative GPUs, a type of chip popular in gaming applications. Most standard computer chips, called CPUs, excel at performing complicated calculations in sequence, one at a time. But GPUs can perform many simple calculations at once, making them excellent at supporting the complex graphics processing that video games demand. As it turned out, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs were a perfect fit for the type of computing systems AI developers needed to build and train LLMs.\n\u201cTo some extent, you could say they\u2019ve been extremely lucky. But I think that diminishes it\u2014they have capitalized perfectly on every instance of luck, on every opportunity they were given,\u201d said Wilford. \u201cIf you go back five or 10 years, you see this ramp-up in console gaming. They rode that, and then when they felt that wave cresting, they got into cryptocurrency mining, and they rode that. And then just as that wave crested, AI started to take off.\u201d\nIn fact, Nvidia had been quietly developing AI-targeted hardware for years. As far back as 2012, Nvidia chips were the technical foundation of AlexNet, the groundbreaking early neural network developed in part by OpenAI cofounder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who recently left the nonprofit after trying to oust CEO Sam Altman. That first mover advantage has given Nvidia a big leg up over its competitors.\n\u201cThey were visionaries \u2026 For Jensen, that goes back to his days at Stanford,\u201d said Wilford. \u201cHe\u2019s been waiting for this opportunity the whole time. And he\u2019s kept Nvidia in a position to jump on it whenever the chance came. What we\u2019ve seen in the last few years is that strategy executed to perfection. I can\u2019t imagine someone doing better with it than Nvidia has.\u201d\nSince its early AI investments over a decade ago, Nvidia has poured millions into a hugely profitable AI hardware business. The company sells its flagship Hopper GPU for a quarter of a million dollars per unit. It\u2019s a 70-pound supercomputer, built from 35,000 individual pieces\u2014and the waiting list for customers to get their hands on one is months long. Desperate AI developers are turning to organizations like the San Francisco Compute Group, which rents out computing power by the hour from its collection of Nvidia chips. (As of this article\u2019s publication, they\u2019re booked out for almost a month.)\nNvidia\u2019s AI chip juggernaut is poised to grow even more if AI growth meets analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\u201cNvidia delivered against what was seemingly a very high bar,\u201d wrote Goldman Sachs in its Nvidia earnings analysis. \u201cWe expect not only sustained growth in gen AI infrastructure spending by the large CSPs [communications service providers] and consumer internet companies, but also increased development and adoption of AI across enterprise customers representing various industry verticals and, increasingly, sovereign states.\u201d\nThere are some potential threats to Nvidia\u2019s market domination. For one, investors noted in the company\u2019s most recent earnings that restrictions on exports to China dinged business, and a potential increase in competition from Chinese chip designers could put pressure on Nvidia\u2019s global market share. Nvidia is also dependent on Taiwanese chip foundry TSMC to actually manufacture many of the chips it designs. The Biden administration has been pushing for more investment in domestic manufacturing through the CHIPS Act, but Huang himself said it will be at least a decade before American foundries could be fully operational.\n\u201c[Nvidia is] highly dependent on TSMC in Taiwan, and there are regional complications [associated with that], there are political complications,\u201d said Wilford. \u201c[And] the Chinese government is investing very heavily in developing their own AI capabilities as a result of some of those same tensions.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Ian King ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. rose the most in about nine months after the chipmaker delivered another eye-popping sales forecast, adding fresh momentum to a stock rally that already made it the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBYD\u2019s New $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, Lamborghini\nStock Rally Stalls at Start of Data-Packed Week: Markets Wrap\nFreddie Mercury\u2019s London Residence Lists at \u00a330 Million\nJacob Rothschild, Financier and Philanthropist, Dies at 87\nPoland\u2019s Famously Frank Top Diplomat Lands a Blow With Rebuff of Russia\nRevenue in the current period will be about $24 billion, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Analysts had predicted $21.9 billion on average. Results in the fourth quarter also sailed past Wall Street estimates.\nThe outlook extends a streak of Nvidia shattering expectations, thanks to insatiable demand for its artificial intelligence accelerators \u2014 highly prized chips that crunch data for AI models. The technology has helped power a proliferation of chatbots and other generative AI services, which can create text and graphics based on simple prompts.\n\u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in the statement. \u201cDemand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\u201d\nThe shares jumped 16% to $785.38 as the close Thursday in New York, a record high and the biggest single-day increase since May.\nNvidia\u2019s market capitalization has now increased by more than $650 billion this year \u2014 bringing its valuation to $1.89 trillion \u2014 as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.\nThat turned Wednesday\u2019s report into a highly anticipated event for both Wall Street and the tech world. And the numbers \u2014 along with the upbeat tone from Huang \u2014 renewed confidence that spending will stay strong.\nShares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. \u2014 three other chipmakers expected to benefit from AI growth \u2014 also gained on Thursday.\n\u201cThe entire market is watching this report and expectations have been elevated,\u201d Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso said in a note. Guidance was strong enough to \u201cdemonstrate continued momentum, while also leaving room for continued upside through the second half.\u201d\nNew Cycle\nOn a conference call with analysts, Huang said that demand for Nvidia\u2019s newest products will continue to outstrip supply for the rest of the year. Though supply is growing, demand isn\u2019t showing any signs of slowing, he said.\n\u201cGenerative AI has kicked off a whole new investment cycle,\u201d Huang said. That will lead to a doubling of the world\u2019s data center installed base over the next five years and \u201crepresent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions,\u201d he said.\nNvidia, co-founded by Huang in 1993, got its start as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. Its profile blew up in the last two years, when its technology proved adept at handling heavy AI workloads. The company\u2019s H100 accelerators have become legendary in the tech world, with customers scrambling to get their hands on as many as possible.\nCompanies such as Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google are Nvidia\u2019s largest customers, accounting for nearly 40% of its revenue, as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Jan 28, Nvidia\u2019s revenue more than tripled to $22.1 billion. Profit excluding certain items was $5.16 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $20.4 billion and earnings of $4.60 a share. Underscoring the magnitude of its recent growth streak: As recently as 2021, Nvidia didn\u2019t generate that much revenue in an entire year.\nNvidia\u2019s data center division, now by far its largest source of sales, generated $18.4 billion of revenue, up 409% from the same period a year earlier. Gaming chips provided $2.87 billion of sales.\nNvidia is now working to spread its AI technology beyond the big data-center companies. Huang, 61, has traveled the globe arguing that governments and corporations need their own AI systems \u2014 both to protect their data and gain a competitive advantage.\nNvidia announced a deal with Cisco Systems Inc. earlier this month that gives it a new distribution channel. As part of that deal, Cisco, the world\u2019s biggest provider of networking gear, will help sell complete AI systems to companies.\nRead More: Nvidia, Cisco to Help Companies Build In-House AI Computing\nBut Nvidia faces risks, including mounting competition and a push by some customers to develop their own AI chips.\nAMD recently began selling a line of accelerators called the MI300. It expects to get revenue of $3.5 billion from that product this year, up from an earlier projection of $2 billion. Nvidia isn\u2019t standing still, though. Analysts expect the company to soon unveil more powerful accelerators.\nNvidia also has had to navigate new export rules for chips headed to China, the largest market for semiconductors. The company has scaled down the capabilities of its products in order to continue to sell to that region, which in the past has accounted for a quarter of revenue. Three months ago, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told analysts that the company\u2019s projections would have been higher if it weren\u2019t for the China rules.\nIn terms of data center revenue, China accounted for a mid-single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter. \u201cWe expect it to stay in a similar range in the first quarter,\u201d Kress said Wednesday.\nThe company has begun sending samples of new chips that are compliant with restrictions to Chinese customers, Huang said.

        "Text": "Quarterly Revenue: Reached a record $22.1 billion, a 22% increase from Q3 and a 265% surge from the previous year.\nData Center Revenue: Achieved a record $18.4 billion for the quarter, marking a 27% rise from Q3 and a staggering 409% year-over-year growth.\nAnnual Financials: Full-year revenue soared by 126% to $60.9 billion, with GAAP EPS up 586% and non-GAAP EPS up 288% from the previous year.\nGross Margin: Improved to 76.0% in Q4 from 74.0% in Q3, and up significantly from 63.3% the previous year.\nNet Income: Q4 net income jumped to $12.3 billion, a 33% increase from Q3 and a 769% increase year-over-year.\nEarnings Per Share: GAAP diluted EPS for Q4 was $4.93, up 33% from Q3 and up 765% from the previous year.\nDividend: Announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share, payable on March 27, 2024.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nOn February 21, 2024, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) released its 8-K filing, revealing a record-breaking performance for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2024. The company, a leading developer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, has seen its products and services become increasingly vital in a variety of sectors, including gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNVIDIA's remarkable quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion represents a 22% increase from the third quarter and a 265% increase from the same period last year. This growth was propelled by a record quarterly Data Center revenue of $18.4 billion, which is up 27% from Q3 and up 409% from the previous year. The company's full-year revenue also saw a significant uptick, reaching $60.9 billion, a 126% increase from the previous fiscal year.\nThe company's gross margin improved notably, reaching 76.0% in the fourth quarter, up from 74.0% in the third quarter and 63.3% from the previous year. This expansion in gross margin underscores NVIDIA's ability to not only increase sales but also to do so profitably, a key indicator of financial health for value investors.\nOperating income for Q4 stood at $13.6 billion, a 31% increase from Q3 and a significant 983% increase year-over-year. Net income saw a similar trajectory, with Q4 net income reaching $12.3 billion, up 33% from the previous quarter and up 769% from the same quarter last year. The GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter was $4.93, which is a 33% increase from the previous quarter and a 765% increase from the previous year. The non-GAAP diluted EPS was even higher at $5.16, marking a 28% increase from Q3 and a 486% increase year-over-year.\nThese earnings figures are particularly important for NVIDIA, a company at the forefront of the semiconductor industry, as they reflect the successful adoption of its AI and GPU technologies across various sectors. The substantial increase in EPS indicates robust profitability and may signal strong future potential for the company.\nDespite the impressive financial achievements, NVIDIA faces challenges inherent in the fast-paced and competitive semiconductor industry. Rapid technological advancements and intense competition require continuous innovation and investment in research and development. Additionally, the company's forward-looking statements suggest a focus on new product cycles and innovations, which are crucial for maintaining its market-leading position.\nNVIDIA's outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 anticipates revenue to be around $24.0 billion, with GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins expected to be approximately 76.3% and 77.0%, respectively. Operating expenses are projected to be around $3.5 billion on a GAAP basis and $2.5 billion on a non-GAAP basis.\nNVIDIA's record-breaking earnings report for Q4 and fiscal 2024 highlights the company's strong position in the semiconductor industry, driven by its innovative AI and GPU technologies. With significant year-over-year growth in revenue, net income, and EPS, NVIDIA demonstrates its ability to capitalize on the growing demand for accelerated computing and AI. As the company continues to innovate and expand its product offerings, investors will be watching closely to see how it navigates the challenges ahead and capitalizes on the opportunities presented by the evolving tech landscape.\nFor a detailed analysis of NVIDIA's financial performance and future prospects, investors are encouraged to review the full earnings report and accompanying commentary by NVIDIA's executive vice president and chief financial officer, Colette Kress, available on the company's investor relations website.\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from NVIDIA Corp for further details.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": " Brian Sozzi    \u00b7 Executive Editor",
        "Text": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\nThe chart of the day\nWhat we're watching\nWhat we're reading\nEconomic data releases and earnings\nGetting old sucks, and I don't like it one bit.\nMy hair is thinning. I don't wake up at 1:45 a.m. each day with the same fiery energy to obsess over markets and stocks. I am down to eating red meat three times a month \"just because\" it's what people have told me is the right thing to do at this point in life.\nFrom what I can tell, one of the only positives of getting old is experience.\nAnd my experience in analyzing and reporting on markets and leaders for more than a decade tells me that investors have become fully engulfed in an AI-fueled tech bubble.\nTo be fair, this feels like a much different bubble than the cannabis and crypto stock bubbles of years gone by, as tech giants like Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) have real money-minting business models. Their leaders also aren't inexperienced dopes (see the cryptosphere's bad actors of the last two years).\nBut make no mistake: We are in a bubble, and it could end badly at some point.\nHere are some of the elements I see to support this view.\nNvidia shares ripped 15% higher last Thursday after earnings. The report sent the broader market ripping higher too.\nNvidia rivals AMD (AMD) and Arm (ARM) saw strong bids. New hot Yahoo Finance ticker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) exploded by 36%. Even Intel (INTC) caught some Nvidia tailwinds. And shares of Meta (META), which has been out in front in buying Nvidia chips, shot higher as well.\nDoesn't this all look insane and feel akin to blind buying by FOMO traders?\nIn a normal functioning market, Nvidia doing amazingly is bad news for competitors such as AMD and Intel. Nvidia is selling more of its chips, meaning fewer sales opportunities for rivals. Shouldn't their stocks drop?\nJust because Meta owns and uses some new Nvidia chips, how is that going to positively impact its earnings and cash flow over the next four quarters? Will it at all?\nThe point is that investors are acting irrationally as Nvidia serves up eye-popping financial figures and the hype machine descends on social media. It makes sense until it doesn't, and that is classic bubble action.\nStill not convinced this is an AI-fueled tech bubble?\nThen cast your eyes on the typical Wall Street action of justifying ever-higher valuation multiples on stocks.\n\"At 29x our calendar year 2024 estimated [earnings per share], Nvidia trades at a lower multiple vs. peers Intel and AMD,\" one analyst wrote in a note following the Nvidia earnings stampede. \"We view the valuation as compelling. Nvidia remains a top pick.\"\nI am not saying Nvidia shouldn't be valued at a premium to the market \u2014 not saying that at all, so don't shred me via email.\nWhat I am asking you to do is to deconstruct the above commentary, which is creeping more and more into tech coverage.\nThe analyst, in this case, has rationalized that 1) high price multiples for slower growers Intel and AMD are OK because AI is so hot, or so it seems, and 2) Nvidia's stock deserves to trade at about a 33% premium to an already rich P/E multiple on the S&P 500.\nNvidia's valuation isn't mind-blowingly compelling considering earnings estimates have been jacked up to the ceiling! This is a priced-for-absolute-perfection tech stock.\nBut hey, inside a tech bubble, anything goes, right?\nNothing says \"investing bubble\" like unbridled confidence. It's that feeling that whatever stock you buy \u2014 at whatever price and at whatever time \u2014 will only go up forever. This makes you feel like an investing genius and inclined to take on more risk.\nHere's a dose of insight that shows a ton of overconfidence sweeping through markets.\nTraders\u2019 confidence in their own decision making, consistent with bullishness, just hit the highest level since Charles Schwab began its Trader Sentiment survey, the financial services firm said this week. From a sector perspective, traders are most bullish on information technology (shocker). They are very upbeat on AI stocks in particular (shocker).\nNews flash: You aren't an investing genius. The best thing you can do right now to grow your wealth is realize it's time to lay the groundwork to begin protecting your wealth that has been created by the tech bubble.\nLean on your investing experience and all its wrinkles.\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "Title": "Customer demand for Nvidia chips is so far above supply that CEO Jensen Huang had to discuss how \u2018fairly\u2019 the company decides who can buy them",
        "Author": "  Kylie Robison ",
        "Text": "With demand for his company's AI chips soaring and supply limited, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was forced to deliver an unusual message Wednesday.\n\"We allocate fairly. We do the best we can to allocate fairly, and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,\" Huang said in response to a question during Nvidia's fourth quarter earnings call.\nThe Nvidia boss was referring to how the company decides who gets first dibs on its graphics processors, or GPUs, the hardware that powers the artificial intelligence boom. Tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet can't get enough of Nvidia's GPUs as they race to build datacenters that make popular generative AI services like ChatGPT, Runway AI and Gemini a reality.\nAnd that's just one group of customers. A long list of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs) are also clamoring for the GPUs, not to mention customers in industries like biology, healthcare, finance, AI development, and robotics.\nHaving to choose between desperate customers might seem like a good problem to have. Indeed, Nvidia's $22 billion in fourth quarter revenue was more than triple what it was a year ago and came in $2 billion above the company's own forecast.\n\u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,\u201d Huang said in a statement accompanying the results, which sent Nvidia's stock up more than 8% in after hours trading.\nBut managing that demand is no simple feat, and in the chip business, getting it wrong can have disastrous consequences on the balance sheet. So Huang needs customers to trust that Nvidia isn't playing favorites, lest they order more than they actually need or consider alternatives such as AMD's forthcoming AI chips.\nIn trying to assure listeners of Nvidia's even-handedness, Huang explained how the company works strategically with cloud service providers\u2014which account for 40% of Nvidia's datacenter business\u2014to ensure that they can responsible plan for their needs.\n\"Our CSPs have a very clear view of our product roadmap and transitions,\" Huang said. \"And that transparency with our CSPs gives them the confidence of which products to place, and where, and when... they know the timing to the best of our ability, and they know quantities and of course allocation.\"\nThe attention that Nvidia's earnings report commanded on Wednesday cannot be overstated. Across social media platforms, vivid artificially-generated images depict cityscapes in disarray, with towering structures engulfed in flames, each captioned with various ways of saying\u2014a failure by Nvidia to meet earnings expectations could have profound implications for the world at large.\n\"If Nvidia doesn\u2019t beat earnings expectations today the earth will explode,\" one financial advisor joked in a tweet.\nIn the era of burgeoning artificial intelligence and heightened corporate demand for its capabilities, Nvidia has emerged as a pivotal player. Its significance is underscored by the fact that it commands over 80% of the worldwide market for the specialized chips essential for powering AI applications, according to Reuters. This week, Nvidia's market cap surged to $1.8 trillion, propelling it to the position of the fourth-largest company globally by market capitalization, surpassing both Amazon and Alphabet in the process.\nWhen it comes to GPU supply, Huang said the issue is more complex than it might seem. While he commended the supply chain for providing Nvidia with necessary components like packaging, memory, and various other parts, he underscored the substantial size of the GPUs themselves.\n\"People think that Nvidia GPUs is like a chip. But the Nvidia Hopper GPU is 35,000 parts. It weighs 70 pounds,\" Huang said. \"These things are really complicated...people call it an AI supercomputer for good reason. If you ever looking look in the back of the data center, the systems, the cabling system is mind boggling. It is the most dense, complex cabling system for networking the world's ever seen.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) did it again. For the third straight quarterly period, the company blew past management's own revenue guidance by more than $2 billion. The technology company is the clear leader in advancing the many uses of artificial intelligence (AI).\nFor Nvidia's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ended Jan. 28, the company reported sales of $22.1 billion. That's an increase of 265% versus the year ago period, and well above the prior guidance of $20 billion.\nThis one chart pretty much tells the whole story:\nLast year marked an explosion in sales for the data center segment that includes advanced AI chips. Three of Nvidia's four business segments increased revenue year over year in its fourth quarter, with automotive being the only laggard. But the data center segment is the focus right now. Data center revenue was more than 400% higher than the prior year period.\nThe company believes that escalation will continue as management believes total sales will be about $24 billion in the current quarter. These are also high margin products. In its full fiscal year 2024, gross profit margin expanded to almost 73% compared to just 57% in fiscal 2023. That's expected to continue to rise to more than 76% in the current fiscal 2025 first quarter.\nOf course investors have noticed these astounding numbers and Nvidia stock has rocketed higher along with its sales and earnings.\nWhile there will likely be ups and downs in the stock, it still doesn't look overly expensive. That's because of the still-accelerating growth. While a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 32 is pricey by traditional standards, that metric could decrease quickly as earnings expand.\nAnd the company still has potential for other areas to balloon. The previously mentioned automotive segment could grow quickly if self-driving vehicles become more mainstream. That's just one more reason to ensure Nvidia has a place in the growth stock portion of any portfolio.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Todd Campbell ",
        "Text": "The widespread investment in artificial intelligence has been a boon to Nvidia shareholders. The company's share price has surged over the past year as optimism over increased spending on AI infrastructure has swelled, resulting in outsized gains that have left many wondering what could happen next.\nWhile the rapid run-up in Nvidia's stock -- a meteoric 400% since 2022 -- has left jaws dropping, it hasn't caught everyone by surprise. Real Money Pro's Bruce Kamich accurately predicted last March that \"investors should look for additional gains,\" and more recently, he outlined the possibility that shares could one day reach $726.\nNvidia hasn't quite reached Kamich's upside target, but given shares have eclipsed $700, he recently revisited his analysis, resulting in a new price target.\nWu Jun/VCG via Getty Images\nThe potential for artificial intelligence has been discussed for decades. In the 1950s, mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing researched designing AI computers, and the Rand Corporation created the first AI program in 1956. Over the years, many science fiction books and movies have entertained the possibility that machines could one day think for themselves.\nAlthough the concept of AI isn't new, it wasn't until recently that AI truly went mainstream. ChatGPT, a large-language AI model, became the fastest application to reach one million users after its launch in December 2022.\nRelated: Analyst updates AMD stock price target after fourth-quarter earnings\nChatGPT's success caused a flurry of investment in similar generative AI applications designed to search, parse, and create content from large data sets. Microsoft quickly inked a deal to include ChatGPT in its Bing search engine, prompting Alphabet's Google to respond with its own AI application, Bard.\nThe influx of AI investment hasn't been limited to search, though. The military is researching AI's use on the battlefield, financial companies like JP Morgan Chase are using it to hedge portfolio risks, healthcare companies are examining its potential in drug development, and retailers are considering whether AI can crimp theft.\nThe potential application of AI across most industries and business practices has caused a surge in spending on the infrastructure necessary to train and operate AI solutions.\nThat's been a big boon for Nvidia\u00a0 (NVDA) , given its software and graphic processing units, or GPUs, are much better suited to handle AI's heavy workloads than the traditional central processing units, or CPUs, deployed in most enterprise and cloud networks.\nThe need to update networks to handle AI demand has caused Nvidia's sales and profit to skyrocket. Demand for Nvidia's AI chips, including the A100 and H200, led to sales surging 206% to $18.1 billion in the third quarter.\nThe significant increase in revenue, leveraged against fixed costs, translated into similarly substantial earnings. Nvidia's profit per share totaled $4.02 in Q3, up a whopping 593% from the same quarter in the previous year.\nThe market for Nvidia's AI chips is global.\nFor example, China represents over 20% of its data center sales. Unfortunately, that's a problem because the U.S. government is increasingly concerned that China and other foreign powers may buy high-end technology to develop AI applications that could one day be used against it.\nMore AI Stocks:\nAI wave takes this stock to record highs as investors look beyond Mag 7\nAI stock soars on new guidance (it's not Nvidia!)\nBig tech stocks are doubling down on AI\nTo limit the risk, the Department of Commerce announced restrictions on sales of high-performance chips to China last year. The worry that Nvidia wouldn't be able to develop an alternative that meets the government's mandates is a major reason why Nvidia's shares fell more than 17% last fall.\nThat's not the only challenge Nvidia is navigating. It's also facing new competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0 (AMD) .\nLast year, AMD CEO Lisa Su announced plans to develop its own AI chips to challenge Nvidia's lead. Its MI300 chips started shipping this year, and demand appears robust.\nDuring AMD's fourth-quarter conference call in January, Su predicted the AI-GPU market would grow by an average of 73% annually to $400 billion through 2027. She also said AMD expected to sell $3.5 billion worth of GPUs to data centers this year, up from a previous forecast of $2 billion.\nNvidia's CEO Jensen Huang is taking AMD's threat seriously. His team is developing its own next-gen AI chips to maintain Nvidia's leadership in the AI market. In January, they unveiled AI chips for PCs that can enhance gaming and provide AI on the device rather than requiring users to connect to the cloud. Nvidia also said it plans to ship a chip to China that meets government regulations in the second quarter.\nNvidia's stock price has surged higher this year ahead of these new chips and the release of its fourth-quarter financial results on Feb. 21.\nLast month, Kamich was skeptical about Nvidia's risk-to-reward despite calculating a $726 price target. Nvidia handily overcame that skepticism, and while it hasn't yet reached Kamich's target, its shares are trading above $700, leading Kamich to reevaluate his analysis, including his price targets.\nKamich, a\u00a0technical analyst, has studied price and volume trends for insight into the sentiment of investors for 50 years. His latest take on Nvidia remains mixed, with concerns Nvidia shares may have run too far, too fast, despite a new higher price target that could still mean that shares rally.\n\"Shares are trading above the rising 50-day moving average line and are extended (overbought) above the rising 200-day moving average line,\" says Kamich. \"NVDA is extended above the rising 40-week moving average line. Trading volume has been shrinking the past five months, and that is a negative.\"\nKamich notes that while the stock may be overbought, point-and-figure charts reveal yet another upside target. Specifically, using a daily P&F chart, Kamich calculated a Nvidia stock price target of $757.\nThat target is alluring, but investors should remember that\u00a0P&F targets aren't guaranteed and don't specify timing. Given that shares are extended, it wouldn't be too surprising if they pull back at some point to digest some of their gains.\nOf course, there's no telling when that may happen. Nvidia's upcoming earnings results are anticipated to reveal another solid showing, but the overhang of China restrictions last quarter remains a wildcard.\nOverall, analysts expect Nvidia to deliver revenue of $18.8 billion, up a staggering 211% from one year ago, and earnings of $4.20 per share, up from just $0.88 in Q4 2022.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n"

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Nvidia's shares scaled a new peak on Monday after Goldman Sachs raised its price target for the high-flying chipmaker's stock in anticipation of a major boost to its earnings from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\nThe stock rose about 4% to $689.21 and looked set to add about $70 billion to the company's market capitalization. Nvidia was valued at $1.63 trillion as of Friday's close.\nNvidia has emerged as a poster child of the AI frenzy and saw a record monthly jump in its market value in January.\nThe searing growth in the stock price - already up about 39% so far this year - has made it more expensive to own relative to its peers. Nvidia's shares trade at 31.4 times the company's forward earnings estimate, compared with the industry average of 22.9.\nStill, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari sees more room for growth.\n\"We believe Nvidia will remain as the industry gold standard for the foreseeable future, given its robust hardware and software offerings and, importantly, the pace at which it continues to innovate,\" Hari said.\nGoldman Sachs analysts raised their price target for Nvidia to $800, the third highest among U.S. analysts covering the stock and indicating a 21% upside from current levels, according to LSEG data. Its previous price target was $625.\nThe bank also lifted its full-year 2025-2026 earnings estimates for Nvidia by 22% on an average, citing signs of robust AI server demand and improving graphics processing unit (GPU) supply.\nHari pointed to signs of AI monetization from companies including Microsoft and Meta Platforms as well as positive earnings outlook from AI server maker Super Micro Computer.\nWhile Nvidia has unlocked billions in revenue on the back of the AI frenzy, other chipmakers that are not so deeply involved in making chips for AI, such as Intel, have seen their shares lag.\nNvidia is set to report results on Feb. 21, with analysts expecting fourth-quarter earnings per share of $4.51 and revenue of $20.19 billion, according to LSEG data.\n(Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Shweta Agarwal)\n"

        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock surged 16% to a new all-time high on Feb. 22 after the chipmaker's latest earnings report crushed Wall Street's expectations. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on Jan. 28, its revenue surged 265% year over year to $22.1 billion and surpassed analysts' expectations by $1.6 billion. Its adjusted earnings soared 486% to $5.16 per share and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.52.\nFor the full year, Nvidia's revenue jumped 126% to $60.9 billion as its adjusted EPS climbed 288%. That represented a stunning acceleration from its flat revenue growth and 25% decline in adjusted earnings in fiscal 2023.\nNvidia's 280% rally over the past 12 months has propelled its market cap to $1.96 trillion, making it the world's third-most-valuable company after Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), which is worth $3.06 trillion, and Apple, which is worth $2.85 trillion. So does Nvidia have a realistic shot at surpassing Apple and stealing the crown from Microsoft by 2025?\nNvidia's recent growth spurt was entirely driven by the explosive growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Nvidia's top-tier data center GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks more efficiently than stand-alone CPUs, and companies scrambled to purchase those chips to keep pace with the growth of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nAll of the world's leading AI-oriented companies -- including OpenAI, its top backer Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet's Google, and Meta Platforms -- use Nvidia's GPUs. Its GPU sales to China were throttled by export curbs over the past year, but the market's demand is still outstripping its supply by a significant margin.\nNvidia generated 78% of its revenue from its data center chips in fiscal 2024, compared to just 56% of its revenue in fiscal 2023. That rapid expansion curbed its dependence on gaming GPUs, which previously generated most of its revenue but were highly exposed to the PC market's post-pandemic slowdown and the volatile crypto mining market.\nThe bulls believe Nvidia will continue to dominate the AI market, even as its rival AMD enters the ring with its cheaper data center GPUs, and cloud giants like Meta and Google start developing their own first-party AI GPUs. Based on those rosy expectations, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 as its EPS rises at a CAGR of 37%.\nNvidia's stock isn't cheap at 35 times forward earnings and 18 times this year's sales, but it seems reasonably valued relative to its growth rates. If it maintains those valuations, meets analysts' expectations, and still trades at 35 times forward earnings by the beginning of fiscal 2027 (which starts in Jan. 2026), its stock might be worth $1,085 per share with a market cap of about $2.7 trillion by late 2025. That would represent a near-40% gain from its current levels.\nWe should take those hazy long-term estimates with a grain of salt, since Nvidia repeatedly beat analysts' expectations over the past year, but they imply the chipmaker probably won't be more valuable than Microsoft by 2025.\nMicrosoft has also tapped into the AI market's explosive growth via its big investment in OpenAI and the integration of its generative AI tools into its own cloud-based services. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise at a CAGR of 15% and 17%, respectively, from fiscal 2023 (which ended last June) to fiscal 2026.\nLike Nvidia, Microsoft also trades at 35 times forward earnings. If it maintains that premium multiple and matches Wall Street's expectations, it could trade at about $550 with a market cap of $4.1 trillion by early 2026.\nSimply put, Nvidia won't catch up to Microsoft unless the bulls abruptly bid its valuations to unsustainable levels or Microsoft drops the ball and gets revalued as a slower-growth company.\nInstead of wondering if either of those scenarios will happen, investors should focus on Nvidia's growth potential instead of its market capitalization. It's still selling picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, and it could still have plenty of room to run before longer-term headwinds like AMD's GPUs or first-party chips meaningfully affect its growth.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia investors are on top of the world\u2014but to justify its $1.91 trillion market cap from here, the AI chip darling faces brutal math",
        "Author": "  Shawn Tully ",
        "Text": "On Feb. 22, 2024, Nvidia's stock performed one-day heroics probably never matched in the annals of capitalism. By 10 a.m., its shares had soared almost 15%, lifting its market capitalization to $1.91 trillion from $1.66 trillion at the previous close. The gain of $250 billion equals 40% the valuation for Tesla and 80% that of Oracle, and exceeds the worth of Intel by 20%. Nvidia is now the straw stirring the cocktail in the investment world. Its earnings beat, reported after the market close on Feb. 21, ignited a frenzy that sent the Nasdaq 100 soaring 3% by midafternoon on the 22nd.\nWall Street analysts cheered the results, with no fewer than 18 brokerages lifting their forecasts for gains beyond its current price of almost $800 by year-end. Goldman Sachs hiked to $875, while Bernstein raised to $1,000 and KeyBanc to $1,100.\nThe optimism is certainly understandable, given Nvidia's sorcerous results, and the widespread view that the AI domain it dominates will prove the transformative technology of the millennium. For FY 2024 (ended Jan. 31), Nvidia grew GAAP revenues by 126% to $61 billion, and raised net income almost sixfold, to $29.8 billion. Nvidia is exhibiting operating leverage on a scale probably never before witnessed, meaning that it is booking big earnings increases as a share of every dollar of new revenue. For example, the gross margin rise of 57% to 73% shows that Nvidia this year pocketed 30% more on each comparable unit shipped to customers over last year, based on the selling price versus what it paid to make or purchase the products and materials. It gets better. Its R&D, overhead and other operating costs, less special items, rose a piddling 11%, one-tenth the rate of increase in its sales.\nAnalysts point out that Nvidia's P/E multiple doesn't look outrageous. Prior to the jump on Thursday, it stood at 56 based on full FY 2024 earnings of $29.8 billion, and the Wall Street crowd used much lower numbers by citing forward estimates incorporating giant gains in the quarters to come. Overnight, the 15% jump in its share price raised Nvidia's multiple to 64. In the investment community, that substantial figure appears to scare almost no one.\nWhat should give pause is projections on what Nvidia will need to earn, say, a decade hence to be worth anything like its current cap of $1.91 trillion. In fact, it's interesting to examine just how much the historic one day leap has raised the bar. Let's say investors will want a 10% annual total return from Nvidia. After all, it's a risky stock. The options action prior to the earnings release underscored that investors were extremely nervous that even mildly disappointing results would hammer the stock, simply because of the great expectations built into the price.\nIt's especially interesting to compare the earnings Nvidia would have needed to generate when its market cap was $1.66 trillion in Wednesday compared to the requirements today, after adding $240 billion.\nSo let's start with what was required before the mega-bump, to reach returns of 10% a year. When Nvidia's cap was $1.66 trillion, it had to notch a valuation of $4.33 trillion by 2034 to reach our goal. Assuming that by then it's still growing pretty fast, but heading for maturity, we'll assume it boasts a better-than-average PE of 25. In that scenario, the profit needed to grab the prize is $173 billion 10 years hence. Getting there equates to 18.9% yearly growth in profits, on average, over that span.\nThat's one heck of a stretch. But on Thursday, the stretch got a lot more elastic. At the current $1.91 billion cap and our 25 assumption for a P/E, Nvidia must make not $173 billion, but $200 billion by 2034. That's well over twice the sub-$100 billion numbers Apple and Microsoft are showing today. Adjusted for 2.5% yearly inflation over the next decade, it's 50% more than Apple earned in the last four quarters. Hitting the $200 billion mark in 2034 requires annual increases of 21%, 2.1 points more than the 18.9% needed before the Thursday run-up.\nThat may not sound like a huge difference. But consider this: In 2034 over 2033, to add that annualized 21% in profits, Nvidia's net income would need to wax, in a single year, by $35 billion. That compares with an increase in that 10th year of $27 billion just a day ago, when its valuation was 15% lower at $1.66 trillion.\nPut simply, the problem isn't that 21% earnings growth, for the tech superstar of superstars, looks so daunting. It's that Nvidia already earns tons of money, and sells at a big multiple to those fat earnings. The cause for caution: The ultimate number Nvidia must achieve to give investors decent returns from here, and the multiple $15 or $20 and eventually $35 billion increases needed in the out years. Competitors will jump rush to capture a share of its sumptuous margins. Stiffer competition will cause prices and profitability to drop. The latest surge just made the adjustable mountain Nvidia must climb far steeper. No company has ever delivered such astounding results so quickly as Nvidia. And no company has ever had to scale such formidable heights to surmount the law of large numbers.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) rocketed higher on Thursday after the company reported Q4 earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street\u2019s lofty expectations, thanks to sky-high data center graphics chip sales.\nBut CEO Jensen Huang isn\u2019t just banking on selling AI chips to companies. He\u2019s also looking at selling to entire countries as part of a concept known as sovereign AI.\n\u201cThe language, the knowledge, the history, the culture of each region are different,\u201d Huang said during Nvidia\u2019s earnings call. \u201cAnd they own their own data. They would like to use their data, train it to create their own digital intelligence, and provision it to harness that raw material themselves.\u201d\nSovereign AI boils down to a single country or region setting up its own AI capabilities, allowing its AI to meet its own needs.\n\u201cIn regions outside of the US and China, sovereign AI has become an additional demand driver,\u201d said Nvidia CFO Colette Kress.\n\u201cCountries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of large language models in their own language on domestic data and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems,\u201d she added.\nAccording to Huang, Japan, Canada, France, and a number of other regions are already setting up their own sovereign AI systems.\nOf course, sovereign AI isn\u2019t the only thing driving Nvidia\u2019s sales. In fact, the company said that more than half of its Data Center sales, which accounted for $18.4 billion of the firm\u2019s $22.1 billion in overall revenue, came from large cloud providers.\nA number of those large cloud providers, however, are working on their own specialized AI chips that will prove more efficient in terms of performance and power compared to Nvidia\u2019s chips. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft already have or are developing their own chips as a means of weaning off of their dependence on Nvidia.\nBut Nvidia isn\u2019t taking the challenge lying down. According to Reuters, the company has reportedly reached out to the three cloud providers with the hopes of producing those custom chips for them.\nIt\u2019s not as though Nvidia is hurting at the moment, though. The chip giant raked in nearly as much revenue in Q4 as it did in all of last year: $27 billion. And it\u2019s expected to bring in even more next quarter, with guidance calling for revenue of $24 billion plus or minus 2%.\nAnd if it can sell to entire countries the way it\u2019s been selling to Big Tech companies, there\u2019s no telling how much higher Nvidia could go.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "$1.7 trillion chip giant Nvidia just gained over $100 billion in value after a blowout quarter, but this mega-bearish analyst says the tech industry is in an AI bubble",
        "Author": "  Paolo Confino ",
        "Text": "Investors have long had a love affair with U.S. tech stocks from the boom cycle of the late \u201890s and early 2000s that famously ended with the dotcom crash, to the AI-induced heights of Nvidia\u2019s current stock rally. Love affairs, though, often end badly, and this one could leave investors nursing both an aching wallet and a broken heart. Artificial intelligence has officially thrust the U.S. tech industry into a bubble and Silicon Valley could be on the precipice of another crash, according to an analyst note from BCA Research chief strategist Dhaval Joshi.\n\u201cWe are in an AI bubble,\u201d Joshi tells Fortune. \u201cWe've been wowed by some of the results.\u201d\nFew stocks embodied that wow factor like the $1.7 trillion AI chip giant Nvidia, which reported earnings on Wednesday, blowing analyst expectations out of the water. The chipmaker\u2014dubbed \u201cthe most important stock on planet earth,\u201d by a Goldman Sachs analyst\u2014reported revenues of $22.1 billion during the last quarter, compared to a forecast of $20.6 billion. Revenues for the company's data center chips, used in AI models and generative AI applications, reflected increased demand and reached $18.4 billion, up 27% from the third quarter and 409% compared to last year. Stock prices rose 7% in post-market trading, adding over $100 billion of value.\n\u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,\u201d said Nvidia founder and chief executive Jensen Huang in a press release. \u201cDemand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\u201d\nWhile Joshi didn\u2019t comment on Nvidia specifically, its outstanding results can be seen as evidence for his case.\nThe tech sector is trading at a 75% premium to the global stock market, according to Joshi\u2019s calculations in an analyst note published last week. Its scorching-hot growth became the backbone on which much of the rest of the U.S. stock market\u2019s growth was built and drove the Nasdaq to near record highs last year, just 6.5% off its all-time high in November 2021. In 2023, the so-called Magnificent Seven, which comprise Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla, contributed two thirds of the S&P 500\u2019s total market gains.\nAnd while those gains are impressive and remunerative for savvy investors, they\u2019re unsustainable, according to Joshi.\nUnlike Nvidia, some companies won\u2019t be able to live up to the lofty expectations the market sets. That could spell trouble because valuations and stock prices are often measured against expectations as much as they are actual results. If the major tech companies that make up much of the sector\u2019s (and the economy\u2019s) growth miss out on analyst expectations they could drag others down with them. While he cautions against underestimating AI as a whole, Joshi believes the market is pricing in far too much productivity growth from the new technology. And when new innovations fail to live up to those expectations the market will punish the companies that made them.\n\u201cBecause these handful of stocks have become such a massive percentage of the market cap, any disappointment there is mathematically going to have an impact on the overall index,\u201d Joshi says.\nIn order for the U.S. tech sector to avoid bubble territory, it would have to continue trading at a 10% premium to the market\u2014a scenario which Joshi sees as unlikely.\nJoshi doesn't blame the market for valuing tech companies so highly. In fact, they\u2019ve proven their worth over the last 10 years by achieving stellar results time and time again. In the last decade the stocks of premier tech firms have soared. For example, since February 2014 Nvidia\u2019s stock has risen 14,927%, Microsoft\u2019s 964%, and Apple\u2019s 875%. The numbers pale in comparison to the still-robust 163% the S&P 500 returned over the last 10 years. Even though he doesn\u2019t believe it will continue, he says it is rational for the market to keep pricing in more explosive growth in tech.\n\u201cIf you get very strong earnings growth, for one or two years, the market thinks of it the other way: \u2018This can\u2019t be sustained.\u2019 So if anything, you give it a low valuation, because you say these are abnormally high earnings. But if the market sees 10 years of outstanding performance it no longer considers those results abnormal, coming to expect them in perpetuity, Joshi says.\nFor Joshi, though, the last 10 years of blockbuster earnings growth were, in fact, abnormal. In large part because the bulk of that growth was a result of the network effect, which allowed a select few firms to balloon in size and effectively gain control of a market. Amazon captured the market for online shopping, Google did the same for search, and Meta cornered the market in online communication, Joshi writes in his note.\n\u201cOnce you have networks, you have winners and losers,\u201d he says. \u201cThose winners become natural monopolies, and if you're a natural monopoly, then you're in a very strong position to grow your profits.\u201d\nWithout a clear indication that the network effect will translate to the world of AI, those companies won\u2019t have the same dominant position, Joshi argues. \u201cThe market is saying, \u2018hey the baton is going to be passed on now to generative AI and that will continue the trend for the next five to 10 years.\u2019 I'm very cynical about that because there is no network effect in generative AI.\u201d\nThere is the possibility that some especially popular AI tools could see a network effect if they attract more users because they\u2019ll be able to train themselves on all the tasks they get asked to perform.\nEven without AI it seems like the benefits of the network effect could be reduced in the near future because of a push from elected officials to regulate Big Tech. \u201cThe Web 2.0 revolution has reached its limit because of consumer backlash and much harder, tougher regulation about what data you can collect and how you can use it.\u201d\nIn Europe, the EU already passed several landmark pieces of legislation meant to break up some of the power tech giants like Apple and Alphabet already had on the market. While in the U.S. despite there being no national privacy law there is an unprecedented level of bipartisan and public support for a series of new laws that would limit the amount and type of data that tech companies can collect on users.\nBut despite the hurdles Joshi sees on the horizon for tech, he doesn\u2019t anticipate the whole sector will come crashing down as it did in the dotcom bust. In fact, it will continue to outpace the overall market just at a slower pace. That could still mean tough losses for investors, especially as the market eventually readjusts for a tech sector that no longer delivers hundredfold returns.\nTo be sure, whether or not the market is in the midst of an AI bubble is still hotly debated. Joshi isn\u2019t alone in thinking there is one. Morgan Stanley cautioned against racing headfirst into AI, lest investors not have an adequate lay of the land before the bubble bursts. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs and others argue that soaring returns aren\u2019t a bubble, just the market rewarding the future of technology.\nAs for what investors should do to mitigate the risks of a possible AI bubble, Joshi has some simple advice: invest in other parts of the market like healthcare and luxury goods.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

She declined to offer new details on what type of government grant the company might receive but underlined her focus on AI.\n\"For you, frankly, it's a source of great upside and opportunity and customers,\" she told Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger at the event that also featured Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\nOther major players in AI chip manufacturing, from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) to Micron (MU), are also expected to receive billions and are currently in talks with the government.\n\"These are intensive negotiations; we are in the thick of it now with our major applicants,\" a senior administration official said this week, promising further announcements would be coming within weeks.\nThus far, three smaller manufacturing awards have been promised to BAE Systems (BAESY), Microchip Technology, and GlobalFoundries (GFS).\nThe administration also recently announced a likely award of $5 billion for a public-private consortium called the National Semiconductor Technology Center to quarterback the administration's research efforts.\nRaimondo oversees a team that has ballooned to more than 200 people charged with implementing the CHIPS and Science Act, legislation that was signed into law 18 months ago and designed to confront America's falling share of semiconductor manufacturing.\nRaimondo\u2019s CHIPS Strategy Office is made up of scientists, supply chain and workforce specialists, and others. The team is heavily focused, according to her department, on both immediate-term goals but also planning for the potential impact of AI in the years ahead.\nThe administration is \"going to try to spread their bets a bit widely, which I think makes sense given that nobody knows what the industry will look like in a couple of years,\" says Christopher Miller, the author of a recent history of the semiconductor industry.\nThe question is how much the US government can impact things in the crowded landscape. It will have to compete with China, which is also offering more generous government incentives, and perhaps burgeoning private efforts like Altman's goal of raising up to $7 trillion for semiconductor manufacturing, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\nThe plan has garnered a skeptical media and industry response to whether such a project is possible, as well as the tone Altman has taken. Altman recently posted an apparent reference to the project \u2014 and suggested perhaps it could seek an even more astronomical sum \u2014 asking, \"why not 8\" as well as a shorthand for an expletive.\nEither way, a wide range of officials agree that demand for AI chips will be high. On Wednesday, Raimondo referenced recent talks with Altman and others in the AI space, noting \"the volume of chips that they project they need is mind-boggling, even if you take their projections and cut them in half.\"\nThe US is running behind. It produced nearly 40% of the world's chips in 1990, but less than 10% are made in the US today, according to the White House.\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors: 100% of those are currently manufactured overseas, mostly in Taiwan.\nTECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O'Donnell said AI demand will \"organically\" lead to a new wave of chip research and design, but restarting the manufacturing side may be aided by the government's help.\n\"Chip manufacturing is definitely the bottleneck, and we're seeing it now,\" he says.\nThat point was echoed by Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang Wednesday when he discussed one of the few constraints on his quickly growing business.\n\"We expect that demand will continue to be stronger than our supply provides through the year,\" he told investors on his quarterly earnings call.\nNvidia partners with other companies when it comes to actually manufacturing its chip designs, with TSMC being the main manufacturer of Nvidia's most-advanced chips.\nIndustry figures and administration officials are also wrestling with the question of where the next generation of AI chips will be designed. This is an arena where the US is comfortably positioned at the moment but one that could be disrupted quickly.\nFor one thing, AI is already bringing a flood of new participants into chip designing business. Giants from Google (GOOG) to Amazon (AMZN) are already showing more interest as they seek designs to fuel their AI initiatives.\nArati Prabhakar, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, recently addressed a roomful of industry representatives gathered at the White House and described the administration's overall approach as \"creating the transformative pathways that drive the technology forward but can also reshape the industry.\"\n\"We want to make sure that that happens in a way that creates advantage for our industry, but also advantage for America,\" she added.\nO'Donnell added that AI itself could be used to design the next generation of chips, noting that smaller companies like Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS) and Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) are hoping to utilize generative AI into their chip designs.\n\"It's going to help with perhaps coming up with more efficient chip designs,\" he said, adding, \"right now, it's a market dominated by Nvidia, but it is not guaranteed to be that way in five years.\"\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia stock surges after earnings beat estimates across the board",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) reported its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines.\nFor the quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion. That's a massive jump from the same period last quarter when Nvidia reported EPS of $0.88 on $6.1 billion a year ago. To put a finer point on Nvidia's performance, the company reported $27 billion in revenue for all of 2022.\nThe company also guided higher than analysts' expectations for the first quarter, saying it anticipates revenue of $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $21.9 billion for the quarter.\n\u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.\nShares of Nvidia were up more than 15% in Thursday trading following the report.\n\u201cOur Data Center platform is powered by increasingly diverse drivers \u2014 demand for data processing, training, and inference from large cloud-service providers and GPU-specialized ones, as well as from enterprise software and consumer internet companies. Vertical industries \u2014 led by auto, financial services and healthcare \u2014 are now at a multibillion-dollar level,\" Huang said in the statement.\nDespite the across-the-board beat, Nvidia did have at least one negative comment in its report, with CFO Colette Kress warning that data center revenue out of China fell \"significantly\" in Q4 due to US licensing requirements. The US has blacklisted the sale of certain Nvidia chips to China on fears that they could be used for military applications.\nNvidia's all-important Data Center business, which includes sales of its high-powered GPUs for AI applications, saw revenue of $18.4 billion, beating analysts' expectations of $17.2 billion. The company reported revenue of $3.62 billion in the same quarter last year. Overall, Nvidia's Data Center revenue jumped 217% for the year.\nWhile Nvidia's Data Center segment is driving the ship, its gaming business is still an important piece of the company. Revenue for the division topped out at $2.9 billion. Investors were expecting revenue of $2.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion last year.\nNvidia's stock price has skyrocketed more than 200% over the last 12 months, easily outpacing rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), thanks to its position as the world's leading AI chipmaker.\nNvidia\u2019s growth, however, faces challenges from all sides. The company\u2019s chief rival, AMD, is investing heavily in its own AI chips, including its new MI300X. According to AMD, the chip surpasses Nvidia\u2019s H100 in certain workloads, but Nvidia has refuted those claims, saying AMD\u2019s testing was incomplete. Intel also has its own server chips and continues to build on their capabilities.\nNvidia\u2019s customers are also increasingly looking to develop their own specialized AI chips to ease their reliance on Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla (TSLA) are just a few of the big-name firms that either currently offer or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips.\nAnd that could prove especially problematic as the company said more than half of its Data Center revenue in Q4 came from large cloud providers for internal workloads and external customers.\nBut Nvidia isn\u2019t taking this threat lying down. According to Reuters, the company has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to discuss building custom chips for them.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Nvidia has had a good week. Blockbuster earnings led to a share surge that values the company at $1.9 trillion, making it the third most valuable U.S. company ahead of Alphabet and Amazon. CEO Jensen Huang, who said Wednesday that generative AI is at a \"tipping point,\" is on the cusp of breaking into the world's top 20 richest people.\nYet in its bumper earnings report, Nvidia also warned that its business in China was dropping: The company's data center revenue out of China was at \"mid-single-digit percentage\" levels, coming down from as much as 25% in earlier quarters. U.S. export restrictions are making it difficult for Nvidia to ship products to China.\nAnd it appears that Chinese tech giant Huawei could be swooping in to fill the gap.\nThe U.S. chipmaker named Huawei as one of its competitors in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late on Wednesday. Huawei was the only Chinese company to be listed in several categories, including as a supplier of AI-related chips and as a provider of cloud computing for AI. It's the first time Nvidia has recognized Huawei as a competitor, according to Reuters.\nBaidu and Alibaba were the only other Chinese companies listed by Nvidia as competitors. The U.S. chipmaker also cited Samsung and Renesas Electronics, a Japanese semiconductor manufacturer, as competitors.\nHuawei's Ascend 910B chips are touted as a local alternative to Nvidia's processors, specifically those the U.S. chipmaker designed for the Chinese market to comply with Washington's restrictions.\nChinese companies like Huawei are pitching their products as a safer option if Washington tightens its export restrictions on semiconductors, Reuters reported in December. The Biden administration first imposed export restrictions on advanced chips in October 2022, tightening them again a year later.\nIn its filing, Nvidia said its competitive position \"has been harmed,\" and may be further harmed, by U.S. export controls. The company revealed that its supply chain is concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, including companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung, and Foxconn.\nBeing named as an Nvidia competitor is the latest stage in Huawei's comeback story. The firm, which at one point was battling for survival after being placed on a U.S. blacklist in 2019, recorded nearly $100 billion in revenue last year. That strong performance came after Huawei unveiled its Mate 60 Pro smartphone\u2014featuring a locally-made advanced semiconductor.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled rally was put to the test on the stock market on Feb. 21 when it released its results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on Jan. 28, 2024). It's safe to say that the semiconductor bellwether passed with flying colors as the demand for its graphics cards and processors remains robust.\nThe stakes were high as Nvidia's shares have shot up an enormous 240% in the past year, so it needed to convincingly beat Wall Street's expectations and prove that AI is more than just hype. A closer look at the results of other big tech companies leading up to Nvidia's quarterly report indicated that it was well placed to crush analysts' expectations.\nLet's see how Nvidia fared last quarter and check how much upside investors can expect from this AI stock over the next three years.\nNvidia reported record fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $22.1 billion, a massive increase of 265% from the prior-year period and well ahead of the company's original guidance of $20 billion. What's more, the company's Q4 revenue accelerated at a faster pace than the 206% year-over-year jump it recorded in the fiscal third quarter, indicating that the demand for its chips is increasing. Meanwhile, the company's non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings shot up a whopping 486% year over year to $5.16 per share.\nConsensus estimates were anticipating Nvidia would deliver $4.60 per share in adjusted earnings on revenue of $20.4 billion. The company exceeded expectations by a mile. Also, the company's full-year revenue was up an impressive 126% year over year to $61 billion, while earnings shot up 288% to $12.96 per share. Nvidia witnessed a substantial jump in its non-GAAP gross margin to 73.8% last fiscal year as compared to 59.2% in fiscal 2023, which is a testament to the outstanding pricing power Nvidia enjoys in AI chips.\nEven better, the company's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 suggests that its tremendous growth is here to stay. Nvidia anticipates $24 billion in revenue at the midpoint of its guidance range, which means that it expects its top line to more than triple from the prior-year period's figure of $7.2 billion. Wall Street would have been satisfied with fiscal Q1 revenue of $21.9 billion.\nIt predicts that the non-GAAP gross margin will land between 76.3% and 77%. That would be a big jump as compared to the year-ago period's reading of 66.8%, suggesting that Nvidia's bottom line is set for robust growth once again.\nThe reason why Nvidia is all set to sustain its stunning growth is simple -- the booming demand for its AI chips that are deployed in data centers. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang pointed out in the company's earnings release that \"accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point.\" Third-party estimates indicate the same, with Future Market Insights predicting that the AI chip market could grow tenfold in revenue over the next decade and generate $287 billion in revenue in 2034.\nNvidia is already making the most of this opportunity. Its data center revenue shot up 409% year over year last quarter to $18.4 billion as the demand for its flagship H100 AI GPU (graphics processing unit) remained solid. For the full year, Nvidia's data center revenue reached a record $47.5 billion, an increase of 217% over the prior year. This segment produced 79% of the company's top line last year.\nBased on Gartner's estimate that the AI chip market generated $53 billion in revenue last year, Nvidia's full-year data center revenue indicates that it controlled nearly 90% of this space in 2023. The research firm estimates that global AI chip revenue could hit almost $120 billion in 2027. Assuming Nvidia can maintain its dominance in this market -- which it seems capable of thanks to an aggressive product roadmap -- its data center revenue could increase to $108 billion in the next three years.\nThrow in the other catalysts that Nvidia is sitting on, such as the adoption of generative AI in personal computers (PCs) that is fueling the growth of its gaming business, and it is easy to see why analysts have significantly raised their growth forecasts and are expecting it to sustain its elevated levels of growth going forward.\nAnalysts are forecasting Nvidia's revenue to increase 80% in fiscal 2025 to almost $110 billion, followed by further gains in the next two fiscal years.\nNvidia's revenue is expected to touch almost $150 billion in fiscal 2027. That would be nearly 2.5 times the company's revenue in the previous fiscal year. Nvidia is currently trading at 32 times sales, which is significantly higher than its five-year average sales multiple of 18. The premium valuation is justified, considering the company's terrific growth. The company's forward sales multiple of 18, however, is in line with the five-year average.\nAssuming Nvidia trades at 18 times sales after three years and hits $150 billion in revenue, its market cap could jump to $2.7 trillion, a jump of 37% from current levels. However, this AI stock is likely to deliver much stronger gains if the market continues to reward it with a premium valuation. So, a sales multiple of 30 could elevate its market cap to $4.5 trillion in three years, which would be more than double the current levels.\nThat's why investors would do well to continue holding Nvidia stock since it could keep heading higher over the next three years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has soared in recent times, climbing more than 200% over the past year, thanks to the company's crucial role in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). The tech giant's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the go-to chip for powering AI models.\nDemand in the world of AI may be just getting started. The market, at a compound annual growth rate of 36%, could reach more than $1.3 trillion by 2030, according to a Markets and Markets report. This means there should be plenty of business ahead for Nvidia.\nStill, considering the stock's enormous gain, you may be wondering if a lot of the good news is already priced in at today's level. Is it too late to get in on this AI giant?\nFirst, a bit of background on this top technology stock. Nvidia isn't only an AI stock. In fact, its first major success story happened in the world of gaming, where GPUs revolutionized the visuals and speed needed to make games come to life for users. GPUs break down one main problem into multiple tasks and process these tasks simultaneously, resulting in tremendous speed.\nAlready successful in gaming and graphics applications, the GPU's speed made it the perfect fit for many other uses, especially AI. In 2007, Nvidia launched CUDA, a parallel computing platform that lets coders apply GPUs to AI and general purposes. Since then, the company's GPUs have become a key tool in the \"deep learning\" of AI models because the operation involves the processing of massive quantities of data.\nToday, Nvidia holds more than 80% of the AI chip market, but others aim to challenge this leadership. For example, in December, Advanced Micro Devices launched a new chip series -- the MI300X -- to compete with Nvidia's star H100. Though the new product looks promising, Nvidia says its H100 still remains twice as fast.\nIt may not be too difficult for Nvidia to maintain its lead because the company has progressively increased its research and development (R&D) spending. In the most recent quarter, R&D expenses increased 18% to $2.2 billion. So, yes, rivals are working on increased performance, but so is Nvidia -- and it has the advantage of already being the fastest kid on the block.\nNvidia can afford to make these investments because the company's earnings have skyrocketed -- thanks to its data centers business, which includes AI. In the most recent quarter, revenue rose more than 200% to a record of more than $18 billion. Data centers accounted for $14 billion of that. And net income advanced more than 1,000% to $9.2 billion on a GAAP basis.\nThe company also is reporting high levels of free cash flow, and its return on invested capital shows it's been benefiting from its investment decisions.\nAll of this means Nvidia has what it takes to ensure its leadership position from a technological and financial point of view. This is extremely important, considering that so much of its business now is linked to use outside of the gaming industry.\nNow let's get back to our question: Is it too late to get in on this top-performing stock? After all, the future looks bright, but the stock has climbed in the triple digits in a short period.\nA look at the company's valuation shows that, even after such a gain, it trades for only 33x forward earnings estimates, a dirt cheap level for a profitable company growing revenue in the triple digits.\nConsidering the growth forecasts for the AI market, there's reason to believe Nvidia could keep the momentum going for quite some time -- if it can remain a step ahead of its rivals. That's why it's not too late to buy shares of this top AI stock today because its story in the industry may just be getting started.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Better AI Stock: Nvidia or Super Micro Computer?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "While artificial intelligence (AI) is widely considered a software program, it requires hardware to develop and power it. This leads to investors looking for \"pick-and-shovel\" style investments, as these companies sell the tools needed to power these processes (similar to how many businesses sold picks and shovels to gold miners during the various gold rushes throughout U.S. history).\nTwo of the top \"pick-and-shovel\" plays in the AI market are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). Both stocks have been rocket ships since the start of 2023, with Nvidia and Super Micro Computer's (often called Supermicro) stocks up 437% and 1,000%, respectively.\nBut which one is the better buy now? Let's find out.\nWhile both companies could be considered \"pick-and-shovel\" investments, in reality, Nvidia makes the shovel and pick heads, while Supermicro assembles the tools and sells them to end users.\nNvidia makes the graphics processing units (GPUs) to handle the complex workloads that AI models require. These hardware pieces have been around for a long time and were originally used to process gaming graphics, but have since expanded their usage to engineering simulations, drug discovery, and AI model training.\nWhen companies want to build a supercomputer to harness the power of data through AI, they don't just buy one or two GPUs; they buy hundreds or thousands. To get the most use out of them, they must also be strategically placed and connected to a server, which is where Supermicro comes in.\nSupermicro builds these servers for clients and offers highly configurable models that can be tailored to end-use and computing power expectations. They work closely with Nvidia to ensure they're squeezing every ounce of performance out of their servers, which benefits users in the long run.\nBut as to which makes more sense to invest in, there's a clear choice.\nSupermicro is heavily dependent on Nvidia for business. If Nvidia chooses to fulfill GPU orders to other clients or the relationship sours, Supermicro's business will be crushed. These two companies have been partners for a while, so I don't see this happening, but it is something to keep in mind.\nFurthermore, Supermicro has fierce competition from other server builders like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, while Nvidia's AI GPUs are in a class of their own.\nThis heavily skews the bias toward Nvidia, but another factor is also at play.\nBoth stocks were undervalued entering 2023, but Supermicro's stock was unbelievably cheap at just over six times forward earnings.\nThat's why Supermicro has outperformed Nvidia's stock over the past year, but that will likely stop soon. Now that Supermicro is more expensive than Nvidia, buying it doesn't make a ton of sense, especially if they're growing at the same pace.\nNvidia's business model is far superior because it controls the primary product, giving it an advantage when assessing profit margins.\nNvidia is far more profitable than Supermicro, and if you give me a choice between two stocks that are evenly priced and growing around the same pace, then I'll choose the more profitable one every single time.\nWhile both companies will succeed as the AI buildout continues, I'm more excited about Nvidia due to its superior margins and control over the primary product. Super Micro Computer may be a solid company to invest in, but you're better off picking Nvidia at these prices.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Decoding NVIDIA Corp (NVDA): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Robust revenue growth with a 126% increase year-over-year, reaching $60.9 billion in FY 2024.\nSignificant expansion in the Data Center segment, with a 217% increase in revenue.\nOperational excellence reflected in increased gross margins and comprehensive income.\nStrategic positioning in key markets: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nOn February 21, 2024, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), a trailblazer in graphics processing units and a vanguard of artificial intelligence technology, released its 10-K filing, revealing a transformative year. The company's financials underscore its robust performance, with a staggering 126% increase in revenue to $60.9 billion, compared to the previous year. NVIDIA's strategic pivot towards data centers and AI has paid dividends, as evidenced by the 217% surge in Data Center revenue. The company's gross profit soared to $44.3 billion, reflecting operational efficiency and market demand for its innovative products. With a comprehensive income of $29.83 billion and a diluted net income per share of $11.93, NVIDIA's financial health is formidable, setting the stage for a detailed SWOT analysis.\nMarket Leadership in Data Center and AI: NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has cemented its position as a leader in the Data Center and AI markets. The company's revenue from this segment skyrocketed by 217% in FY 2024, reaching $47.5 billion. This growth is driven by the launch of AI inference platforms and the introduction of NVIDIA DGX Cloud and AI Foundations, which cater to the burgeoning demand for generative AI and large language models. NVIDIA's dominance is further evidenced by its GPUs and networking solutions powering over 75% of the supercomputers on the global TOP500 list, including 24 of the top 30 systems on the Green500 list. This strength not only showcases NVIDIA's technological prowess but also its ability to capture and lead high-growth markets.\nFinancial Robustness: NVIDIA's financial performance in FY 2024 is a testament to its strength. The company's revenue growth to $60.9 billion, coupled with a gross profit of $44.3 billion, reflects its ability to scale and capitalize on market opportunities effectively. NVIDIA's net income of $29.76 billion and a diluted net income per share of $11.93 underscore its profitability and financial stability. This financial robustness provides NVIDIA with the capital necessary to invest in research and development, expand its product offerings, and pursue strategic acquisitions, further solidifying its market position.\nSupply Chain Concentration: Despite its financial success, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces potential risks associated with its supply chain. The company's manufacturing operations are heavily concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, relying on foundries such as TSMC and Samsung. This concentration could expose NVIDIA to geopolitical risks, trade tensions, and supply chain disruptions, which could impact its ability to deliver products consistently and at competitive prices. Diversifying its supply chain could mitigate these risks and ensure more stable operations.\nDependence on Third-Party Suppliers: NVIDIA's fabless manufacturing strategy means it depends on third-party suppliers for wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. While this allows NVIDIA to focus on design and innovation, it also reduces control over product quantity, quality, and delivery schedules. Any disruptions or defects from suppliers could harm NVIDIA's business and reputation. Strengthening relationships with suppliers and building redundancy in the supply chain are crucial to minimizing these weaknesses.\nExpansion into New Markets: NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has the opportunity to leverage its AI and GPU technologies to expand into new markets.

        "Title": "Should You Buy This Mysterious Nvidia Partner Before Everyone Else Does?",
        "Author": "  Bradley Guichard, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the reasons Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been so successful in the age of data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) involves the \"picks and shovels\" economic theory. This theory points out that, during a gold rush, the most successful participants are less likely to be the gold hunters and more likely to be the ones selling the tools the gold miners need for the hunt. Nvidia's high-powered graphic processing units (GPU) and software are the picks and shovels of data centers and AI.\nBut Nvidia doesn't act alone. It has several suppliers it depends on to provide technology and materials used to make its finished products. These would be the ax and shovel head suppliers and wooden handle makers of the \"picks and shovels\" theory. One of these suppliers to the supplier is Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL).\nMarvell is not all that well known among retail investors. However, Citi analyst Atif Malik recently made the company his top specialty semiconductor stock, lifting it above Nvidia on his list of recommendations. One reason is probably that Nvidia's stock has already gained 208% over the last year, while Marvell is up just 53%.\nToday's connected and increasingly cloud-based world requires immense amounts of data to be processed through massive data centers. Those data centers often are over 100,000 square feet in size, and cloud services providers (think Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure) plan on adding 50 to 100 annually.\nThe rapid adoption of generative AI will increase bandwidth needs exponentially. Marvell's technology, such as optical interconnects and cloud-optimized silicon, enables data centers to meet these needs. Optical interconnects transmit signals using light to support data center functions, and cloud-optimized silicon is critical to high-speed, low-power processing. Marvell also sells products for the automotive and consumer electronics industries, among others. However, nearly 40% of its revenue comes from the data center market.\nData center sales were the reason for Nvidia's massive recent success. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), Nvidia's data center revenue rose 279% year over year to $14.5 billion. This incredible growth bodes well for Marvell as well.\nMarvell will also benefit from advanced automotive technologies like driver assist features and even autonomous driving. Just like data centers, these systems need to move data incredibly rapidly, and Marvell's products enable this level of performance. The secular opportunity for the company across multiple industries is impressive.\nWhile its long-term opportunities are terrific, the semiconductor industry is cyclical and tied to PC sales, and 2023 was a down year for most of the industry. For the first three quarters of Marvell's fiscal 2024, (a period that ended Oct. 28), its sales fell 9% year over year to $4.1 billion. The company posted an operating loss of $543 million for that period compared to an operating profit of $214 million the year before. However, the picture gets brighter when digging deeper.\nFor instance, through Q3 of fiscal 2024, Marvell produced $824 million in operating cash flow despite the aforementioned losses. This is because over $1 billion of its expenses were for non-cash items like amortization of intangible assets, depreciation, and restructuring charges. These non-cash expenses make its results look poor but can be misleading. Marvell reported a non-GAAP operating profit of $1.1 billion on a 27% margin over the same period.\nThe stock is challenging to value because of all these moving parts. Marvell has a market cap of $60 billion. Analysts expect $6.1 billion in sales and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.02 in the next fiscal year, giving it a price-to-earnings ratio of around 35. In addition, the average analyst price target of $72 per share is just 3% above the stock's current price, suggesting that the stock is fairly valued.\nIt's easy to see why there is growing buzz for Marvell. The company is knee-deep in two explosive industries, and it may be worth it for investors to pick up a small speculative position in the stock. Still, its fair valuation today means that interested investors don't need to rush, and should consider a strategy like dollar-cost averaging or buying the dip.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Marvell Technology right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Marvell Technology, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Marvell Technology wasn't one of them.

Hong Kong-listed shares are considered a good proxy for the Chinese market, as they meet international accounting standards and are directly accessible to brokerages worldwide.\nThe chipmaker behemoth's market cap has nearly quadrupled since the start of last year. Its stock soared 239% in 2023, and is up 41% this year alone, through Thursday. Only four US public companies are worth more.\nMeanwhile, China's economic malaise has sent stocks tumbling lower. Lackluster economic growth and a prolonged real-estate crash have weighed on the market. The country has also been dealing with deflation. The Hang Seng index, a benchmark for Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks, has dropped 26% over the past year and 8% year-to-date.\nBut Hartnett noted there could be an opportunity for investors who can identify Chinese stocks with strong management, strong balance sheets, and strong earnings. He notes the precedent of Japan's Nikkei collapse in the early 1990s, which then saw a select group of 15 companies possessing those characteristics rallying to a 400% bull market.\nCorrection: February 12, 2024 \u2014 An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of the Bank of America chief investment strategist.

        "Text": "The AI trade is back in full force after Nvidia's (NVDA) big earnings beat, defying fears that euphoria over the technology may have reached its peak.\nShares of SoundHound (SOUN) and Arm (ARM), companies Nvidia recently revealed it invested in, both rose about 5% on Thursday. AMD (AMD), another AI chip play, rose more than 10% while AI-driven stock Palantir popped over 3%. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), which has been on a meteoric 200% rise this year, soared nearly 33% on Thursday alone.\nThe reach of Nvidia's success was seen beyond just the tech space. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed at record highs. A slew of other companies that aren't AI focused, including JPMorgan (JPM) and Waste Management (WM), also ended Thursday at their highest prices ever.\nAll of these moves higher come just a week after a hotter-than-expected inflation report spawned a mini-market sell-off and as Federal Reserve officials continue to indicate interest rate cuts are likely to come later than many hoped.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) won over Wall Street last year, illustrated by its more than 210% stock growth since January 2023.\nThe company's years of dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs) perfectly positioned it to profit significantly from a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) as demand for the chips skyrocketed. As a result, Nvidia's quarterly revenue and free cash flow are up 200% and 360%, respectively, in the last 12 months.\nNvidia's meteoric rise has some analysts questioning whether the company has much more to offer investors in 2024. However, trends in the chip market indicate Nvidia will have little problem retaining its leading market share in AI GPUs, despite new offerings from Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.\nMeanwhile, the AI market is nowhere near hitting its ceiling, projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. The sector's potential indicates GPU demand is likely to continue rising for the foreseeable future, with Nvidia well equipped to continue enjoying significant gains from AI.\nSo here's why Nvidia remains an attractive buy right now.\nNvidia's success in the AI chip market has led to countless tech firms announcing ventures into the industry. Leading chipmakers AMD and Intel plan to begin shipping new GPUs soon in an attempt to challenge Nvidia's market share. Meanwhile, companies new to the sector are also joining in, with Amazon and Microsoft announcing new AI chips last year.\nHowever, market trends suggest Nvidia's supremacy will be challenging for competitors to overcome. The company has held an over 80% market share in desktop GPUs for years, despite AMD's and Intel's presence in the sector.\nIntel only entered the industry last year, while AMD's history in desktop GPUs spans decades. Still, AMD's GPUs only account for about 10% of the market.\nA similar situation has occurred in another area of the chip market. Intel was a king in central processing units (CPUs) for years, with an 82% market share at the start of 2017 when AMD landed on the scene with its Ryzen line of CPUs. AMD has managed to steal a significant share from Intel since then. However, Intel is still responsible for most of the CPU market, with its share above 60% and AMD's at 36%.\nNvidia's estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI GPUs could falter slightly as competition heats up. However, history indicates the company will retain its overall lead and continue to see major gains from AI for years.\nNvidia stunned Wall Street last year, posting multiple quarters of record earnings. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company's revenue soared 206% year over year to $18 billion. Meanwhile, operating income increased by more than 1,600% to $10 billion.\nWhile a spike in AI GPU sales is mainly responsible for Nvidia's stellar financial growth, the chipmaker is also profiting from an improving PC market. Spikes in inflation prompted steep declines in PC sales, with shipments dipping 16% in 2022 and continuing to fall for most of 2023. However, recent reports indicate the market is finally showing signs of recovery.\nAccording to Gartner, PC shipments popped 0.3% in Q4 2023, marking the first such increase in over a year. Market improvements have reflected in Nvidia's sales, with its PC-centered gaming segment reporting an 81% rise in revenue in Q3 2024 (which ended October 2023).\nA leading role in AI and a recovering PC market suggests Nvidia has a strong outlook in the coming years, and EPS estimates seem to support this.\nThis chart shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 51 yields a stock price of $1,224.\nConsidering its current position, that projection would see Nvidia's stock rise 96% over the next two years. It's a tall order, but based on reasonable financial forecasts.\nThe company may not replicate last year's growth, but Nvidia still has much to offer new investors and is an exciting buy right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "Text": "The stock of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a massive winner, jumping 450% over the past three years as the leader of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nNvidia should continue to be a strong stock, but at a $2 trillion market cap and 36 times this year's earnings estimates, it would be hard-pressed to repeat that performance over the next three years.\nYet the AI revolution should also benefit a host of other tech names, including those that still remain well below their 2021 highs. For potentially bigger upside, investors should tune into this sneaky AI inference play that could really take off over the next few years.\nNot many people recognize networking and security leader Cloudflare (NYSE: NET) as an AI play. After all, the company got its start as a website, content delivery, and software-application performance-enhancer, helping enterprises large and small boost the performance of their websites and applications. From there, the company expanded into cybersecurity, protecting those websites and applications from attacks. Then Cloudflare was able to leverage its global footprint in ISP data centers to unveil smart networking products, offering security and simplification by unifying an enterprise's on-premises data centers with public and private clouds all in one easy interface.\nCloudflare built its software products out of a single software stack on commodity hardware, which gives it a leg-up on rivals that may have to switch software and hardware configurations based on different products. And with its speed-boosting services benefiting internet service providers (ISPs), Cloudflare has been able to put its servers directly within ISP data centers worldwide. That's led to a massive current footprint spanning 310 cities in over 120 countries, interconnecting over 13,000 global networks.\nThat architecture and footprint make it really easy for Cloudflare to deploy new products relative to rivals.\nCloudflare's flexible software and massive network have positioned it extremely well for the next phase of the artificial intelligence revolution. The past 18 months or so have seen AI companies largely concentrating on training AI models like ChatGPTs, Geminis, or Llamas, largely within cloud-data centers.\nBut now the AI industry will move to more inferencing as enterprises and customers begin to deploy and interact with those models in a variety of ways.\nThat's where Cloudflare's global-edge network comes in handy. Aside from networking and secure edge, Cloudflare has in recent years deployed a developer platform on its servers called Workers. Workers allows developers to augment or develop lightweight applications in Cloudflare servers without having to travel all the way back to a larger cloud-data center.\nThe Workers platform is newer but has become popular. Thus, it's not surprising Cloudflare eventually found a way to serve the computing-intensive AI market on Workers, unveiling Workers AI in September of last year.\nWorkers AI is essentially an inference-as-a-service platform Cloudflare developed by deploying graphics processing units (GPUs) across its server platform. Because of Cloudflare's flexible software stack, the company has been able to seamlessly drop this offering into its existing server footprint rather quickly.\nWorkers AI allows developers to use some of the most popular open-source AI models, such as Meta Platforms' Llama or Hugging Face already configured for Cloudflare's infrastructure, then seamlessly add proprietary data in a secure manner via Cloudflare Vectorize. That puts Cloudflare more in direct competition with the cloud giants for AI model building and processing, at least for smaller models.\nBut the big opportunity may just be running all your inferencing within Cloudflare's servers as opposed to sending that processing traffic back to public clouds. As CEO Matthew Prince noted on the fourth-quarter conference call with analysts:\n[W]e think that -- you know, that we're ... Goldilocks in that space where, you know, the -- the centralized public clouds are too far away and your ... device that you're holding in your hand or wearing on your wrist is -- often doesn't have enough power, but where we are sitting in between gives that really incredible place for inference.\nGiven that we are just at the start of the AI era and that so many applications will now be run via AI inference in the future, it's not hard to see how the inference market could become massive in the next decade. And Cloudflare may be ideally positioned to capitalize.\nEarly results are already promising. Management noted daily Workers AI requests increased a whopping ninefold just between the September launch and December.

        "Title": "Nvidia earnings: Wall Street grows more bullish on the 'AI ecosystem of choice'",
        "Author": "  Josh Schafer    \u00b7 Reporter",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) once again surpassed Wall Street's lofty expectations with its latest earnings report.\nFor the quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion. The numbers represent significant increases from last year's results in the same period. Earnings rose more than 486% while revenue was up more than 262%.\nThe company also guided higher than analysts' expectations for the first quarter, saying it anticipates revenue of $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $21.9 billion for the quarter.\nWall Street reacted with a slew of boosted price targets and overall bullish sentiment on the stock that rose double digits on Thursday following its earnings release. The median price target on the stock rose 19% following the report.\nBelow is a collection of comments Wall Street is making about Nvidia after its fourth quarter earnings release.\nToshiya Hari, Goldman Sachs, Buy rating, price target $875 (from $800) \n\"Nvidia delivered against what was seemingly a very high bar with Data Center once again serving as the key growth driver. Looking ahead, despite the [greater than three times year-over-year] increase in Data Center revenue in FY2024, we model another [greater than two times year-over-year] increase in FY2025 as we expect not only sustained growth in Gen AI infrastructure spending by the large [communication service providers] and consumer internet companies, but also increased development and adoption of AI across enterprise customers representing various industry verticals and, increasingly, sovereign states.\"\nVedvati Shrotre, Jefferies, Buy rating, price target $780 (from $610)\n\"We've observed that computing eras are typically dominated by a single ecosystem that is provided by a single, vertically integrated chip+hardware+software company, like IBM in mainframes and Apple in smartphones. NVDA's strong commentary regarding use for GPUs for inference and training workloads foots with our field checks that NVDA has become the AI ecosystem of choice. We think many investors continue to underestimate the amount of investment NVDA has poured into its ecosystem, and the lead that has given the company in the market, which has translated to a virtuous circle of software developers and platform suppliers embracing NVDA as the ecosystem of choice for AI workloads.\"\nVivek Arya, Bank of America, Buy rating, price target $925 (from $800)\n\"Perhaps the most important new datapoint in NVDA's earnings call was that AI inference contributed nearly 40% of AI computing mix in FY24/CY23. AI inference is correlated with revenue bearing AI which is supposed to be more competitive, as opposed to AI training which NVDA already dominates. Second, we highlight the company's positive commentary around tight supply, low China dependence (only mid-single digit percent of data center sales versus 20%-25% prior to restrictions), new pipeline, rising sovereign demand for AI among others.\"\nTimothy Arcuri, UBS Investment Bank, Buy rating, price target $800 (from $800)\n\"There were a few items that could maybe suggest some slowing revenue growth on the horizon (mostly supply and opex) but we will have to see how these evolve. The bottom line is that we are still in such early stages of what is possible with AI (especially health care/drug discovery) and NVDA is the de-facto global AI platform, it seems too soon to take a more cautious view. We are trimming estimates a bit to reflect some potential slowing in revenue growth and price target goes from $850 to $800 but we maintain our Buy.\"\nHarlan Sur, JPMorgan, Overweight rating, price target $850 (from $650)\n\"The [Nividia] team noted that demand will continue to outstrip supply through CY24, allaying fears of an inventory build/correction in the 2H of the year. The team feels constructive on the sustained growth into CY25+ driven by transition to accelerated computing, proliferation of generative AI applications, and build-out of sovereign AI.\n\"The team provided examples of the strong AI monetization from their customers ( e.g. ServiceNow drove their largest ever net-new annual contract value contribution, Microsoft 365 Copilot grew faster in its first two months than the two previous major Microsoft 365 enterprise suite).\"\nAtif Malik, Citi analyst, Buy rating, price target $820\n\"Nvidia expects AI demand to remain strong and above supply through the year. China was down sharply due to US restrictions ... Inference sales were 40% of data center sales last year and the company expects data center infrastructure installed base of $1T to double over the next five years. While [year-over-year] data center comps could pose a headwind for the stock, long-term earnings power looks attractive based on our $200B compute TAM by 2027.\"\nGil Luria, D.A. Davidson, Neutral rating, price target $620\n\"While FY2025 will be a terrific year for NVIDIA, we believe that FY2026 and beyond may not see continued growth. Messaging from the four largest customers suggests that they're accelerating spend this year to meet current demand but are characterizing their purchasing as demand-driven, implying the possibility of scaling down compute spend once we approach the trough of disillusionment. We believe that customers like Microsoft are not interested in indefinitely sustaining this level of Capex dedicated solely to AI compute, yet alone NVIDIA. Consequently, we believe our FY26 and FY27 estimates reflect a Street low, as we see potential for a sequential decline in NVIDIA's data center business starting sometime over the next 4-6 quarters. We are raising our target to $620 from $410 to reflect a higher cyclical peek this year than we previously estimated.\"\nRuben Roy, Stifel, Buy rating, price target $910 (from $865)\n\"As questions regarding the sustainability of NVDA's growth increase, we found management commentary on revenue diversification notable. In addition to continued growth of Networking and Software NVDA's overall Data Center revenue is increasingly diversifying across industries and regions, including a growing contribution from demand related to sovereign AI deployments. This diversification, in our view, is likely to continue as AI-related [return on investment] for end users accelerates. NVDA continues to believe that the migration from general purpose compute to accelerated compute represents a $1 trillion opportunity, longer-term ... We continue to expect NVDA to be the primary beneficiary of AI infrastructure deployments over the next several years. Despite supply improvements across NVDA\u2019s product set, management continues to see strong demand over the medium-term with expectations for demand to continue to outstrip supply of new products.\"\nAnanda Baruah, Loop Capital, Buy rating, price target $1,200 \n\"We believe NVDA could be looking at a $150B GPU opportunity in CY2024. A key difference in our view vs. Street (we believe) is our work regarding high-end Data Center GPUs where we see NVDA tracking towards 5.0M for CY2024/FY2025 and 6.5M+ for CY2025/FY2026. It is our belief that Street (through investor conversations) is positioned at 4.0M \u2013 4.5M TOTAL Enterprise & Data Center GPUs for CY2024 / FY2025.\"\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated Toshiya Hari's first name.

        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) inception aimed to revolutionize 3D computer graphics for gaming and multimedia sectors. Initially achieving success with various chips, the company made a significant leap in 1999 with the introduction of the Nvidia GeForce 256, the world's first graphics processing unit (GPU).\nThis milestone had culminated in the latest GeForce RTX 40 Series, which can deliver life-like graphics to digital content with the help of Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), an incredible innovation by Nvidia. DLSS uses artificial intelligence (AI) to create additional frames in a video game scene and enhance image quality.\nUntil fiscal 2022 (ended Jan. 30, 2022), gaming was routinely Nvidia's largest revenue driver. The segment generated $12.5 billion in sales that year, which accounted for 46% of the company's total revenue. But then, everything changed:\nData centers used to be where companies stored valuable information, but have since evolved to become centralized hubs for online operations (otherwise known as cloud computing). Today, data centers are home to powerful chips designed by Nvidia to process AI workloads.\nThe shift began in 2016 when Nvidia delivered the first AI supercomputer to OpenAI, which it used to develop the early generative AI models that culminated in the famous ChatGPT online chatbot.\nNow, Nvidia's leading H100 data center GPUs sell for up to $40,000 a pop. With centralized data center operators like Microsoft and Amazon ordering hundreds of thousands of them to give cloud customers the computing power they need to develop AI. \nIt sent Nvidia's data center revenue soaring 279% year over year in the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29, 2023). The data center segment now accounts for 80% of Nvidia's total revenue, leaving the gaming segment in the dust.\nNvidia is now a $1.8 trillion behemoth, and $1 trillion of that value was created in the last 12 months alone. The good news is that Nvidia stock could probably still go higher from here.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is Nvidia or Meta Platforms the Better Dividend Stock?",
        "Author": "  George Budwell, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) are two of the most successful technology companies in the world. However, these tech titans have historically had very different approaches to rewarding their shareholders. For instance, Nvidia has been paying a quarterly dividend since its fiscal 2012 year, while Meta Platforms will pay its first dividend in March 2024.\nWhich one is the better dividend stock? Let's compare them based on some key metrics to find out.\nRevenue growth: Both companies have been increasing their revenue at breakneck rates, but Nvidia has been faster in recent history. In the past five years, Nvidia's revenue has skyrocketed 147%, while Meta's revenue has jumped 90.8%. Nvidia's revenue growth has been driven by strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) in the gaming, data center, artificial intelligence, and automotive markets. Meta's revenue growth has been fueled by its dominant position in social media, online advertising, and virtual reality.\nMETA Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts\nEPS growth: Nvidia has also been more profitable than Meta over the past five years, as measured by diluted normalized earnings per share (EPS). Over this period, Nvidia's EPS has soared by 473%, while Meta's EPS has risen by 123%. Nvidia's EPS growth has benefited from its high-margin GPU business and efficient capital allocation. Meta's EPS expansion has been hampered by its high operating expenses stemming from its build-out of the metaverse. Still, the social media company's five-year EPS growth is impressive, even though it doesn't compare favorably to Nvidia's scorching bottom-line growth over this time frame.\nEPS growth outlook: Looking ahead, both companies are expected to increase their EPS at robust rates, but Nvidia is the clear winner on this metric. According to analysts' estimates, Nvidia's EPS ought to rise by a whopping 71.6% in fiscal 2025. Meta, on the other hand, is expected to post EPS growth of 15.1% in calender year 2025. Nvidia's bottom line is booming due to the explosion in demand for chips capable of handling generative artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.\nRevenue growth outlook: Similarly, both companies are projected to increase their revenue at healthy rates, but Nvidia wins again on this metric as well. Analysts forecast Nvidia's revenue will climb 59.5% in fiscal 2025. That easily trumps Meta's projected revenue boost of 12.4% in calendar year 2025. In absolute terms, though, Meta's double-digit revenue growth forecast is impressive in its own right.\nValuation: Thanks to their stellar growth profiles, both companies have earned a premium valuation. Nvidia's stock is presently trading at 35.5 times projected earnings, while while Meta's shares trade for 23.3 times forward earnings. For reference, the S&P 500 index sports a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of 22.9 at the time of this writing. As such, Nvidia and Meta are both expensive relative to the broader market, but Meta stock has the more compelling valuation.\nDividend yield: One of the main attractions of dividend stocks is their yield, which measures how much income they generate for investors relative to their share price. Currently, Nvidia has a tiny dividend yield of just 0.02%. Meta's annualized yield stands at 0.43%. Meta thus offers the richer dividend of the two.\nDebt-to-equity ratio: This is a measure of financial leverage that compares how much debt a business uses to finance its assets relative to its equity. This metric is also a proxy for the health of a company's balance sheet. A lower ratio indicates less reliance on debt and more financial stability. Nvidia has a debt-to-equity ratio of 33.1%, indicating a robust balance sheet. Meta, for its part, sports a debt-to-equity ratio of 24.7%. Overall, both companies have strong balance sheets, which is a great sign in terms of the reliability of their cash distributions to shareholders.\nBased on these metrics, Nvidia is a better dividend stock than Meta Platforms. While Meta has a higher dividend yield, Nvidia has a much faster EPS growth rate and it is a critical player in AI architecture. Nvidia's dividend may be small, but it is likely to rise steadily over time, along with its earnings. Meta's dividend may be larger, but the company is more vulnerable to regulatory and competitive headwinds. Hence, dividend investors may want to opt for Nvidia over Meta Platforms.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Noel Randewich ",
        "Text": "By Noel Randewich\n(Reuters) -Nvidia eclipsed Google-parent Alphabet as the third most valuable U.S. company on Wednesday, just after overtaking Amazon and as investors looked to the dominant AI chipmaker's upcoming quarterly report.\nThe Santa Clara, California company's stock rose 2.46%, putting its value at $1.825 trillion, while Alphabet's stock climbed 0.55%, leaving it with a value of $1.821 trillion.\nNvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build AI into their products and services, and the latest gain in its stock came a day after it ended a session with a market capitalization above Amazon's for the first time in two decades.\nAmazon's market capitalization was $1.776 trillion after its stock rose 1.39% on Wednesday.\nNvidia controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, a position that has boosted its stock price 47% this year after it more than tripled in 2023. Customers face shortages of Nvidia's top-of-the-line components while AI developers face months-long waiting lists to use its processors through cloud-computing providers.\nTechnology-related companies, including Microsoft and Meta Platforms, have also rallied to record highs on AI optimism.\nNvidia's quarterly report next Wednesday will be among Wall Street's most closely watched of the week. Analysts expect another blowout quarter and outlook, and anything less could deflate Wall Street's AI rally, some investor warned.\n\"The market recognizes Nvidia as the AI king. But if Nvidia has one bad quarterly report, if they don\u2019t overly-exceed investors\u2019 expectations, this thing could sell off 20 or 30 percent in one after-hours session,\" said Jake Dollarhide, Chief Executive Officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa.\nSusquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland on Wednesday increased his price target for Nvidia's stock to $850 from $625, saying he expects strong quarterly results and guidance. Nvidia shares were last at $739.\nAn early leader in the AI race, Microsoft in January overtook Apple to become the world's most valuable company, now valued at over $3 trillion. State oil giant Saudi Aramco is the world's third most valuable publicly-listed company, according to LSEG.\nAnalysts, on average, see Nvidia's January fiscal quarter revenue more than tripling to $20.37 billion, fueled by demand for its top-shelf AI chips, according to LSEG data. Analysts see its adjusted net profit surging over 400% to $11.38 billion.\nNvidia is trading at around 34 times expected earnings, up from about 24 in early January, and down from over 50 a year ago, according to LSEG.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich in Oakland, Calif., and by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur, Nick Zieminski and David Gregorio)\n"

        "Text": "US stocks rallied late in the day on Wednesday as investors counted down to high-stakes earnings from AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) and digested the release of Federal Reserve minutes which reiterated the central bank's focus on not cutting interest rates too soon.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped about 0.1%, or almost 50 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, down 0.3% on the heels of Tuesday's declines.\nStocks are lagging, with the focus fixed on looming results from Nvidia, whose shares fell almost 3% on Tuesday for their worst day since Oct. 17 as investors positioned for the release. The stock extended that loss on Wednesday, falling more than 3% heading into its earnings release. Expectations are running high for the chipmaker's fourth quarter results, seen both as a barometer for the AI trade and as a potential turning point for stocks more broadly.\nThe market is on edge for any disappointment in the report, expected after the bell. Nvidia is one of a small group of megacaps behind a big chunk of recent gains for stock indexes. Mixed prospects for growth among those \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have prompted hedge funds to cut holdings, according to Goldman Sachs.\nIn corporates, shares of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) tumbled over 28% after the cybersecurity provider cut its annual revenue forecast, igniting concerns about a potential pullback in tech spending. Meanwhile, Walgreens shares (WBA) slid as much as 3% after the pharmacy giant lost its spot on the blue-chip Dow index to Amazon (AMZN).\nMinutes from the Fed's January meeting released on Wednesday showed most Fed officials \"noted the risks of moving too quickly\" in easing interest rates during the most recent meeting. Recent discouraging data has prompted a wavering in conviction that the central bank will cut rates in June, seen as the most probable timing.\nAfter the closing bell, Nvida reported fourth quarter earnings, and first quarter revenue guidance, that exceeded Wall Street's lofty expectations. The company guided for first quarter revenue of $24 billion plus or minus 2%, above Wall Street's projections for $21.9 billion. Shares rose as much as 7% in after hours trading.\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nNvidia reported fourth quarter earnings that topped Wall Street's lofty expectations on Wednesday afternoon but noted its data sales to China declined significantly.\nThe company's fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $5.16 topped analyst expectations for $4.64. Meanwhile, fourth quarter revenue of $22.1 billion came in higher than analyst projections for $20.4 billion.\nThe company also guided higher than analysts' expectations for the first quarter, saying it anticipates revenue of $24 billion plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $21.9 billion for quarter.\nShares of Nvidia climbed about 2% following the report.\nUS stocks rallied late in the day on Wednesday as investors counted down to high-stakes earnings from AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) and digested the release of Federal Reserve minutes that reiterated the central bank's focus on not cutting interest rates too soon.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped about 0.1%, or almost 50 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, down 0.3% on the heels of Tuesday's declines.\nEarnings results from the AI leader Nvidia (NVDA) are set to hit the tape after the close on Wednesday. As we've covered extensively over the last few days, these results are expected to be a litmus test for the AI narrative, and perhaps the current market rally as whole. \nGiven the stock's more than 200% rise over the past year, even if the company tops its massive expectations, the attractiveness of the stock trading near all-time highs will serve as a signal of investors' risk appetite.\nBut Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni cautioned that investors shouldn't read too far into Wednesday's report, even if it proves to be a market moving event.\n\"It's a very short-term story,\" Yardeni said.\nYardeni, who has a 5,400 year-end target on the S&P 500 for 2024 and sees the benchmark index reaching 6,500 by the end of 2026, believes AI will play a role in that rise. But it's not the whole story.\n\"[Nvidia's report] is obviously viewed as a big deal,\" Yardeni said. \"But overall there's more going on in this economy than just Nvidia or artificial intelligence. The reality is that the economy proves to be remarkably resilient. It continues to grow at a good pace. Inflation's come down despite the fact that the unemployment rate remains below 4%.\n\"So it's been a great economy and the stock market reflects that. I don't think the AI story is the entire story here.\"\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page on Wednesday afternoon as shares tumbled more than 28% after the company's latest quarterly results were released on Tuesday afternoon. The cybersecurity company, whose stock had risen more than 100% over the past year, missed Wall Street's expectations for current year revenue guidance. Palo Alto guided for full-year revenue in a range of $7.95 billion to $8 billion, below analyst expectations for $8.18 billion.\nShares of fellow cybersecurity companies CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Zscaler (ZS) also sold off on the news, falling more than 10% after Palo Alto's report.\nMeanwhile, Teladoc Health (TDOC) shares fell more than 25% following the company's latest quarterly results release. Teladoc's earnings per share and revenue guidance for 2024 fell short of Wall Street's estimates as CEO Jason Gorevic described the telehealth market as \"fairly well-penetrated.\"\nThe minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting, released on Wednesday, showed officials remain cautious on cutting interest rates too soon.\n\"Most participants noted the risks of moving too quickly to ease the stance of policy,\" the minutes said.\nMeanwhile, only a \"couple\" officials highlighted the downside risks of holding policy in a restrictive stance.\nThe major stock averages ticked down slightly after the minutes reiterated many of the same talking points Fed officials have recently been touting, including that further confidence is needed that inflation will continue on its path downward.\nMarkets are continuing to price in the first interest rate cut in June. As of Wednesday afternoon, investor bets placed a 73% chance that the central bank cuts interest rates in June, per the CME FedWatch Tool. \nIt\u2019s a brutal day for Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and its cast of cybersecurity rivals.\nIn fact, there has been very little dip-buying in the stock judging by the action all day. The ticker has also remained tops on Yahoo Finance since this morning.\nShares of the cybersecurity play \u2014 and AI investor favorite \u2014 are selling off by close to 30% amid a shift in growth strategy towards free incentives that has sparked concern on the Street.\nBut, Advisors Capital Management Partner JoAnne Feeney\u00a0cautioned, the steep sell-off isn\u2019t a sign of weakening AI demand. And in fact, investors should use the dip in share price as an opportunity to \"get in.\"\nBold, and indeed contrarian on a day like this for Palo Alto.\n\u201cYou have a lot of short-term holders that recognize the next few months could be bumpy. ... There's questions about how much growth they can generate because of this shift in strategy,\u201d Feeney told me on Yahoo Finance Live. \u201cBut when you look into that shift, and what it portends for the future, it's a lot more potential to take market share.\u201d\nUltimately, the stock is on track for its biggest intraday drop on record. Rivals CrowdStrike (CRWD), Fortinet (FTNT), and Zscaler (ZS) also declined on the results as investors brace for Palo Alto-like warnings.\nMedia companies like Disney (DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) used to compete for subscribers to their streaming services. Now, they are looking to team up too.\nDisney's ESPN, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Fox (FOXA) announced they would launch a sports streaming service this upcoming fall. Meanwhile, Paramount (PARA) and Peacock owner Comcast (CMCSA) have held discussions about a potential joint streaming venture, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.\nThe developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), which are gobbling up streaming deals.\n\"Big Tech is now in this game,\" Jon Christian, executive vice president of digital media supply chain at entertainment consulting firm Qvest, told Yahoo Finance. \"These are highly diversified businesses that have a lot of money. It's a much different set of competitors for these legacy networks and studios.\"\nAs a result, consolidation through mergers and acquisitions or partnerships is the only way for these traditional players to compete, according to Christian.\n\"At the end of the day, you have to look at the consumer and ask, 'What is the least amount of friction for the end user to be able to view my content?'\" he said.\nThe concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services. The move toward partnerships among competing media companies, though, represents a clear strategy shift.\n\"It's more of an evolution as the industry matures, and the focus has become on maximizing profits,\" Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin told Yahoo Finance.\nRead more here. \nUgly.\nBrutal 32% sell-off in Roku (ROKU) over the past week (Nasdaq off by 2% roughly \u2026 before those Nvidia earnings) on fears Walmart\u2019s (WMT) Vizio (VZIO) deal will hammer Roku\u2019s account numbers and bottom line. Roku founder Anthony Wood \u2014 who owns 14% of the company \u2014 has seen his net worth tank about $400 million year to date.\nTough being a wealthy person, ain\u2019t it?\nThe question some on the Street are asking is what in the world do you do with Roku\u2019s damaged stock? Digging through equity research on the company, I don\u2019t think anyone has the answer yet!\nBut I believe JPMorgan analyst Cory Carpenter (who downgraded his rating \u2026 today) has a solid view on where things stand:\n\u201cThe Walmart & Vizio tie-up makes Vizio a stronger competitor, and we\u2019d expect Walmart to switch its house TV brand (onn.) from Roku\u2019s operating system to SmartCast. We believe onn. is likely one of Roku\u2019s bigger TV partners after TCL, and for reference Roku has 30+ TV partners globally. However, we\u2019d be surprised to see any material Roku active account impact until perhaps early 2025, with the VZIO acquisition not expected to close until 2Q, after which onn. TVs need to be integrated with VZIO\u2019s SmartCast operating system. We are less worried about Roku Device revenue impact, despite Walmart historically accounting for ~30% of Roku Device revenue (Amazon + Walmart = 59% of 2022 Device revenue; we assume a roughly equal split).\nWe expect Walmart to continue carrying Roku products, and while shelf space could be compromised, in our view other retailers (i.e., Target, Best Buy) are likely to be less keen to promote Walmart-owned Vizio TVs, potentially resulting in improved Roku shelf space at their locations. Said succinctly, we see minimal risk to our 2024 Roku estimates from the Walmart & Vizio tie-up, but we recognize the combination of Roku guiding to decelerating Platform growth and overhangs from Amazon Prime AVOD + Walmart/Vizio integration could limit share upside in the near-term. However, we remain bullish on the secular growth of connected TV and Roku\u2019s longer-term monetization opportunity as ad dollars increasingly shift from linear to streaming, and in our view Roku\u2019s recent pull-back presents a compelling entry point for longer-term investors.\u201d\nThe story in markets on Wednesday won't come until after the closing bell.\nNvidia, the leader of the AI hype cycle, is slated to report quarterly results after the market close and the company has sky-high expectations to meet.\nConsensus projects Nvidia to report earnings per share of $4.60 and revenue of about $20.4 billion. That would mark year-over-year growth of 422% and 236%, respectively.\nThose lofty projections come after Nvidia has consistently topped expectations by a wide margin since its blowout report last May. Nvidia's stock itself has run up more than 200% in the past year and the story behind it has sent the stock market into an AI-driven frenzy.\nThe company's influence has been wide ranging. Its investments in smaller AI plays have caught attention and recently sent shares of SoundHound (SOUN) up nearly 60% in a day. Its overall talk of AI demand has had investors betting on what could be the next AI winner and sent shares of company's like SuperMicro Computer (SMCI) and Palantir (PLTR) roaring.\nBut this could come at a cost, too, if the company fails to meet expectations. And that's what Wall Street will be watching for on Wednesday night.\nInteractive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills that the report could be \"very difficult\" for markets.\n\"If Nvidia misses or just fails to hit a home run ... that can have a gravitational effect on the whole market,\" Sosnick said.\nBig Food is itching to hit the reset button on its narrative with investors, who have soured on the group amid the spread of the Ozempic craze, and consumers balking at still inflationary prices.\nEnter CAGNY, more formally known as the annual Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference.\nThe event is well underway in Boca Raton, Fla., where major packaged food brands with juicy dividend payouts such as PepsiCo (PEP), Coca-Cola (KO), Hershey's (HSY), Conagra Brands (CAG), and Molson Coors (TAP), among others, are presenting.\nWhile the conference is set to run through Friday, I have spotted a few early themes from being here on the ground chatting up sources and sitting in on presentations:\nEyes on volume: As Americans pull back on just how much they're buying because of high prices (see chocolate), the volume recovery is in focus. Execs at both General Mills (GIS) and Conagra were \"hesitant to comment on whether fiscal 2025 (beginning in June) could be a return to growth in line with long-term targets,\" Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer wrote in a note to clients from the event.\nHershey and Mondel\u0113z (MDLZ) called on \"price pack architecture\" with different size and price point offerings, as another potential growth lever. \"We've always capitalized on having different price points, different pack sizes so that there's accessibility for everyone,\"Hershey CEO Michele Buck said.\nInnovation, as well as marketing with new partners, are other key tactics to re-engage consumers. Hershey's, for example, excited the crowd with NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal in attendance to announce a tie-up to \u201cwin\u201d in the gummy segment, the fastest-growing sweets segment. Conagra Brands shared that Dolly Parton's baking line is expanding into frozen shelves.\nThe Potential for deals: M&A chatter is alive and well, not too far removed from Campbell Soup's (CPB) big deal for pasta sauce maker Sovos Brands and J.M. Smucker (SJM) buying Twinkie king Hostess Brands.\nWhile no major announcements were made (yet), many companies are teasing that they're open to the idea of deals, but are waiting for the right company to come along at the right price.\nIt may not be a traditional acquisition one would think, though. Mizuho Securities managing director John Baumgartner told me that similar to Walmart's acquisition of Vizio this week, perhaps you could see \"food staples companies acquiring differentiated tech companies\" to gain a deeper understanding of consumers.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI^) just got more relevant.\nOn Tuesday night S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Amazon (AMZN) will replace Walgreens Boost Alliance (WBA) in the benchmark index. The change is set to go into effect before the market opens on Monday, Feb. 26.\n\"The index needs to stay relevant and reflect the higher end of US markets and Amazon was a natural selection at this point,\" Howard Silverblatt, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live.\nHe added: \"For the average investor it will mean that the index is more reflective of consumer selections at this point in time.\"\nThe swap of tech giant Amazon for Walgreens adds exposure to a variety of areas for the index. Amazon's wide range of industries including cloud computing, artificial intelligence exposure, healthcare, and e-commerce shopping for everyday products far exceeds the reach of the traditional pharmacy brand in Walgreens. This, Silverblatt said, was crucial in influencing the switch.\n\"[Amazon is] developing and giving you exposure to a few other fields where we would\u2019ve wanted to increase on it,\" Silverblatt said. \"But mostly you\u2019re dealing with the consumer, the retail sector, where the bulk of [Amazon] is right now. And that\u2019s a positive because the consumer is the biggest part of the economy.\"\nSilverblatt highlighted that unlike the S&P 500 which rebalances every quarter, the Dow Jones doesn't reshuffle the 30 companies within its index frequently. In the 120-year history of the Dow, there have only been 60 changes, per Silverblatt.\nBut one reason a company can be swapped out of the index is a deterioration in its stock price. Walgreens has seen that recently with shares down nearly 70% over the last five years, while Amazon is up more than 100% in that same time frame.\nUS stocks slipped on Wednesday as investors counted down to high-stakes earnings from AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) and the release of Federal Reserve minutes that could set hopes for interest rates.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped roughly 0.3%, while those on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, down 0.5% on the heels of Tuesday's declines.\nFrom inflation to the opposite of inflation.\nDeflation is starting to creep up into the conference calls and presentations of consumer companies. It\u2019s also starting to impact top-line sales trends as prices, well, deflate.\nWhere we have heard deflation used already this week:\nTuesday's Home Depot Earnings Call: Deflation was mentioned six times on the conference call.\nTuesday's Walmart Earnings Call: Deflation was mentioned two times on the conference call:\nThis is a topic I plan to dive into at 10:40 a.m. ET on Yahoo Finance Live in a chat with the CEO of Mondelez (MDLZ), Dirk Van de Put. The Oreo maker's sales outlook at the CAGNY conference (where Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has been stationed this week, firing off these interesting insights) yesterday suggests it's poised to overcome deflation in 2024, but more to come from our interview soon.\nIf you could only hear the chatter very early in the morning in the Yahoo Finance newsroom on one of the more favorite tickers on our platform, lightning-hot tech play Palo Alto Networks (PANW)...\nThe a.m. team seems to be of the view that Palo Alto Networks is unstoppable (which is probably in line with a lot of you who have traded this name in the past two years). I get it: The stock gained 377% in the past five years before the 22% premarket, post-earnings drubbing today. Palo Alto\u2019s meteoric stock price has been supported by strong rates of growth amid demand for cybersecurity products.\nBut I reminded the team that several things appeared to change fundamentally around Palo Alto Networks last night. And if you put them together, the steep sell-off looks warranted, and the stock may stay capped in the near term until investors get more comfortable.\nFor one, the company\u2019s billings outlook was 10% below consensus expectations. Palo Alto Networks said it\u2019s seeing some federal demand softness. I fancy there is more here, though \u2014 specifically around demand softness from big companies \u2014 akin to what we heard from Cisco (CSCO) last week (it\u2019s also in the cybersecurity business).\nAnd two, Palo Alto Networks surprised the Street via a new pricing strategy. It\u2019s one that could impact profit margins this year and perhaps into 2025.\nThe strategy shift reflects Palo Alto Networks more aggressively trying to gain market share by giving customers short-term access to solutions for \"free.\"\n\"This pricing/bundling/consolidation strategy can weigh on results over the next 12-18 months,\" warned Stifel analyst Adam Borg in a client note this morning.\nWelcome to the show-me story zone, PANW.\n"

        "Text": "By Aditya Soni and Patturaja Murugaboopathy\n(Reuters) -Nvidia briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday, riding on insatiable demand for its chips that made the Silicon Valley firm the pioneer of the generative artificial intelligence boom.\nThe milestone followed another bumper revenue forecast from the chip designer that drove up its market value by $277 billion on Thursday - Wall Street's largest one-day gain on record.\nIts rapid ascent in the past year has led analysts to draw parallels to the picks and shovels providers during the gold rush of 1800s as Nvidia's chips are used by almost all generative AI players from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to Google.\nThat has helped the company vault from $1 trillion to $2 trillion market value in around eight months - the fastest among U.S. companies and in less than half the time it took tech giants Apple and Microsoft.\n\"For AI companies today - the leaders of the sector - what's going to be binding for them is not going to be demand. It's just going to be their capacity to answer the surging demand,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.\nNvidia's shares closed 0.4% higher on Friday, giving it a market value of about $1.97 trillion. They had risen as much as 4.9% to a record high of $823.94 earlier in the session, after a more than 16% jump on Thursday.\nThe shares have surged nearly 60% this year, after more than tripling in value in 2023. The chip designer's 2024 share surge has been crucial to the S&P 500's gains, contributing to more than a quarter of the stock index's rise this year.\nIts latest market-beating forecast of whopping 233% growth in first-quarter revenue helped global markets notch record highs on Thursday.\nThe breakneck growth has drawn analysts and investors from far and wide to Nvidia.\n\"I'm a European fund manager, but I must have had more emails about their results than I've had about any other set. There have been calls, every broker doing 10-minute debriefs, it's been mind boggling,\" said one investor, who declined to be named.\nDespite the share surge, Nvidia's valuation has fallen due to rapid increases in analysts' estimates. It has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 31, down from 49 times a year ago, according to LSEG data.\n\"Leading cloud computing companies plan to boost their capital expenditure to satisfy demand for AI training and inference, and it appears that virtually all this spending will fall into Nvidia's pockets,\" said Brian Colello, a strategist at Morningstar.\n\"We anticipate revenue will rise by a couple of billion each quarter throughout fiscal 2025 for Nvidia as more chip supply comes online.\"\n(Reporting By Aditya Soni, Amruta Khandekar, Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra in Bengaluru and Alun John in London; Additional reporting by Bhanvi SatijaEditing by Barbara Lewis and Arun Koyyur)\n"

        "Author": "  Emma Burleigh ",
        "Text": "Nvidia is having quite a week.\nThe tech company, which specializes in making chips used for AI, added more than $277 billion in market value on Thursday, beating the record for single-day market gains previously held by Meta. The surge followed company earnings on Wednesday, in which Nvidia beat analyst expectations and reported revenues of around $22.1 billion last quarter. It is now the third most valuable company in the U.S., behind Apple and Microsoft.\n\u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,\u201d Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang wrote this week. \u201cDemand is surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations.\u201d\nBut the chipmaker poised to become the most important company in the world has humble beginnings\u2014it was born in a Denny\u2019s restaurant\u2014and its path to success has not been linear. Here are some key leadership lessons from Nvidia and Huang, who embraces fear as a motivator, collaborates with his top managers, and reminds his workers that the company is never more than a month away from shutting down.\nIn navigating the uncertainty of the tech industry, Huang bet on a specific kind of technology\u2014GPUs.\nThat stands for graphics processing unit, which was previously considered a niche technology and mostly used by gamers. Now, it\u2019s critical to AI, with one analyst likening the AI boom to a war, and calling Nvidia the \u201conly arms dealer out there.\u201d\nBut Huang bet on GPUs years before it was clear to everyone else that it would pay off, and stuck to that decision through bad times and good. \u201cWhat he did was recognize that even though there was boom and bust around the GPU, that eventually if there were enough use cases of it, they would offset each other,\u201d Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told Fortune. \n\u201cWhat sets Jensen apart is he\u2019s a wartime CEO,\u201d Munster added. Even when Nvidia is out of favor with investor consensus, and facing near-term setbacks, the company stays \u201ctrue to [its] view of the future.\u201d\nHuang has openly said that if he knew how hard it would be to create and maintain his company, he probably wouldn\u2019t do it again.\n\u201cBuilding a company and building Nvidia turned out to have been a million times harder than I expected it to be, than any of us expected it to be,\u201d Huang said last year on the Acquired podcast.\nHe added that ignorance wasn\u2019t just important for him personally\u2014it\u2019s an important quality for all founders.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s kind of the superpower of an entrepreneur. They don\u2019t know how hard it is. And they only ask themselves: \u2018How hard can it be?\u2019 To this day, I trick my brain into thinking: \u2018How hard can it be?\u2019\u201d he said.\nNvidia had some serious setbacks in its early days.\nThe startup struggled during the dotcom crash in 2002 and the financial crisis in 2008, when demand for its products plummeted.\nWhen everything was going wrong, the company wasn\u2019t shy about making clear to employees how close they were to the brink. In fact, a mantra for Nvidia in its early years was: \u201cOur company is 30 days from going out of business.\u201d\n\u201cWe have the benefit of building the company from the ground up and having not exaggerated circumstances of nearly going out of business a handful of times,\u201d Huang said last November at Harvard Business Review\u2019s virtual Future of Business conference. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to pretend the company is always in peril. The company is always in peril, and we feel it.\u201d\nHuang believes it\u2019s critical for leaders to always remember how close they are to failure. \u201cYou\u2019re always on the way to going out of business,\u201d he said at Columbia Business School\u2019s Digital Future Initiative last fall. \u201cIf you don\u2019t internalize that sensibility, you will go out of business.\u201d\nHuang couldn\u2019t have amassed his AI and chip empire without collaborating with his top lieutenants.\nIn forming a system of governance, Nvidia decided to split decision-making among Huang and his fellow founders, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Even though Malachowksy and Priem worked under Huang\u2019s command, they each had authority and led their own divisions within the company.\n\u201cWe would talk or argue over each other\u2019s decisions, but we would default to the final decision of the person who had the expertise in that area,\u201d Priem told the Wall Street Journal in December last year. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t \u2018agree to disagree.\u2019 The decision terminated any disagreements and became the direction we were going.\u201d\nHuang believes that \u201cfailure must be shared,\u201d and doesn\u2019t shy away from taking ownership and pointing out errors that led to larger companywide problems.\nBack in the early 2000s, Nvidia ran into some trouble with a faulty graphic card that had a loud fan. Instead of firing the product managers, Huang held a meeting where the people involved walked through the mistakes that led to creating a bad product.\nExhibiting one\u2019s failures has become a cultural fixture at Nvidia, but it\u2019s not for everyone.\n\u201cYou can kind of see right away who is going to last here and who is not,\u201d Dwight Diercks, head of software for Nvidia, told The New Yorker last November. \u201cIf someone starts getting defensive, I know they\u2019re not going to make it.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Arsheeya  Bajwa and Max A. Cherney ",
        "Text": "By Arsheeya Bajwa and Max A. Cherney\n(Reuters) -Nvidia on Wednesday forecast a roughly threefold surge in quarterly revenue that handily beat estimates as the company banked on towering demand for its industry-leading artificial-intelligence chips, sending its shares up 10% after-hours.\nThe already-hefty demand for the company's data center chips and graphics processing units (GPUs) continues to grow as firms scramble to expand their AI offerings. Nvidia's silicon dominates the global market for AI chips, where it counts the likes of Microsoft among its customers.\n\"The market was poised to sell the news following Nvidia's earnings, given the sky-high expectations and deteriorating macro conditions,\" Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said. \"However, once again, the company left no doubt that the AI boom is much more than just a stock market narrative, but rather, the most significant bet from corporations worldwide at this moment.\"\nThe late-day stock jump lifted the market capitalization of the Santa Clara, California, company by more than $129 billion, and pushed up the shares of other AI-related companies including chip designer Arm Holdings. Nvidia and other hardware suppliers linked to AI computing added $160 billion of combined stock market value.\nNvidia on Wednesday forecast first-quarter revenue growth of 233%, ahead of Wall Street expectations of 208% growth.\nFor the first three quarters of 2023, Nvidia reported quarterly revenue that beat analyst estimates by between 10% and 20%.\nSome analysts raised questions about how long Nvidia will be able to sustain this pace of growth.\nThe company forecast revenue for the current quarter of $24.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $22.17 billion, according to LSEG data.\nSales at the data center segment - its largest by revenue share, grew 409% to $18.4 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, coming in above estimates of $16.8 billion, according to LSEG data. Data center revenue grew close to 280% in the previous quarter.\nThe AI frontrunner's supply chains, which have been unable to match the soaring demand for Nvidia's chips, are also improving. But CEO Jensen Huang told analysts on a post-earnings conference call that there was no way the company can \"reasonably\" keep up on demand in the short term as it ramps up production.\n\"(The) biggest question on minds for growth is how supply-constrained they remain and what demand looks like over time,\" said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of consulting firm Creative Strategies.\nAnalysts expect major supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) advanced packaging capacity to improve in the first half of the year. This will allow Nvidia to work through the central bottleneck to deliver more chips to customers.\nNvidia reported fourth-quarter revenue of $22.10 billion, beating estimates of $20.62 billion. Adjusted for certain items, fourth-quarter earnings were $5.16 a share, compared with estimates of $4.64 a share, according to LSEG data.\nNvidia expects its first-quarter adjusted gross margin to be 77%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Analysts on average forecast gross margin of 75.6%.\nNvidia stock has gained more than 30% so far this year as it jockeys with Amazon.com and Alphabet for a spot among the most valuable companies.\nAs of Feb. 20, about $30 billion worth of Nvidia shares changed hands daily on average over the past 30 sessions, pulling ahead of electric vehicle maker Tesla, which averaged $22 billion per day over the same period.\nThe AI poster child's revenue has continued to grow despite tightened restrictions on trade with one of its largest markets: China.\nNvidia said in a filing on Wednesday it had received requests from antitrust regulators in France, the European Union, United Kingdom and China over its sale of GPUs and efforts to allocate supply. The company said it expects to receive additional requests from antitrust regulators in the future.\nIn December, U.S. Commerce secretary Gina Raimondo told Reuters that the Biden administration is in discussions with Nvidia about permissible sales of artificial intelligence-chips to China. She said she had spoken with Nvidia's CEO, Huang, and that he was clear that Nvidia will work within the rules the Commerce Department establishes.\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock: Headed to $1,100?",
        "Author": "  Daniel Sparks, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Benefiting from the current boom in artificial intelligence, semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was arguably the hottest stock on Wall Street in 2023. Even more impressive, it's off to an explosive start in 2024 as well. Helped by a big move higher this week, when the company reported a 265% year-over-year growth in fiscal fourth-quarter revenue, shares are now up more than 55% year to date as of this writing.\nBut here's the crazy thing: In response to Nvidia's better-than-expected quarterly results, well over a dozen analysts have raised their 12-month price targets for the growth stock to levels well beyond where shares are trading now. Indeed, several analysts have raised their price targets for the stock to levels of $1,000 or higher.\nLet's see what has some of the most bullish Nvidia analysts on Wall Street so upbeat.\nOne of the most-cited reasons analysts are optimistic about Nvidia stock following its latest earnings report is management's guidance. The company said it expected fiscal first-quarter revenue of about $24 billion -- more than $2 billion more than what the consensus analyst forecast was.\nKeyBanc analyst John Vinh raised his 12-month price target on the stock from $740 to $1,100. His optimism, like analysts at Bernstein and Benchmark (analysts who raised their price target for Nvidia shares to $1,000 after the earnings report), was based on the company's incredible momentum, shown by its explosive sales growth in fiscal Q4 and management's fiscal first-quarter guidance.\nFurther, Vinh praised the company's surging sales in its data center specifically. Data center revenue rose 27% sequentially and a whopping 409% year over year in fiscal Q4.\nIn the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for its data center products was coming from various industries. \"Our Data Center platform is powered by increasingly diverse drivers -- demand for data processing, training, and inference from large cloud-service providers and GPU-specialized ones, as well as from enterprise software and consumer internet companies,\" Jensen explained. Even demand from auto, financial services, and healthcare industries \"are now at the multibillion-dollar level,\" he added.\nCombining a staggeringly good fiscal fourth quarter with management's guidance for fiscal first-quarter revenue to increase by about $16.8 billion year over year, it's easy to see why analysts are upbeat about the stock. But does this mean investors should still be piling in at the stock's current price?\nSure, with Nvidia's earnings per share in fiscal 2024 soaring 586% to $11.93, the stock deserves to trade at a high valuation. Even more, the stock's current price-to-earnings multiple of 65 actually sounds quite reasonable for a stock with earnings growing this fast.\nDespite these factors providing some support for the stock's current valuation, there's one looming concern that should keep investors on their toes: Much of the demand for Nvidia's data center products is driven by surging interest in generative artificial intelligence (AI). Not only is this a new technology that is incredibly difficult to predict, but it's tough to know what sales trends surrounding it will look like after this initial demand boom moderates at some point in the future when the industry for these products matures.\nOn a similar note, competition in the space could prove more adept than expected. This wouldn't be the first time Wall Street underestimates competition. Few would have guessed 20 years ago that Intel would fall from grace and be surpassed in size by multiple competitors.\nBased on Nvidia's guidance for fiscal Q1 revenue and comments from management during the earnings call about some key products remaining supply constrained, there's no sign yet of a pullback in sales on the horizon. But this is a risk investors should be aware of.\nFor this reason, investors should tread carefully when reading about analysts' rosy 12-month price targets for the stock, opting to do their own due diligence and focus on the long term. Sure, maybe the stock is worth its current price tag. But it's OK to stay on the sidelines if you're unsure about the company's future.

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) hasn't been the world's greatest stock to own. Over the past decade, Intel's total return (which includes dividend payments) was about 140%. While that may not seem terrible, the Nasdaq-100's total return is about 465% over that same time frame.\nThat's significant underperformance, and it occurred because Intel has fallen behind on technology. However, Intel may be able to turn it around thanks to a new machine it bought.\nSo, if Intel can return to the top, could it become the next Nvidia and skyrocket higher? Let's find out.\nThe machine that Intel just purchased is a high NA EUV lithography machine made by ASML. Lithography machines allow chipmakers to etch the microscopic patterns on a chip. The distance between these traces determines the size of the chip node. Currently, 3 nanometer (nm) chips are the world's smallest and are only produced by Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung.\nIntel doesn't have 3nm or 5nm chip technology. Instead, the best it has is 7nm. This difference puts its products at a significant disadvantage compared to competitors' products that use these more powerful chips.\nBut Intel's latest purchase of this high NA EUV lithography machine will allow Intel to produce 2nm chips and return to prominence in the semiconductor space.\nHowever, the effect may not be as big as expected.\nIntel is competing with many companies, but primarily Taiwan semiconductors, on this front. Taiwan Semiconductor is a contract chip manufacturer that makes the chips that Intel's competitors (like AMD) use. Taiwan Semiconductor even makes some 3nm chips for Intel because it cannot do so.\nThe relationships are deep within this industry, and if Intel can get its 2nm chips out before others, it may not be enough to supplant itself as king of the semiconductor world. However, this return to prominence may be enough to kick-start momentum in the stock.\nValuing Intel's stock is difficult from the trailing earnings perspective, as it had a few quarters with negative earnings in 2023.\nBut, if we value the stock using forward earnings, we can better understand how the market views Intel.\nAt 31 times earnings, Intel's stock isn't that cheap. But that isn't the full picture. Over the past few years, Intel's profit margins have fallen off a cliff.\nIf Intel can recover to a 25% profit margin and maintain the revenue it generated in 2023, $54.2 billion, it would produce profits of $13.6 billion. Dividing its market cap by this figure yields an optimized price-to-earnings ratio of 13.\nSo, if Intel can return to this level, then the stock looks pretty cheap. But does that mean it could turn into the next Nvidia? I'd say no. Taiwan Semiconductor trades at 19 times forward earnings, so even if Intel improved its margin to previous levels, it doesn't have that far to go before it would be valued the same as Taiwan Semiconductor.\nIntel has a lot to prove, and the stock is already assuming success in revitalizing the company. That's far from certain, making me want to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor rather than Intel.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is losing ground in Tuesday's trading. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price was down 5.9% as of 1 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nWhile there isn't any business-specific news pushing Nvidia lower today, the stock is losing ground due to macroeconomic concerns and underwhelming business results from some major players in the retail space. In particular, the graphics processing unit (GPU) specialist's share price is being pushed lower due to results and commentary from Walmart and Home Depot.\nWhile there might not seem to be much immediate overlap between Nvidia and retail, Walmart and Home Depot are often viewed as bellwethers for the broader economy. Their quarterly results can provide a lot of valuable information about consumer sentiment and overall macroeconomic conditions, and Wall Street didn't like what it saw when the two companies reported earnings before market open this morning.\nWhile Walmart beat earnings expectations and issued encouraging forward guidance, the company's guidance could be taken as a sign that the economy is still running hot and that inflation isn't tapering enough. Home Depot was more explicit with its comments on inflation, stating that it was seeing unfavorable demand trends due to persistent inflation.\nIn addition to raising another red flag that the Federal Reserve's battle with inflation hasn't been won yet, Home Depot's comments could also be interpreted as a negative indicator for the housing market. Stocks don't trade in a vacuum, and Nvidia's valuation is feeling that today.\nEven with today's pullback, Nvidia stock has risen roughly 218% over the last year. The company's explosive gains have largely been powered by surging AI-driven demand for its high-end GPUs, but expectations that the Fed will begin cutting interest rates in the near future have also played a major part in the rally.\nIf it looks like the central banking authority will push rate cuts further out, it could dampen bullish momentum for Nvidia. But in the ultra-near term, investors have a crucial event to narrow in on.\nNvidia is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter earnings results after the market closes tomorrow, and it's poised to be one of the most important stock market events of 2024. With its last update, the company guided for sales of roughly $20 billion -- suggesting growth of nearly 231%. While recent demand trends suggest there's a good chance the GPU leader will beat that guidance, the explosive run-up for its stock means that performance will be under the microscope -- and investors will be expecting perfection.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Nvidia added over $129 billion in stock market value late on Wednesday after the chipmaker's hotly anticipated quarterly report beat estimates and sparked gains in other AI hardware stocks.\nNvidia's stock jumped almost 8% after its quarterly outlook exceeded analysts' estimates, along with its January-quarter revenue and profits.\nNvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build artificial intelligence into their products and services. This made the Santa Clara, California company's outlook a major test of whether Wall Street's AI-fueled rally is likely to continue or potentially reverse.\nFollowing Nvidia's report, server component supplier Super Micro Computer jumped almost 6%, while Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices rose 3%.\nBroadcom and Marvell Technology, two more chipmakers benefiting from the surge in AI computing, rose over 2% each in extended trade.\nArm Holding added nearly 6%, now up more than 160% from the $51 price set in its initial public offering in September.\nNvidia forecast current-quarter revenue of $24.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. That was well above the $22.17 billion predicted by analysts, according to LSEG data.\nThe company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $22.10 billion, beating estimates of $20.62 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.16 vs $4.64 expected by analysts. Net income surged 769% from a year ago to $12.285 billion.\nWorries that Nvidia's quarterly report might not meet Wall Street's high expectations in recent days knocked its stock down almost 9% from record highs. Its late-day surge to $724 on Wednesday still leaves its short of its $739 record high close on Feb. 14.\nIncluding Wednesday's after-hours gain, Nvidia's stock has climbed over 40% in 2024 after more than tripling last year. In recent sessions, Nvidia has jockeyed with Amazon.com and Alphabet for a spot as Wall Street's third-most valuable company.\nNvidia has also recently replaced Tesla as Wall Street's most traded stock by value.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)\n"

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Over the past year, there have been few better stocks to own than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), as it's up 400% since the start of 2023. And year to date, it's already up nearly 50%.\nUnfortunately, I missed those gains after selling my shares last July. However, it's never too late to admit you're wrong and consider buying back in. But at its current stock price, many people might question this decision. So, why am I considering buying now? Read on to find out.\nNvidia's primary products are GPUs (graphics processing units). This piece of computing hardware is tailor-made to handle complex computing tasks. Originally designed to process gaming graphics, its uses have been expanded to tasks like drug discovery, engineering simulations, mining cryptocurrency, and training AI models.\nArtificial intelligence has been the latest demand driver for Nvidia, and its results are spectacular. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 30), revenue rose an incredible 206% year over year to $18.1 billion. But the company isn't done as management expects fourth-quarter revenue to more than triple year over year to about $20 billion.\nGrowth of this magnitude at a company as large as Nvidia is almost unparalleled, making the stock such an incredible story. Recently, Nvidia surpassed Amazon and Alphabet as the third-largest U.S. company by market cap.\nAfter missing out on much of the stock's meteoric rise, I believe now is the time to correct that mistake.\nLooking back on last year, I realize I misjudged the market opportunity for Nvidia's products. I figured that once the initial onslaught of AI-driven GPU demand was over, revenue would fall off a cliff. This is exactly what happened in 2019 and 2022 when the cryptocurrency market crashed and demand for GPUs dropped.\nI still believe this drop will happen, but it won't occur nearly as quickly as I expected. The demand for Nvidia's GPUs is unbelievable. Take Tesla, for example. After they spent $300 million on its Dojo computer filled with 10,000 H100 GPUs, I figured that would be the only one they'd build.\nBut Tesla announced it would spend another $500 million on a second Dojo computer powered by Nvidia GPUs at its Buffalo, NY, plant. CEO Elon Musk also mentioned on the company's Q4 conference call that they have plans for additional Dojo computers beyond that.\nClearly, the demand is greater than I anticipated, and I want to get back in on that, especially since it will be a multiyear trend. Precedence Research estimates the global GPU market will reach about $773 billion in 2032, up from $42 billion in 2022. With Nvidia's trailing-12-month revenue total of $45 billion, it has a significant foothold in this growing market.\nBut is now really the best time? It isn't as I should've done this months ago, but it's never too late to flip your stance on a generational company. Many investors overlooked Amazon or Netflix in the early years but still made a lot of money off those stocks despite being late to the party.\nNvidia is likely to offer a similar opportunity today, assuming you can stomach the stock's price tag, which trades for nearly 100 times earnings.\nBut when looking forward with analysts' earnings projections over the next 12 months, the valuation is much more palatable. Microsoft trades at a comparable 35 times forward earnings estimates.\nWhile my position in Nvidia will likely be fairly small to start, it will be enough skin in the game to monitor the company and ensure I'm capturing the gains of what's looking to be one of the most important companies this decade. While I've missed the first big move, there's room for much more upside if the AI market is as massive as some predict.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jane Thier ",
        "Text": "Hailed as a once-in-a-generation tech visionary, Jensen Huang, CEO of chip manufacturer Nvidia, can add a new feather to his cap: He\u2019s the 24th-richest man in the world. It\u2019s hard to miss the news about his company, the semiconductor manufacturer that has just leapfrogged Google in market cap.\nThe company\u2019s stock has soared 409% since last year. After its year-end earnings call on Wednesday, Nvidia\u2019s value rose $250 billion in a single day, topping Meta\u2019s $197 billion rise from earlier this month as the largest such daily increase. On its year-end earnings call Wednesday, Nvidia crushed analyst expectations, setting off a frenzy among Wall Street investors and Silicon Valley analysts. Nvidia reported $22.1 billion revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, roughly $1.7 billion more than expected.\nGoldman Sachs just called Nvidia \u201cthe most important stock on planet earth.\u201d But who is the man leading the runaway trillion-dollar firm in his signature moto leather jacket?\nHuang, who turned 61 earlier this week, was born in Taiwan and, at age 9, was sent with his brother to live with an uncle in Tacoma. The following year, Huang moved once more, to rural Oneida, Ky., where he lived in an all-boys dorm at the Oneida Baptist Institute\u2014a religious reform academy his uncle mistakenly believed was a boarding school.\nHuang\u2019s parents eventually joined him and his brother in the U.S., and the family settled outside Portland, Ore., where Huang went to high school, played competitive tennis, and graduated two years early\u2014at age 16. According to a New Yorker profile from 2023, Huang briefly worked as a dishwasher at Denny\u2019s. He earned his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University, and then a master\u2019s in the same field from Stanford.\nAfter several years working in engineering, including as a microprocessor designer, Huang cofounded Nvidia in 1993 at another roadside Denny\u2019s in East San Jose\u2014while eating, not serving. Huang was 30 at the time, and he and his cofounders, friends and fellow microchip designers Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, had just $40,000 in the bank between them, but they were armed with a keen sense of what was to come in computing.\n\u201cWe believed this model of computing could solve problems that general-purpose computing fundamentally couldn\u2019t,\u201d Huang told Fortune in 2017. \u201cWe also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don\u2019t happen very often. Video games were our killer app\u2014a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems.\u201d\nNvidia quickly grabbed $20 million in VC funding, including from Sequoia Capital, and he\u2019s the rare tech founder who\u2019s remained at the helm of his company steadily since its inception. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking about the same story for 15 years,\u201d Huang said in 2017, to reporter Andrew Nusca. \u201cI\u2019ve barely had to change my slides.\u201d\nHuang\u2019s approachability and decency has probably added to his longevity at Nvidia. In 2010, Huang told the New York Times he defines good leaders based on authenticity. \u201cThey don\u2019t dress like a CEO because they think that\u2019s what CEOs dress like. They don\u2019t talk like CEOs because that\u2019s the way they think CEOs talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t conduct their meetings and expect people to treat them like CEOs because that\u2019s the way they think CEOs are supposed to be treated. They are just who they are.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s business has been turbocharged by the AI boom that\u2019s taken over the global tech industry. The company makes many of the critical chips that provide the computing power needed to run the models that underpin AI tools. Nvidia provides the building blocks for what some consider to be among the most significant developments in the history of tech\u2014and it joined the trillion-dollar club last June.\nNvidia\u2019s historic stock rally is perhaps the example par excellence of the old investing adage that to make money in a gold rush one should sell shovels and pickaxes. Nvidia is especially lucky in that it has a seemingly insurmountable lead on the other proverbial shovel-makers.\nThen there\u2019s Huang himself. Per Fortune\u2019s\u00a02017 profile, the billionaire doesn\u2019t even keep a desk\u2014much less a corner office\u2014opting instead to roam around his building, working in any number of conference rooms he passes. He also has a large arm tattoo resembling his company\u2019s logo, which he got in the mid-2000s on a dare from his staff once the company\u2019s stock price hit $100. (Tattoos and leather jackets are welcome at Nvidia\u2019s offices, where staff tenure is unusually long and bonds are tight-knit.)\nNvidia stock is inching closer to $800 these days, but don\u2019t expect another tattoo on its formidable cofounder-CEO. As he told Fortune\u2019s Nusca in 2017: Getting the company logo on his shoulder made him \u201ccry like a baby.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations.\nThese are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, February 21, 2024, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.\nWith that let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $22.1 billion was up 22% sequentially and up to 265% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $20 billion. For fiscal 2024, revenue was $60.9 billion and up 126% from the prior year. Starting with data center. Data center revenue for the fiscal 2024 year was $47.5 billion, more than tripling from the prior year. The world has reached the tipping point of new computing era. The $1 trillion installed base of data center infrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. As Moore's Law slows while computing demand continues to skyrocket, companies may accelerate every workload possible to drive future improvement in performance, TCO and energy efficiency.\nAt the same time, companies have started to build the next generation of modern data centers, what we refer to as AI factories, purpose built to refine raw data and produce valuable intelligence in the era of generative AI. In the fourth quarter, data center revenue of $18.4 billion was a record, up 27% sequentially and up 409% year-over-year, driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue tripled from last year. We are delighted that supply of Hopper architecture products is improving. Demand for Hopper remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply. Fourth quarter data center growth was driven by both training and inference of generative AI and large language models across a broad set of industries, use cases and regions.\nThe versatility and leading performance of our data center platform enables a high return on investment for many use cases, including AI training and inference, data processing and a broad range of CUDA accelerated workloads. We estimate in the past year approximately 40% of data center revenue was for AI inference. Building and deploying AI solutions has reached virtually every industry. Many companies across industries are training and operating their AI models and services at scale, enterprises across NVIDIA AI infrastructure through cloud providers, including hyperscales, GPU specialized and private clouds or on-premise. NVIDIA's computing stack extends seamlessly across cloud and on-premise environments, allowing customers to deploy with a multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud strategy.\nIn the fourth quarter, large cloud providers represented more than half of our data center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external public cloud customers. Microsoft recently noted that more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers, contributing to GitHub revenue growth accelerating to 40% year-over-year. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 adoption grew faster in its first two months than the two previous major Microsoft 365 enterprise suite releases did. Consumer internet companies have been early adopters of AI and represent one of our largest customer categories. Companies from search to e-commerce, social media, news and video services and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems.\nThese AI investments are generating a strong return by improving customer engagement, ad conversation and click-throughs rates. Meta in its latest quarter cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser performance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue. In addition, consumer internet companies are investing in generative AI to support content creators, advertisers and customers through automation tools for content and ad creation, online product descriptions and AI shopping assistance. Enterprise software companies are applying generative AI to help customers realize productivity gains. Early customers we've partnered with for both training and inference of generative AI are already seeing notable commercial success.\nServiceNow's generative AI products in their latest quarter drove their largest ever net new annual contract value contribution of any new product family release. We are working with many other leading AI and enterprise software platforms as well, including Adobe, Databricks, Getty Images, SAP and Snowflake. The field of foundation of large-language models is thriving. Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI are leading with continued amazing breakthrough in generative AI. Exciting companies like Adept, AI21, Character.ai, Cohere, Mistral, Perplexity and Runway are building platforms to serve enterprises and creators. New startups are creating LLMs to serve the specific languages, cultures and customs of the world many regions.\nAnd others are creating foundation models to address entirely different industries like Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Generate:Biomedicines for biology. These companies are driving demand for NVIDIA AI infrastructure through hyperscale or GPU specialized cloud providers. Just this morning, we announced that we've collaborated with Google to optimize its state-of-the art new Gemma language models to accelerate their inference performance on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud data center and PC. One of the most notable trends over the past year is the significant adoption of AI by enterprises across the industry verticals such as automotive, healthcare and financial services. NVIDIA offers multiple application frameworks to help companies adopt AI in vertical domains such as autonomous driving, drug discovery, low latency machine learning for fraud detection or robotics, leveraging our full stack accelerated computing platform.\nWe estimate the data center revenue contribution of the automotive vertical through the cloud or on-prem exceeded $1 billion last year. NVIDIA DRIVE infrastructure solutions includes systems and software for the development of autonomous driving, including data ingestion, creation, labeling and AI training, plus validation through simulation. Almost 80 vehicle manufacturers across global OEMs, new energy vehicles, trucking, robotaxi and Tier 1 suppliers are using NVIDIA's AI infrastructure to train LLMs and other AI models for automated driving and AI cockpit applications. And in fact, nearly every automotive company working on AI is working with NVIDIA. As AV algorithms move to video transformers and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA's automotive data center processing demand to grow significantly.\nIn healthcare, digital biology and generative AI are helping to reinvent drug discovery, surgery, medical imaging and wearable devices. We have built deep domain expertise in healthcare over the past decade, creating the NVIDIA Clara healthcare platform and NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI service to develop, customize and deploy AI foundation models for computer-aided drug discovery. BioNeMo features a growing collection of pre-trained Biomolecular AI models that can be applied to the end-to-end drug discovery processes. We announced Recursion is making available for their proprietary AI model through BioNeMo for the drug discovery ecosystem. In financial services, customers are using AI for a growing set of use cases from trading and risk management to customer service and fraud detection.\nFor example, American Express improved fraud detection accuracy by 6% using NVIDIA AI. Shifting to our data center revenue by geography. Growth was strong across all regions, except for China where our data center revenue declined significantly following the U.S. government export control regulations imposed in October. Although we have not received licenses from the U.S. government to ship restricted products to China, we have started shipping alternatives that don't require a license for the China market. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our data center revenue in Q4. And we expect it to stay in a similar range in the first-quarter. In regions outside of the U.S. and China, sovereign AI has become an additional demand driver.\nCountries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of large-language models in their own language, on domestic data and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems. From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue was driven by our Hopper architecture along with InfiniBand networking. Together, they have emerged as the de-facto standard for accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. We are on track to ramp H200 with initial shipments in the second quarter. Demand is strong as H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100. Networking exceeded a $13 billion annualized revenue run rate. Our end-to-end networking solutions define modern AI data centers. Our Quantum InfiniBand solutions grew more than 5x year on year.\nNVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand is the standard for the highest performance AI-dedicated infrastructures. We are now entering the ethernet networking space with the launch of our new Spectrum-X end-to-end offering designed for an AI-optimized networking for the data center. Spectrum-X introduces new technologies over ethernet, that are purpose built for AI. Technologies incorporated in our Spectrum switch, BlueField DPU and software stack deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional ethernet. Leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Super Micro, with their global sales channels, are partnering with us to expand our AI solution to enterprises worldwide. We are on track to ship Spectrum-X this quarter.\nWe also made great progress with our software and services offerings, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion in Q4. We announced that NVIDIA DGX Cloud will expand its list of partners to include Amazon's AWS, joining Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud. DGX Cloud is used for NVIDIA's own AI R&D and custom model development as well as NVIDIA developers. It brings the CUDA ecosystem to NVIDIA CSP partners. Okay, moving to gaming. Gaming revenue was $2.87 billion, was flat sequentially and up 56% year on year, better than our outlook on solid consumer demand for NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs during the holidays. Fiscal year revenue of $10.45 billion was up 15%. At CES, we announced our GeForce RTX 40 Super Series family of GPUs. Starting at $599, they deliver incredible gaming performance and generative AI capabilities.\nSales are off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Tensor cores and the GPUs deliver up to 836 AI tops, perfect for powering AI for gaming, creating an everyday productivity. The rich software stack we offer with our RTX GPUs further accelerates AI. With our DLSS technologies, seven out of eight pixels can be AI generated, resulting up to 4x faster ray tracing and better image quality. And with the Tensor RT LLM for Windows, our open-source library that accelerates inference performance for the latest large-language models generative AI can run up to 5X faster on RTX AI PCs. At CES, we also announced a wave of new RTX 40 Series AI laptops from every major OEMs. These bring high-performance gaming and AI capabilities to a wide range of form factors, including 14 inch and thin and light laptops.\nWith up to 686 tops of AI performance, these next-generation AI PCs increase generative AI performance by up to 60x, making them the best-performing AI PC platforms. At CES, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine microservices, which allowed developers to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital avatars. ACE won several Best of CES 2024 awards. NVIDIA has an end-to-end platform for building and deploying generative AI applications for RTX PCs and workstations. This includes libraries, SDKs, tools and services developers can incorporate into their generative AI workloads. NVIDIA is fueling the next wave of generative AI applications coming to the PC. With over 100 million RTX PCs in the installed-base and over 500 AI-enabled PC applications and games, we are on our way.\nMoving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $463 million was up 11% sequentially and up 105% year on year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.55 billion was up 1%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a rich mix of RTX Ada architecture GPUs continuing to ramp. Enterprises are refreshing their workstations to support generative AI-related workloads, such as data preparation, LLM fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation. These key industrial verticals driving demand include manufacturing, automotive and robotics. The automotive industry has also been an early adopter of NVIDIA Omniverse as it seeks to digitize work flows from design to build, simulate, operate and experience their factories and cars. At CES, we announced that creative partners and developers including Brickland, WPP and ZeroLight are building Omniverse-powered car configurators.\nLeading automakers like LOTUS are adopting the technology to bring new levels of personalization, realism and interactivity to the car buying experience. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $281 million, up 8% sequentially and down 4% year on year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.09 billion was up 21%, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time on continued adoption of the NVIDIA DRIVE platform by automakers. NVIDIA DRIVE Orin is the AI car computer of choice for software-defined AV fleets. Its successor, NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, designed for vision transformers often -- offers more AI performance and integrates a wide range of intelligent capabilities into a single AI compute platform, including autonomous driving and parking, driver and passenger monitoring and AI cockpit functionality and will be available next year.\nThere were several automotive customer announcements this quarter, Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, ZEEKR, the premium EV subsidiary of Geely and Jeremy Xiaomi EV all announced new vehicles built on NVIDIA. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded sequentially to 76% and non-GAAP gross margins to 76.7% on strong data center growth and mix. Our gross margins in Q4 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher compute and infrastructure investments and employee growth. In Q4, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. During fiscal year '24, we utilized cash of $9.9 billion towards shareholder returns, including $9.5 billion in share repurchases.\nLet me turn to the outlook for the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in data center and proviz, partially offset by seasonal decline in gaming. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 76.3% and 77% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis-points. Similar to Q4, Q1 gross margins are benefiting from favorable component costs. Beyond Q1, for the remainder of the year, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion respectively. Fiscal year 2025 GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-30% range as we continue to invest in the large opportunities ahead of us.\nGAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $250 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1% excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the Morgan Stanley Technology and Media and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on March 4 and the TD Cowen's 44th Annual Healthcare Conference in Boston on March 5.

        "Author": "  Saqib Iqbal Ahmed ",
        "Text": "By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders in the U.S. equity options market are betting Nvidia's upcoming earnings report could spur a massive move in the shares of the world's most dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker.\nNvidia, up about 50% this year, could see its shares swing by about 11% in either direction following its quarterly results on Feb. 21, according to data from options analytics service ORATS. That's the largest expected move options traders have priced in ahead of Nvidia's earnings over the last three years and well above the stock's actual average earnings move of 6.7% over that period, ORATS founder Matt Amberson said.\nWith Nvidia's market capitalization at $1.8 trillion, a move of that size would make for a potential swing in market value of about $200 billion. That would be greater than the market capitalization of chipmaker Intel Corp and larger than the respective market values of about 90% of S&P 500 constituents.\nOn Thursday, more than 750,000 Nvidia options had changed hands by 1 p.m. (1800 GMT), making it the second most actively traded single stock name in the options market.\nDespite the sizeable run-up in the stock, demand for upside options bets on Nvidia remained intact, with one measure of sentiment - the stock's 90-day 25 delta call skew - near a five- year high, according to a Susquehanna analysis.\n\"The elevated call skew tells us that investors still see the potential for significant upside despite the move already made and that there is significant demand for upside exposure as some who may be fearful of the high volatility turn to upside calls for lower-risk exposure,\" Christopher Jacobson, a strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group, said.\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia overtook Google-parent Alphabet as the third most valuable U.S. company.\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $4.56 a share, and a rise in quarterly revenue to $20.378 billion from $6.05 billion a year ago, according to the mean estimate from 33 analysts, based on LSEG data.\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Leslie Adler)\n"

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp experienced a record-breaking surge in market value in January, the largest monthly increase ever, driven by heightened optimism around artificial intelligence (AI), positive analyst projections, and the company's announcement of expanded AI offerings.\nThe world's most valuable chipmaker saw its market value expand by an unprecedented $296.52 billion to about $1.52 trillion, surpassing its previous high of $248.23 billion in gains seen in May 2023.\nLast month, Nvidia's stock climbed to new heights following the announcement of new desktop graphics processors and advancements in AI-related components and software.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft, the world's most valuable company, also enjoyed a robust increase in market value, adding $159.36 billion, largely attributed to the rising demand for its Azure cloud service.\nThe tech giant on Tuesday, reported higher than estimated quarterly profit and revenue, although investors turned cautious about its rising costs that are expected to \"increase materially\" on a sequential basis.\nAs of Wednesday, Microsoft's market value stood at $2.95 trillion, outstripping Apple Inc's $2.85 trillion in market capital.\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms saw a strengthening in its market value last month, crossing back over the $1 trillion mark for the first time since September 2021.\nMeta's stock surged over 14% to a record high $451 after the bell on Thursday, elevating its market capitalization by $148 billion to $1.16 trillion after the Facebook owner delivered a 25% jump in revenue to $40.1 billion for the December quarter and declared its first-ever dividend.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Tesla Inc emerged as the weakest performer among the top 20 global companies by market cap, losing about 24.5% of its value over the last month due to concerns over slowing growth. CEO Elon Musk has cautioned that sales growth would be \"notably lower\" this year despite recent price reductions.\nAdditonally, Saudi Arabian Oil Co saw a 7.3% fall in its market value.\n(Reporting By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates)\n"

In premarket trading on Thursday, the stock rose as much as 13%.\nLast week, we noted some Wall Street analysts have worked overtime to properly analogize a story that is both a facsimile and the genuine object \u2014 a stock around which the entire market and its favorite meme, AI, revolves, and yet which has delivered the goods now for four quarters running.\nAnd while all the perspective some investors will need to understand Nvidia\u2019s import to this rally comes from its stock price (up 300% since the start of 2023), Wednesday's fundamental update offers helpful \u2014 and more impressive \u2014 landmarks as well.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, its just-completed fiscal year, Nvidia\u2019s data center segment, which realizes most of the demand for its high-end chips that power AI applications, saw revenue tally $18.4 billion. In the same quarter a year ago, the entire company\u2019s revenue totaled $6.1 billion.\nNet income in its entire fiscal 2023 tallied $8.4 billion; in the fourth quarter of 2023, net income reached $12.8 billion. Its annual profits in 2024 reached $32.3 billion.\nAnd in its fiscal 2024, Nvidia's revenue grew 126% from the prior year; in the fourth quarter, revenue was up 265% from the prior-year period. Net income on an annual basis rose 286%; in the fourth quarter, this measure of profits was up 491% from the prior year period.\nIn its fiscal 2023, which ended in January 2023, Nvidia reported company-wide revenue of $27 billion. On Wednesday, Nvidia said revenue in the current quarter \u2014 the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025 \u2014 revenue should total $24 billion, plus or minus 2%.\nMeaning the amount of money coming in the front door per quarter is now about 90% of what came in for the entire year just one year ago.\nThe market cap gains and returns longer-term bulls have realized in Nvidia are gaudy, no doubt. But the results underpinning this hype more than hold their own.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Title": "Beamr and NVIDIA team up to accelerate adoption of the newest video standard - AV1",
        "Author": "  Beamr Imaging Ltd. ",
        "Text": "Herzliya Israel, Feb. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Beamr Imaging Ltd. (NASDAQ: BMR), a leader in video optimization technology and solutions, today announced that it will present its joint research relating to automated video modernization with NVIDIA Corporation at the ACM Mile-High-Video 2024 conference, being held in Denver, Colorado from February 11-14, 2024.\nBacked by tech giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft, AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) is an efficient emerging video format. However, it is facing slow adoption due to the highly complex and costly processes of upgrading existing video libraries in growing markets like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, streaming \u00a0and user-generated content. Today Beamr and NVIDIA are going to jointly present for the first time a proposed solution to this challenge, at the ACM Mile-High-Video 2024 conference.\nWhile video usage is growing at an exponential pace, most videos today are still based on a 20 year old format (AVC / H.264), that existed before smartphones, AI, 85\" screens and high-speed internet. The research presented today will highlight the Beamr-NVIDIA collaboration in facilitating the transition to AV1 adoption at scale. Beamr and NVIDIA will describe an automated process to transfer video libraries and repositories into the emerging format. This is done while securing video quality with an optimized bitrate and using NVIDIA\u2019s hardware.\nBeamr CTO, Tamar Shoham, who will present the research at the conference, explained: \u201cUntil today, adopting the upgraded video standard was a complex transition for two reasons - one, the new standard requires significantly more compute power and therefore comes at a very high cost; and two, the new standard requires a steep learning curve as it is difficult to figure out how much added compression can be applied without sacrificing video quality, which results in a lot of uncertainty during the process\u201d.\nShoham added: \u201cBeamr technology powered by NVIDIA\u2019s encoder (NVENC) addresses these two challenges by using NVIDIA\u2019s hardware accelerated AV1 encoding with performance that is equal, and even superior, to previous formats. It is done at the same cost thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s focus on the adoption of the latest standards. We also made the conversion to modern formats, or \u2018codecs\u2019, such as AV1, fully automated, so that going from an AVC format to a smaller, more efficient AV1 format is seamless and does not introduce any quality degradation\u201d.\nBeamr\u2019s technology that enables efficient format modernization is Content-Adaptive-Bitrate, which is backed by 53 patents and the fruit of more than a decade of research and development. The ACM Mile-High-Video conference is a flagship video formats and streaming event that is geared towards practicing engineers in areas related to media compression and streaming. This event, held annually in Denver, is organized by engineers and researchers from both industry and academia.\nAs previously announced, Beamr is scheduled to launch on February 20, 2024 its new video cloud service on Amazon\u2019s AWS and powered by NVIDIA, that will simplify video processing and make it accessible and affordable to everyone.

Back in 2017, Nvidia reported a stake in Zebra Medical, an Israeli-based startup focused on using artificial intelligence to read medical images.

        "Title": "Nvidia earnings highlight shortened trading week: What to know this week",
        "Author": "  Josh Schafer    \u00b7 Reporter",
        "Text": "Stocks nearly recovered after a hotter-than-expected inflation report sent the market lower on Tuesday.\nFor the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed down 0.4% but cracked a fresh record-high close on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.1% for the week. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 1.3%.\nMarkets were closed on Monday for the Presidents' Day holiday.\nWith few economic events on the calendar expected to severely sway investor sentiment, the earnings report from AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday after the market close will take center stage in the week ahead. Reports from Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Moderna (MRNA), and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) will also be in focus throughout the week.\nThe growing economic consensus has hit a bump in the road.\nOver the past several months, a string of stronger-than-expected data had many investors embracing a possible soft landing, in which inflation would fall to the Federal Reserve's 2% target without a severe economic downturn.\nRecent data over the past week has challenged that narrative. Both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) showed prices increased more than economists projected in the last month. And the January retail sales report showed sales dropped by more than economists had expected. In other words, neither inflation nor consumer spending\u00a0improved.\n\"While January data are often noisy, the inflation data do suggest that disinflation took two steps back in January,\" Bank of America US economists Stephen Juneau and Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\nJuneau and Gapen wrote that the January inflation data vindicates the Fed's \"wait-and-see approach\" to cutting interest rates and that they agree with the new market consensus that the first interest rate cut will come in June rather than March or May.\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nThis marks a stark shift in sentiment on Fed rate cuts. Investors are now pricing in a roughly 35% chance the first cut comes in May, per the CME FedWatch Tool. A month ago, investors had placed a 97% chance that the first cut would come by the end of the May meeting.\nPerhaps the most important earnings report of the fourth quarter reporting season is slated to hit the tape on Wednesday after the closing bell. The chipmaker's lead in AI has propelled it to the third-highest market cap in the world, only trailing Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\nSince a blowout earnings report last May when Nvidia topped Wall Street's estimates for revenue guidance by more than 50%, the company has consistently topped analysts' expectations. And many on Wall Street expect another blowout quarter. Consensus projects Nvidia to report earnings per share of $4.60 and revenue of $20.36 billion. That would mark year-over-year growth of 422% and 236%, respectively.\nFor a stock that has already rallied almost 50% this year, the risk for investors lies in if the company's string of hefty beats finally ends. And given Nvidia's outsized weighting in the major indexes and its value in the AI story, it could be a risk to the broader market too.\nInteractive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills that the report could be \"very difficult\" for markets.\n\"If Nvidia misses or just fails to hit a home run ... that can have a gravitational effect on the whole market,\" Sosnick said.\nNvidia's earnings are a reminder that while the recent string of economic data provided some challenges to the soft-landing narrative, the overall market story has changed little in recent weeks. Stocks have stomached unsatisfying news, with the S&P 500 hitting fresh highs despite a shift in investor expectations from the rate cut cycle starting in March to the cycle beginning in June.\nAI stocks are still shooting higher as enthusiasm remains plentiful for the new technology (see the 150% one-month gain in Super Micro Computer (SMCI) for the latest example). And a look under the surface shows that the fundamental story for stocks has held up too.\nThe latest data from FactSet, released on Friday, shows that with nearly 80% of S&P 500 companies done reporting earnings, the index is pacing for earnings growth of 3.2% in the fourth quarter. That number has been moving up steadily in recent weeks as more companies report.\nAs we've been noting, earnings beats have come across sectors too, which many believe could lead to a broadening of market returns beyond just a few top tech stocks later this year. Recent research from Truist co-CIO Keith Lerner pointed out that, since\u00a0the market's recent bottom in late October, a broadening has been underway.\n\"The market rally that we have seen since October is broader than many investors give it credit for,\" Lerner wrote in a note to clients on Thursday night.\nThis played out in the most recent week of trading with the equal-weighted S&P 500 (RSP) and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) \u2014 two indexes commonly referenced by market strategists who think the stock market rally will extend beyond the few stocks currently leading the charge. Both rose more than 0.7%. The S&P 500 fell about 0.4%.\nThese signs of a market shift come as Renaissance Macro head of economics Neil Dutta pointed out several times this week that the soft-landing market narrative still remains in play. And that is largely because the macro conversation hasn't changed, Dutta added.\n\"We\u2019re still talking about an economy that is growing reasonably well and a central bank that is thinking about when it will cut rates,\" Dutta wrote. \"A recalibration of policy is still likely this year.\"\nMarkets closed for the Presidents' Day holiday.\nEarnings: Barclays (BCS), Caesars Entertainment (CZR), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Home Depot (HD), KBR (KBR), Medtronic (MDT), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Teladoc Health (TDOC), Toll Brothers (TOL), Walmart (WMT)\nEconomic news: Philadelphia Fed Non-Manufacturing Activity, February (-3.7 previously); Leading index, January (-0.3% expected, -0.1% prior)\nWednesday \nEarnings: Nvidia (NVDA), DutchBros (BROS), Etsy (ETSY), HSBC (HSBC), Lucid (LCID), Marathon Oil (MRO), Rivian (RIVN), Suncor Energy (SU), Wingstop (WING)\nEconomic news: MBA mortgage applications, February 16 (-2.3% previously); FOMC meeting minutes from Jan. 31 meeting\nThursday\nEarnings: Booking Holdings (BKNG), Block (SQ), Carvana (CVNA), Intuit (INTU), LiveNation (LYV), Moderna (MRNA), Nikola (NKLA), Wayfair (W)\nEconomic news: Chicago Fed Nat Activity Index, January (-0.15 previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Feb. 17 (212,000 previously); S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, February preliminary (50.1 expected, 50.7 previously); S&P Global US services PMI, February preliminary (52.0 expected, 52.5 previously); S&P Global US composite PMI, February preliminary (52.0); Existing home sales month-over-month, January (5.0% expected, -1% previously)\nEarnings: Lamar (LAMR), Warner Bros.

Shares of Nvidia surged 5% to a new record high of $661.19 on Friday.\n\"Early days, but results from top US cloud customers suggest solid motivation for spending in GenAI,\" Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said.\nThis week's earnings results from Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet revealed that AI spending is top of mind for the mega-cap tech giants as they seek to solidify their standing in the fast-growing industry. And that's great news for Nvidia, who develops and sells the GPU chips that enable most AI technologies.\nIt's worth noting that the mega-cap tech giants are leading the pack in AI spend, but there are plenty of other companies that are just starting to map out and implement their AI roadmap, and that should generate demand for Nvidia's AI offerings for years to come.\n\"Enterprise genAI adoption has yet to kick off and become more material in CY25, with Nvidia benefitting from its widespread availability on public clouds, and unique partnerships with ServiceNow, SAP, VMWare, Dell, HPE and others,\" Arya said.\nArya said he expects Nvidia to deliver a measured revenue beat when it reports earnings later this month, as well as solid earnings growth. Longer-term, Arya sees Nvidia generating more than $40 in earnings per share power.\n\"Nvidia is one of the rare large-cap tech stocks trading at 31x/25x CY24/25 PE, below its 45% CY23-25 [estimated] EPS CAGR. We see a path to $40 in EPS power in CY27E at $160 billion+ in accelerator TAM and much higher (maybe 2x or $80/share) if the TAM were to hit AMD's (likely very optimistic) $400 billion level,\" Arya said.\nNvidia's earnings power comes from its domination of the market, with Arya estimating that the company will maintain a 90% share of the AI training market and a more than 50% share of the AI inference market.\n\"Nvidia's diversity of SKUs between ~$1.2k to over $30k, and hence will not leave any part of the compute market uncovered,\" Arya said.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

The recognition of sovereign AI capabilities is global.\u201d\nAt the time of the interview, Huang was in Canada, which itself is home to a number of academic institutions that have significantly contributed to breakthroughs in the type of generative AI systems that power tools such as OpenAI\u2019s popular ChatGPT. The country now finds itself with a growing need for the supercomputers necessary to capitalize on the work of its academics, he said.\nHuang, who co-founded the chip designer Nvidia, has been talking for months about the need for countries and their companies to keep precious data and the intelligence that can be extracted from it local. Such a national approach to the AI boom stands to drive an expansion of data centers that would need Nvidia\u2019s know-how and hardware.\nThe world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker is estimated to have doubled its sales in the fiscal year, driven by the AI spending of its biggest customers such as Microsoft Corp. Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. Huang now wants to expand his customer base by persuading corporations and government agencies to build their own infrastructure.\n\u201cThe vast majority of the computing market has been in the US, and to a much smaller degree, China,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the very first time, because of generative AI computer technology, it\u2019s going to impact literally every single country. So some of the markets will be quite large and global.\u201d\nNvidia, which has become Wall Street\u2019s favorite bet on AI, has managed to exceed analysts\u2019 expectations for the past few quarters of earnings, and it may need to find new markets to maintain that streak. Other tech companies that have been associated with the AI boom over the past year, such as chip-making rival Advanced Micro Device Inc., have posted earnings and outlooks this quarter that disappointed investors.\nNvidia may prove the exception. It\u2019s arguably the only tech company that has demonstrated significant revenue growth from AI that has already transformed the chip supplier from a niche player to the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom. Analysts are projecting that the surge in demand for Nvidia\u2019s products will turn it into the biggest company by revenue in the chip industry as early as 2025.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Story Elon Musk Doesn\u2019t Want to Talk About\nThe Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

Peer Texas Instruments\u2019 soft outlook and revenue contraction may be an indicator for Analog Devices.\nSynopsys (SNPS US) \u2014 closing in on a $34 billion deal to buy Ansys \u2014 should post healthy sales growth, BI said, as its customers ramp up R&D and AI spending.\nRivian\u2019s (RIVN US) vehicle deliveries fell short of analysts expectations, highlighting the automaker\u2019s challenges amid supply-chain issues and lower electric vehicle demand. Lucid\u2019s (LCID US) quarterly deliveries beat estimates. That meant it reached an annual target of 8,000 to 8,500 unit, though that was cut twice during 2023 from an original 14,000 forecast as it struggled to bounce back from supply issues and inconsistent output at the Arizona plant.\nTrip.com (TCOM US) probably tripled its adjusted earnings per share, jumping to 2.34 yuan (33 US cents), as demand for travel in China exceeds pre-pandemic levels, BI said. A doubling in revenue will have helped offset higher sales and marketing expenses.\nEtsy\u2019s (ETSY US) gross merchandise sales are set to fall 1.5% as holiday shopping only partly offset weak consumer spending, BI said. Temu\u2019s push into US markets might increase Etsy\u2019s customer-acquisition costs, Jefferies analyst said.\nThursday: Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s (KDP US) adjusted EPS is seen rising 8.2%, as US sales of its refreshment beverages grows on higher prices and volume, though sales of US coffee probably fell. Moderating input and operating costs will improve margins, BI said.\nBlock\u2019s (SQ US) Bitcoin revenue probably grew 33% last quarter, after shrinking a year earlier. Still, its initial 2024 gross profit outlook will probably miss expectations if it underperformed, Jefferies said.\nWeaker demand for food delivery and mobility will take Grab (GRAB US) results lower than previously expected, Barclays said. Watch for comments on revived merger talks with GoTo Group.\nModerna (MRNA US) reported preliminary Covid-19 vaccine revenue of $6.1 billion for 2023, ahead of its outlook. Overall 2024 sales, including contribution from its RSV vaccine, will shrink to around $4 billion this year before growing in 2025, TD Cowen said.\nCarvana\u2019s (CVNA US) used vehicle revenue entered its sixth consecutive quarter of contraction as profitability and sustainability of virtual pre-owned vehicle sales remain a concern, BI said.\nIntuit (INTU US) may miss on consumer group sales as $60 million to $65 million of revenue shifts to the fiscal third quarter following a delayed start in the US Internal Revenue Service\u2019s tax filing season, Mizuho said.\nBooking Holdings\u2019 (BKNG US) revenue is projected to rise 17%. The company benefited from demand in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region where hotel spending remained resilient, Jefferies analysts said.\nFriday: Warner Bros Discovery\u2019s (WBD US) adjusted Ebitda probably rose 7.7%, consensus shows. Its licensing-first strategy \u2014 streaming shows like Young Sheldon on Netflix \u2014 boosted profitability, BI said. The company might detail its plans to launch a sports streaming service with Fox and Disney, which comes as its TV ad revenue is expected to continue falling.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nA24\u2019s Risky Hollywood Moment\nPlug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World\u2019s Biggest EV Market\nHow Capital One\u2019s $35 Billion Discover Merger Could Affect Consumers\nHow Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign Robocalls\nUS Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) delivered a sizzling return of nearly 240% last year. Believe it or not, the stock is on pace to generate gains that aren't too far behind that mark in 2024.\nThanks to its share price soaring close to 50% so far this year, Nvidia now sports a market cap of nearly $1.83 trillion. Will the chipmaker beat Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) in joining Apple and Microsoft in the $2 trillion club?\nMicrosoft currently stands at the top of the mountain with a market cap of over $3 trillion. Apple isn't too far behind, with its market cap of more than $2.8 trillion. For now, these are the only stocks with market caps above $2 trillion.\nNvidia only needs to rise another 10% or so to join Apple and Microsoft in the $2 trillion club. However, Alphabet and Amazon are nipping at Nvidia's heels with market caps of $1.82 trillion and $1.77 trillion, respectively.\nIt's a neck-and-neck race at this point. The momentum is certainly on Nvidia's side, though. Its stock performance trounced both Alphabet and Amazon in 2023 and has continued to do so thus far this year.\nThe primary potential catalyst that could push Nvidia's market cap above the $2 trillion threshold is the strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). Surging interest in generative AI is providing an ongoing tailwind for GPU demand.\nBut Alphabet and Amazon also benefit from the generative AI boom. The two companies provide cloud services with a variety of tools to help customers build generative AI apps.\nWall Street appears to be most confident about Amazon's prospects of joining the $2 trillion club soon. The average 12-month price target for Amazon reflects an upside potential of 21%. Of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in February, 43 rated the stock as a buy or strong buy.\nAnalysts are also upbeat about Alphabet. The consensus price target for the stock is 12% above the current share price. Thirty-eight of the 43 analysts surveyed by LSEG this month rate Alphabet as a buy or strong buy.\nWhat about Nvidia? There's still some enthusiasm about the chip stock on Wall Street. However, the overall mood isn't nearly as positive compared to the sentiment for Amazon and Alphabet.\nThe average 12-month price target for Nvidia is 7% below the current share price. While 21 of the 38 analysts surveyed by LSEG in February rate Nvidia as a buy or strong buy, another 15 recommend holding the stock. One analyst rates the stock as an underperform. One analyst recommends that investors sell their Nvidia shares.\nThis is a big swing from January, when all but five analysts rated Nvidia as a buy or a strong buy. It's probably fair to say that many on Wall Street now think that Nvidia's share price has gotten ahead of itself, even with the company's tremendous growth prospects.\nI'm confident that the market caps of Amazon, Alphabet, and Nvidia will top $2 trillion over time. Which stock will join the $2 trillion club first? My hunch is that it will indeed be Nvidia.\nYes, the limited availability of GPUs due to strong demand is motivating customers to look to other AI chipmakers, such as AMD\u00a0and to develop their own chips. Nvidia's meteoric trajectory since early last year won't be sustainable indefinitely. However, it doesn't have to be for the stock to beat Amazon and Alphabet over the near term.\nAll three stocks need close to the same percentage gain to hit $2 trillion. Nvidia has the strongest tailwind of the three right now. Perhaps just as important, though, is that the company is likely to report its next quarterly results a day or two before Amazon and Alphabet do. Positive news could push Nvidia over the threshold.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Lewis Krauskopf and Noel Randewich\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -No single stock has embodied the U.S. market\u2019s artificial intelligence fervor as much as Nvidia Corp, leaving Wall Street tied to the fluctuations of its volatile shares.\nThe semiconductor company, whose chips are considered the gold standard in the AI industry, forecast fiscal first-quarter revenue above estimates after the market closed on Wednesday in one of the most highly anticipated earnings releases in recent memory.\nGiven the company\u2019s status as a bellwether of the AI industry and its heavy weighting in U.S. indexes, the way investors react to its earnings report in coming days could offer a glimpse of whether risk appetite continues to thrive in a stock market that has cruised to record highs despite climbing Treasury yields and fading hopes that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates in coming months.\n\u201cThe response to the numbers could be seen as a referendum on the market itself,\u201d said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at GraniteShares, which manages exchange traded funds tied to Nvidia\u2019s performance. \u201cIf Nvidia beats expectations and the stock still falls, that will tell us that people are anxious.\u201d\nThe company's shares were up around 12% in pre-market trading on Thursday, bringing the company closer to a $2 trillion market valuation.\nNvidia shares tripled in 2023 and are up nearly 40% this year on growing excitement over the business potential of artificial intelligence. That\u2019s made it a standout performer among the so-called Magnificent Seven group of growth and technology stocks that have been the market\u2019s key drivers over the past year.\nNvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion mark for market capitalization in the middle of last year. Earlier this month, it passed Amazon and Alphabet to become the third-largest U.S. company by market value, although its recent pullback put the company back in fifth.\nThe company's heftier market value has given it significant sway in key indexes, including the S&P 500. As of Tuesday's close, Nvidia's soaring shares have accounted for more than a quarter of the 4% gain in the index, which hit a record high earlier this month.\nNvidia's rise comes as the company has put up big increases in revenue and profit amid an artificial intelligence boom that has fueled demand for its chips. Revenue more than doubled to over $60 billion in its latest fiscal year, while net income soared to nearly $30 billion.\nRapid increases in analysts' earnings estimates means its forward earnings valuation has fallen even as its share price has exploded higher.\nThe company traded at 31 times forward earnings ahead of Wednesday's report, compared to 47 times earnings a year ago, LSEG data showed.\nNvidia options late Wednesday were pricing a swing of about 10% in either direction in the two trading days following its results, according to data from options analytics service Trade Alert. A 10% move in Nvidia's nearly $1.7 trillion in market value would be roughly equivalent to the current market cap of Qualcomm or Comcast.\nNvidia's shares soared 14% and 24% in the day following its quarterly reports in February and May last year, but the stock's reaction has been more tepid in recent quarters.\nOptions wagers on where Nvidia shares could go in the next few days ran the gamut, with some traders targeting a drop below $500 by the end of this week while others are betting on a move to $1,300 by Friday, a near double. Nvidia\u2019s shares closed at $674.72 on Wednesday.\nWhile Nvidia has been the poster child for AI, it has not been the only stock to benefit from excitement over the technology. Shares of companies such as Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings have jumped in recent weeks, although both stocks have pulled back recently.\nEven beyond the semiconductor and technology fields, companies across industries have playing up their exposure to AI. Artificial intelligence has been mentioned on 38% of S&P 500 quarterly conference calls in January and February, a slightly higher percentage than during the June quarter, when AI took hold as a prominent industry and market theme.\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Noel Randewich; additional reporting by Suzanne McGee and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Stephen Coates)\n"

        "Text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Nvidia Corp., which has seen its value skyrocket over the past year thanks to soaring demand for its graphics chips used for artificial intelligence, posted stronger-than-expected results Wednesday for its latest quarter, with its revenue more than tripling from a year earlier.\nNvidia reported revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter that ended Jan. 28 of $22.1 billion, up from $6.05 billion.\nThe company based in Santa Clara, California, earned $12.29 billion, compared to a profit of $1.41 billion a year ago.\nAdjusted for one-time items, Nvidia earned $5.16 a share in the latest quarter, that topped Wall Street forecasts for $4.59 per share, based on analysts surveyed by FactSet Research. Analysts had expected revenue of $20.4 billion for the period that concluded the company\u2019s fiscal year.\nThe company's specialized chips are key components that help power different forms of artificial intelligence, including the latest generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.\n\u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, in a statement. \u201cDemand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\u201d\nNvidia carved out an early lead in the hardware and software needed to tailor its technology to AI applications, partly because Huang began to nudge the company into what was then seen as a still half-baked technology more than a decade ago. It also makes chips for gaming and cars.\nHuang looked at ways that Nvidia chipsets known as graphics processing units might be tweaked for AI-related applications to expand beyond their early inroads in video gaming.\n\u201cAnother blockbuster quarter from Nvidia raises the question of how long its soaring performance will last,\" said Insider Intelligence analyst Jacob Bourne. \u201cIt has a massive lead in the growing global AI chip sector but can\u2019t rest on its laurels.\u201d\nBourne said Nvidia faces a number of challenges, including broader economic uncertainty, tech giants\u2019 drive to make their own AI chips and emerging rivals. But he said the company's market strength, for the near future, is \u201cdurable\u201d\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia expects revenue of about $24 billion. Analysts are currently expecting Nvidia to post revenue of $22.2 billion for the February-April period. The company expects \u201ccontinued growth\u201d to 2025 and beyond.\nThe company said its data center revenue grew in all regions except China, where the U.S. government has imposed export regulations.\n\u201cAlthough we have not received licenses from the U.S. government to ship restricted products to China, we have started shipping alternatives that don\u2019t require a license for the China market,\u201d Huang said in a conference call with analysts.\nNvidia relies heavily on the world's biggest maker of computer chips, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, to churn out the chips that Nvidia designs.\nTaiwan\u2019s Taiex benchmark index last week jumped 3% to a record high, buoyed by a surge in TSMC's share price.\nThe leap came after Morgan Stanley analysts raised their price target on Nvidia's stock to $750 from $603, citing an increase in demand for AI chips.\n\u201cGenerative AI has kicked off a whole new investment cycle to build the next $1 trillion of infrastructure of AI generation factories,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWe believe these two trends will drive a doubling of the world\u2019s data center infrastructure installed base in the next five years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions.\u201d\nNvidia's shares jumped 7.5%, to $726 in after-hours trading.\n"

The market will be sharply focusing on the potential for the stock to sustain the face-melting rally. In fact, the rally has been so hot that Goldman even called it \"the most important stock on planet earth\" as options traders are betting on a move in either direction of 11%.\n\"Nvidia is currently trading at 90x P/E and Q4 earnings expectations have been adjusted higher recently,\" QCP said. For comparison, Amazon.com (AMZN) currently trades at 52.4x and Tesla (TSLA) at 57.7x price-to-earning (P/E) ratio, according to FactSet data.\nWith such a high valuation, the margin of error is very slim. \"At these valuation multiples and high expectations on earnings, any disappointment could see a sell-off. That would certainly put a drag on U.S. equities and crypto prices as well,\" QCP continued.\nAnother crypto sub-sector that could see a volatile trading session from Nvidia's earnings is the artificial intelligence (AI) -related tokens such as Ocean Protocol\u2019s OCEAN and Fetch.AI\u2019s FET.

        "Title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 10 Years?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Predicting where any company will be 10 years in the future isn't an easy task. A decade ago, there were no companies with $1 trillion market caps -- the largest came in at around $500 billion. Now, there are six companies with 13-digit valuations in the U.S.\nPredicting a company's future becomes even more difficult when it's involved with an explosive trend such as artificial intelligence (AI). While there may be a risk of a bubble forming, significant business results disprove that view. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is at the forefront of this discussion, as its products are critical in this area. However, the company saw a dramatic rise in its stock price, and there's now a lot of optimism baked into it.\nSo where will Nvidia be in a decade?\nNvidia's GPUs (graphics processing units) are the best-in-class hardware for supporting AI workloads. GPUs were originally made to provide the fast processing required by video game graphics, but their ability to efficiently handle intense calculations made them popular for running other workloads like drug discovery, engineering simulations, cryptocurrency mining, and now, AI model creation.\nInterest in AI grew rapidly in the past year and a half as businesses and consumers became intrigued by generative AI, and rising demand meant a need for supercomputers and server installations capable of processing these workloads. Fortunately for companies like Nvidia, these supercomputers must feature thousands of GPUs. Given that Nvidia's flagship H100 GPUs are rumored to cost around $30,000 apiece, that market is a significant revenue stream for it.\nThis new demand caused Nvidia's revenue to skyrocket over the past few quarters.\nHowever, the growth is far from over. For the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2024 (which ended in late January), management guided for revenues of about $20 billion. When Nvidia reports its Q4 results on Feb. 21, all eyes will be on its next revenue guidance as investors seek assurance that it can continue growing at these incredible rates. That's because there are a lot of expectations baked into the stock price.\nMuch of Nvidia's rise is based on its anticipated future growth. The company's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is an absurdly high 95. However, when its forward earnings ratio (based on analysts' growth estimates) of 35 is considered, the stock doesn't look nearly as expensive.\nThat's not to say 35 times earnings is necessarily cheap, but when one considers, for example, that tech giant Microsoft trades for 36 times forward earnings, Nvidia's valuation doesn't seem so bad.\nBut the elephant in the room is that Nvidia is a hardware company. Unlike software, which is largely sold as a service and a regular subscription, hardware is usually a one-time purchase to be used until it's necessary to replace or upgrade. With the recent rush to build out AI computing infrastructure, there's been a significant diversion from the expected growth path of the GPU market.\nLate last year, Precedence Research (a market research firm) estimated the GPU market would have around $56 billion in revenue during 2023. If Nvidia hits its guidance for Q4, it will have produced revenues greater than that in just three quarters. Does that mean Precedence was wrong? Not necessarily. The market could be pulling forward some of the revenue predicted for future years.\nBut another thing Precedence predicts is that there will be revenue of $773 billion in GPU sales by 2032. That's drastically higher than current sales and shows a massive market for GPUs that hasn't been tapped yet.\nSo, what will happen to Nvidia over the next decade? I'd predict a few things:\nNvidia's annual revenues will fall at some point because of initial demand fulfillment.\nRevenues will ramp up again once new GPU technology is invented or product demand increases.\nNow, I don't know when the first prediction will happen. Still, with many experts predicting GPU usage will only increase thanks to the rise of cloud computing and other data-driven approaches, it makes sense to buy shares of Nvidia, even if they are expensive.\nWhile Nvidia's stock will likely nosedive at some point, over the long term, the growth is there for it to be a market-crushing stock. You'll have to hold onto it through those difficult times.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Arsheeya  Bajwa ",
        "Text": "By Arsheeya Bajwa\n(Reuters) -Nvidia is set to post a more than three-fold surge in its fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday, the same as in the previous quarter, as demand for its chips that dominate the market for artificial intelligence outstrips supply.\nBut even that remarkable growth may disappoint some investors who have become accustomed to Nvidia blasting past analyst expectations, which has led to a bull run in its stock since the beginning of 2023.\nNvidia recently left Amazon.com behind to become the fourth most valuable U.S. company, and is now head-to-head with Alphabet for the No. 3 spot. The chip designer's shares had gained nearly 50% this year, up to their last close.\nHowever, Nvidia's shares fell more than 5% on Tuesday, as concerns surrounding the AI poster child living up to Wall Street's towering expectations sparked a selloff.\nIf the losses hold, it could be the biggest percentage drop in more than eight months for Nvidia.\nThat rally could ease if Nvidia warns again that U.S. curbs on selling its chips to China are hurting its business and visibility into long-term prospects, and if it is unable to sort out supply shortages at its chip contractor TSMC.\nIn response to the newest round of U.S. export rules, Nvidia has come up with new products for the Chinese market, but there is a risk that those chips will also be banned like its first round of China market chips.\n\"There's an understanding that China is going to go its own way,\" said Angus Shillington, a portfolio manager at wealth manager VanEck, referring to the country's efforts to make its own chips. VanEck's Semiconductor ETF held more than $151 million worth of Nvidia stock as of Jan. 31.\nChina accounted for more than a fifth of Nvidia's revenue in the third quarter.\nUltimately though, red-hot demand for Nvidia's graphic processing units - which are powering an AI upgrade at massive datacenters around the world - could trump all concerns.\n\"Given the hot demand situation, Nvidia should comfortably be able to replace China demand with other governments as well as large enterprises,\" Tejas Dessai, an analyst at exchange traded fund (ETF) provider Global X told Reuters. Global X's Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF held roughly $500 million worth of Nvidia stock as of Feb. 13.\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company is also likely to forecast on Wednesday another 200% year-over-year increase in revenue for its first quarter ending April, according to LSEG data.\nMorgan Stanley analysts said in a note they expect Nvidia to top that expectation by 25%, thanks to aggressive orders, and Goldman Sachs said it expects major supplier TSMC to increase chip packaging capacity through the first half of the year.\nDemand for advanced packaging was very strong and TSMC couldn't offer enough capacity to support customers, a bottleneck that would continue into next year, the Taiwanese company said in January. It is planning to invest nearly $2.87 billion in a plant, as it looks to double its packaging capacity.\n\"The reason why (Nvidia) can't beat (estimates) by more is the capacity needs. That is what's holding them back. Otherwise there could have been a larger beat,\" said Inge Heydorn, a partner at investment firm G.P. Bullhound, which holds Nvidia shares.\nLast May, Nvidia stunned investors by forecasting revenue for the May-July period nearly 54% above analysts' expectations, igniting a rally in AI-facing stocks. Since then, the company's forecasts have surprised analysts, but to a smaller degree.\nVanEck's Shillington said he does not expect that magnitude of a surprise, and that Nvidia would be foolish to rely on China demand.\nFor the first three quarters of 2023, Nvidia had reported quarterly revenue that beat analysts' estimates by between 10% and 20%.\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh)\n"

But the performance of Nvidia and other Big Tech has pushed Fed worries into the background.\n\"The concentration is so intense right now on Big Tech, in particular on Nvidia, that it's looking passed that,\" he said.\nNvidia had pulled up other Big Tech and growth stocks in previous sessions, as investors traded the AI play.

        "Text": "Over any meaningful time span, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a blockbuster investment. It's up almost 1,800% over the last five years, and it has more than tripled in the past year alone, fueled by investors' excitement for artificial intelligence (AI).\nThere's good reason to believe Nvidia is a top AI stock. Management attributes its surging revenue to AI-related products and services. To illustrate how strong demand is, the company expects to report revenue of $20 billion in its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. That would be a 231% year-over-year increase -- simply astounding for a company of this size.\nAI is the top investment trend right now, and Nvidia stock is one of the most popular ways to ride the trend higher. However, for its part, the company is buying shares of five other AI companies.\nThis interesting development made the news on Feb. 14 with Nvidia's first 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This form is for institutional investment managers to report their stock holdings.\nAccording to its 13F, Nvidia has a stock portfolio worth $230 million, and these are the AI stocks it's been buying.\nNvidia's 13F shows it owns only five stocks, but all five have a connection to AI in some capacity. Here's a quick overview of each company, from the largest investment down to the smallest.\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) licenses its AI semiconductor chip designs to other companies, and this business is in high demand right now. Nvidia tried to acquire Arm back in 2020 but finally called it off in 2022 after pushback from regulators. Now, it will look to benefit as an investor. This is Nvidia's largest stock position, valued at $147 million as of the SEC filing.\nNext in Nvidia's portfolio is Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RXRX). This early-stage biotechnology company is using AI models to process genetic data and find new drugs. It's an idea that could be game-changing for the medical field, which is why the stock has also caught the attention of growth investor Cathie Wood.\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) offers an AI voice assistant that's similar to what's already offered by major tech companies. However, SoundHound AI believes its AI is more capable of understanding normal language. And based on its growing customer list, there seems to be support for management's claim.\nOf Nvidia's stocks, investors might want to disregard TuSimple Holdings, considering it's delisting from the Nasdaq. That said, this company has an AI angle as well -- it's working to enable autonomous driving for trucking companies.\nFinally, Nano-X Imaging (NASDAQ: NNOX) -- or just Nanox -- is Nvidia's smallest stock position. This company hopes to transition the world to a new digital X-ray technology. It intends to use AI to go through these digital images and find patterns that doctors might overlook, leading to better outcomes for patients.\nWhen it comes to AI stocks, I personally believe the trend, as a whole, is overhyped. And stock market history is littered with past trends that eventually fizzled out. Therefore, investors need to be discerning.\nThat said, I believe AI can unlock a lot of possibilities when it comes to the medical field. This is why I'm particularly intrigued with Nvidia's investments in Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox.\nFull disclaimer before I go any further: I am not a medical expert in the slightest. I'm just a regular investor on the outside looking in. Investing great Warren Buffett says to stay inside of your circle of competence. And fellow great Peter Lynch says to invest in what you know. Medical stocks aren't that for me.\nHowever, I do know enough to understand datasets are enormous in this field, and processing large amounts of data is where AI really shines.\nConsider one of Recursion Pharmaceutical's newest partnerships as an example. In the third quarter of 2023, it partnered with Tempus to gain access to 20 additional petabytes (over 20,000,000 gigabytes) of oncology data. It now has a staggering 50 petabytes at its disposal for cancer research. And to process this much information, the company will keep working with Nvidia to make its BioHive-1 supercomputer more powerful.\nNanox only has a limited number of medical devices in operation right now. But when it went public in 2020, the company hoped to eventually deploy 15,000 machines, which would make more than 150 monthly digital scans each.\nNanox is still a long way from that goal, and it may never get there. But hitting its goals would represent nearly 2.3 million medical images per month. This could quickly become the largest medical-imaging dataset in the world, and the company will need to use AI to make any sort of discovery.\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox are looking to use AI to unlock important medical breakthroughs by using enormous medical datasets. This is why I say these two stocks have enticing upside.\nThat said, both Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox have meager revenue streams and enormous losses, as the chart below shows.\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox are very high-risk stocks, and investing in them should not be taken lightly. Both have an elevated chance of failing, and Nvidia's investment in them shouldn't be viewed as something that guarantees success.\nIt's exciting to think about what could happen if things go right, and AI leads these two companies to major breakthroughs. Investors just need to keep their emotions in check, fully recognizing the risks that come with these stocks.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By David Randall and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Next week\u2019s earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia could prove a gut check for one of the market\u2019s hottest names, and for the artificial intelligence fever that has helped power gains for U.S. stocks in recent months.\nExcitement over the business potential of AI has boosted Nvidia\u2019s shares by more than 46% since Jan. 1. Its $570 billion increase in market capitalization is more than triple the market value of Intel. Shares of Nvidia, whose chips are considered the gold standard in the AI industry, surged nearly 240% in 2023.\nThe chipmaker's gains have accounted for more than a quarter of the S&P 500's increase this year. The benchmark index is up nearly 5% year-to-date, after optimism about AI helped drive the index up 24% in 2023.\nNow the third most valuable company on Wall Street after Apple and Microsoft, Nvidia has also become a bellwether for the artificial intelligence industry. Other AI-focused stocks have surged this year, including Super Micro Computer Inc, which is up 182% year-to-date, and Arm Holdings, up nearly 71%.\n\"When people say that the market is doing well this year, they really mean that tech is doing well, and Nvidia is at the core of that,\" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services. \"There is excitement within AI and if that optimism is not fulfilled by earnings then you could see that reverberate quickly and weigh on sentiment.\"\nNvidia will release quarterly earnings results on Feb. 21. Wall Street expects earnings of $4.56 a share, and a rise in quarterly revenue to $20.378 billion from $6.05 billion a year ago, according to the mean estimate from 33 analysts, based on LSEG data.\nGiven the company's size and its importance to the AI story, Nvidia\u2019s results could be pivotal for market sentiment, said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Capital.\n\"Every time you get a big stock market rally there\u2019s a favorite stock that leads it,\" said Landis, who regrets selling his shares in Nvidia last year. \"It's hard not to look at Nvidia and see \u2026 that's driving the psychology of the overall market.\"\nNot surprisingly, traders are bracing for big moves in the company\u2019s shares. Nvidia options are pricing a swing of about 11% in either direction following its results, according to data from options analytics service ORATS.\nThat's the largest expected move options traders have priced ahead of Nvidia's earnings over the last three years and well above the stock's average earnings move of 6.7% over that period, ORATS data showed.\nTom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said positive updates to Nvidia's corporate outlook could fuel more AI optimism and extend a market rally that has been concentrated in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap stocks, of which Nvidia is a member.\nShares of Meta Platforms, another member of the group, have surged 34% this year while Apple\u2019s have fallen by 5%. Shares of Tesla have tumbled nearly 20% after the electric car maker warned of \"notably lower\" sales growth this year and shrinking margins.\n\"Right now investors are rewarding visibility into earnings growth and that keys up well for more gains for Nvidia,\" Hainlin said.\nOn the other hand, investors may use a less-than-stellar report as an opportunity to take profits.\nRyuta Makino, research analyst at Gabelli Funds, believes investor enthusiasm for Nvidia is so high that its shares could fall by at least 10% if the company simply meets expectations, without exceeding them.\nHe remains bullish on Nvidia due to rising capital expenditures from customers such as Amazon.com and Microsoft into their cloud businesses, which rely on the company\u2019s chips.\nA disappointing report from Nvidia could also exacerbate concerns over crowding in the market\u2019s largest stocks, said Michael Purves, head of Tallbacken Capital Advisors.\nOverall, investors have their highest allocation to the tech sector since August 2020, according to fund managers in the latest survey conducted by BofA Global Research.\n\"This is the pillar of the growth for the index today, but at some point the gas tank will go empty,\" Purves said.\n(Reporting by David Randall and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and David Gregorio)\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s examine NVIDIA\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n See our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nNVIDIA is currently expensive based on our price multiple model, where we look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, we\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock\u2019s cash flows. We find that NVIDIA\u2019s ratio of 65.18x is above its peer average of 30.93x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Semiconductor industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that NVIDIA\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. NVIDIA's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NVDA\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NVDA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nSo while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing NVIDIA at this point in time.

Nvidia reports quarterly results on Feb. 21.\nMorgan Stanley raised its price target to $750 from $603, with analyst Joseph Moore writing in a client note that \"AI demand continues to surge\".\nAfter Nvidia's stock more than tripled in 2023, it has already become the U.S. stock market's fifth most valuable company.\nNvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build AI into their products and services, with Meta Platforms and other Big Tech companies buying billions of dollars worth of Nvidia's graphics processors.\nAI developers face months-long waiting lists to use Nvidia's processors through cloud-computing providers, although those wait times are coming down, Morgan Stanley's Moore wrote.\nThe last time Nvidia was more valuable than Amazon was in 2002, when they were each worth under $6 billion.\nAn early leader in the AI race, Microsoft in January overtook Apple to become the world's most valuable company. Behind that duo, among the world's most valuable publicly-listed companies, are state oil giant Saudi Aramco, Alphabet and Amazon.\nSaudi Aramco has a $2-trillion market capitalization, making it the world's third most valuable publicly listed company, according to LSEG data.

HSBC analyst Frank Lee raised their price target on Nvidia to $880, representing 11.6% upside from the stock's latest closing price as of this writing.\nThe stock is already up 238% over the last 12 months, but that performance comes on top of a decade's worth of market-thumping returns. The company's growth story continues to get better as the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips is lighting a fire underneath Nvidia's data center business.\nNvidia's revenue for its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter climbed 265% year over year. CEO Jensen Huang said, \"Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations.\"\nThe data center segment, specifically, raked in $18.4 billion during the quarter to make up 83% of total revenue.\nHowever, Nvidia's growth is starting to decelerate, which could limit the stock's gains this year. The $22.1 billion top line for fiscal Q4 was up 22% from the previous quarter, compared to sequential growth of 34% in fiscal Q3. As the year progresses, Nvidia's growth may slow further as year-over-year comparisons become more challenging against last year's triple-digit growth rates.\nHowever, analyst Frank Lee still likes Nvidia's growth opportunity. This partly stems from Nvidia's focus on emerging markets, where management expects another wave of demand to come from governments around the world as nations invest in their sovereign AI infrastructure.\nNvidia grew earnings per share by 54% annually over the last five years, and the consensus estimate projects earnings will grow 36% annually over the next five years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nano-X Imaging Could Be Teaming Up With Nvidia, and Its Stock Is Flying. Can It Continue?",
        "Author": "  Alex Carchidi, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "According to a recent regulatory filing, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) now owns a stake in Nano-X Imaging (NASDAQ: NNOX), a small Israeli medical device company that makes X-ray machines. While the investment was modest, that didn't prevent investors from reacting ebulliently to the news -- Nano-X's shares skyrocketed more than 50% the following day.\nDoes Nvidia's involvement have the potential to be transformative for the smaller business, and is it possible that there's more upside in store for shareholders? Or is the market missing something?\nIt's worth noting that Nvidia's shares of Nano-X are worth a grand total of $379,856, which is just a smidgen in comparison to its market cap of around $572 million. So at first glance, it looks like the market is massively overreacting since it's difficult to imagine precisely what the company could even do with such a small investment. Still, appreciating the context is key to understanding why the market isn't entirely over the top with its aggressive bidding.\nIn case you aren't familiar, Nano-X's business model is a bit unique. Rather than manufacture its low-cost X-ray machines and sell them to customers, it doles out hardware with the goal of capturing revenue each time a customer performs a scan. In the U.S., each scan costs on the order of $30, but it's likely cheaper elsewhere. The company has also decided to experiment with its model somewhat in the U.S., where it charges customers a small amount for equipment and installation as well as for scans.\nThe advantage of this model is that the business can access a much larger market -- many healthcare systems in developing countries and rural areas of the U.S. could certainly make use of an X-ray machine, but they often lack the capital to buy them.\nRecognizing that its target customers are unlikely to have many spare radiologists if they don't already have basic imaging technology on hand, the company is also developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems and human-provided teleradiology services to remotely analyze the images generated by its hardware.\nThat could be one explanation for Nvidia's interest as the company is keen to invest in many different AI applications. Pairing Nvidia's acumen with AI together with Nano-X's widely distributed scanning hardware -- if that's what the two companies have in mind -- could thus be beneficial for both organizations, especially if it allows Nano-X to one day offer a product that eliminates the need for radiologists entirely. Neither company has made any comment.\nIn 2017, Nvidia invested in another Israeli company, Zebra Medical, which was focused on using AI for interpreting scan imagery. Then in 2021, Nano-X purchased Zebra Medical using its stock, so Nvidia received its shares. It's very possible that the only reason it reported its stake in February was that the size of its investment portfolio grew to be worth more than $100 million, which is the cutoff after which it'd be required to make a regulatory filing.\nNvidia is a powerful company, but it isn't yet a kingmaker, at least not in the medical device industry. It's true that Nano-X could stand to increase the size of its addressable market by bolstering its offerings with Nvidia's AI capabilities if that were to take place. But that elides a more significant issue for investors, namely that Nano-X has not proven its business model is actually viable.\nWhile the Nanox.Arc, its x-ray platform, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), its commercial global launch has been much slower than anticipated. According to the Q3 report, its quarterly revenue of $2.5 million in 2023 was barely higher than 2022's haul of $2.4 million in the same quarter.\nWhat's more, $2.2 million of its third-quarter revenue was from its teleradiology services, as was all of its revenue a year prior. Only $99,000 was derived from equipment sales and installation fees. Likewise, while its AI solution for analyzing scans of people's livers has the stamp of regulatory approval, it has not driven faster revenue growth yet either.\nIn other words, this business is not yet profitable or self-sustaining, and so it is a risky investment. Without the core economic proposition validated -- that it can make more money on scans than it costs to produce and install the scanning hardware -- it's hard to be enthusiastic about investing.\nNonetheless, if over the next few quarters Nano-X's scan revenue growth starts to accelerate sharply -- and there is a good chance it will based on its growing sales force and recent agreements with medical device makers -- shareholders who started a position will probably get wealthier.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nano-X Imaging right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nano-X Imaging, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nano-X Imaging wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is It Time to Roll With Nvidia and Invest in SoundHound AI?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) has disappointed a lot of investors since it went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in April 2022. The audio and speech recognition software company's stock opened at $8.72 and soared to its all-time high of $14.98 less than a month later. But earlier this month, shares were trading at less than $2.\nIts stock stumbled as revenue growth decelerated, losses stacked up, and rising interest rates compressed its valuation. Many investors dismissed it as another overvalued SPAC listing that quickly lost its luster as the hype died down.\nBut on Feb. 15, SoundHound's stock soared 67% after Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) disclosed a $3.7 million stake in the company. That's essentially pocket change for Nvidia, which ended its latest quarter with $5.5 billion in cash and equivalents, but is the chipmaker's investment a vote of confidence for the out-of-favor AI stock? Let's see why Nvidia might be interested in SoundHound -- and if investors should follow its example.\nThis isn't the first time Nvidia invested in SoundHound AI. Back in 2017, the chipmaker's GPU Ventures arm joined Samsung and 10 other investors in a $75 million funding round for the start-up.\nAt the time, Nvidia and its fellow investors likely considered SoundHound AI to be a potential competitor for Alphabet, Microsoft, and Apple in the voice recognition software market. SoundHound's namesake app identifies, discovers, and plays music, while its Houndify developer platform enables companies to create customized voice recognition tools without locking themselves into a single tech ecosystem.\nNvidia only holds about 0.7% of SoundHound's outstanding shares, but the investment is still a vote of confidence in the company's abilty to grow in the shadow of its larger competiitors. Nvidia also likely believes the nascent market will expand and evolve as new generative AI tools -- which are mostly powered by its own data center GPUs -- make voice-activated chatbots even more capable.\nNvidia's investment suggests SoundHound's service and technology hold promise, but investors should review its biggest issues before following Nvidia's lead. Over the past year, SoundHound's revenue growth has decelerated, its gross margins have declined, and its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) remained negative.\nMetric\nQ3 2022\nQ4 2022\nQ1 2023\nQ2 2023\nQ3 2023\nRevenue growth (YOY)\n178%\n84%\n56%\n42%\n19%\nGross margin\n77%\n71%\n71%\n79%\n73%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n(151%)\n(196%)\n(221%)\n(113%)\n(55%)\nData source: SoundHound AI. YOY = year over year.\nIt attributed that slowdown to the macro headwinds that drove many companies to rein in their software spending. However, management's fourth-quarter guidance calls for revenue to rise 68% to 111% year over year as its adjusted EBITDA finally turns positive. That outlook suggests SoundHound is out of its cyclical trough, and analysts believe its revenue rose 49% for the full year. That would put the company on track to deliver the 45% compound annual growth from 2023 to 2025 that analysts are expecting.\nSoundHound's stock isn't cheap at 15 times next year's sales, but it might justify that premium by expanding its high-growth niche of the voice recognition market, which Mordor Intelligence expects to expand at a CAGR of 23% from 2024 to 2029.\nYet investors shouldn't turn a blind eye to SoundHound's glaring weaknesses. It already laid off half of its workforce last year, but it still isn't expected to turn profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis anytime soon. It ended its latest quarter with just $110 million in cash, which isn't a lot of liquidity relative to its net loss of $73 million in the first nine months of 2023. And its high debt-to-equity ratio could limit its ability to raise fresh cash at reasonable rates.\nNvidia's decision to make such a small investment in SoundHound -- instead of taking a bigger stake or buying it outright -- suggests the AI giant has its own qualms about the business.\nIt might be a promising speculative play for long-term investors, but its high valuation, high leverage, and persistent losses could limit its near-term gains. In other words, investors can follow Nvidia's lead and nibble on the stock, but they shouldn't assume the chipmaker's investment will set a firm floor under its volatile price.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Oliver Rodzianko ",
        "Text": "Nvidia Corp.'s (NASDAQ:NVDA) valuation may look unappealing to some, but my peer analysis reveals only a moderate overvaluation at most. However, this needs to be monitored closely as the technology industry is prone to speculative prices. High growth is indicated by long-term artificial intelligence market expansion forecasts and, as such, I consider the stock worth holding long term.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nList of 52-Week Lows\nList of 3-Year Lows\nList of 5-Year Lows\nFounded in 1993, the company is a global leader in the design and manufacture of graphics processing units for the professional and gaming markets and system-on-a-chip (SoCs) units for the mobile computing and automotive markets.\nIt is best known for its GeForce GPUs, used for gaming, professional visualization and in data centers for high-performance computation. Nvidia's GPUs are also fundamental to the development and running of artificial intelligence models and it is accelerating machine and deep learning capabilities. It has also developed a platform called Drive, which is designed for autonomous vehicles, providing the computing power necessary for self-driving technology.\nIts Quadro GPUs are tailored for professionals needing design, visualization and simulation, aiding high precision and performance. Additionally, Nvidia's GeForce NOW platform and service is a cloud gaming infrastructure that allows users to stream games on various devices without requiring high-end hardware.\nAdditionally, Nvidia develops software. For example, CUDA harnesses the power of GPUs for higher computing performance.\nThe company acquired Mellanox Technologies in 2020, adding networking and interconnect technology to its portfolio.\nNvidia is a critical investment in long-term AI growth and major cutting-edge technologies. As such, understanding the broader market demands and growth outlook for its industry is crucial to assessing its valuation. My research proposes that Nvidia's growth may continue as the AI market expands and, as such, investors would be wise to hold the stock throughout present overvaluation concerns.\nBloomberg reported that the AI industry could grow at a compound annual rate of 42% over the next 10 years, with demand for generative AI products adding about $280 billion of new software revenue. The research estimates a $1.30 trillion AI market by 2032. Here is a breakdown of what AI segments could be worth in 2032, as outlined by Bloomberg Intelligence:\nAI infrastructure as a service - $247 billion\nDigital ads driven by AI - $192 billion\nAI servers - $132 billion\nSpecialized generative AI assistant software - $89 billion\nConversational AI devices - $108 billion\nAI storage - $93 billion\nComputer vision AI products - $61 billion\nConsidering the high CAGR anticipated for the AI market over the next decade, it is important to put Nvidia's historical growth in perspective to understand if the stock is rationally valued at this time.\nOver the past year, Nvidia has grown its earnings per share without non-recurring items at a rate of 173.20%, which is unprecedented historically considering its 10-year average of 34.30%.\nAlso consider free cash flow growth of 269.10% over the past year and 28.50% on average annually over the past 10 years:\nConsidering the broader trend in Nvidia's industry, arguably the fastest-growing market in the world, it may be possible for the company to maintain 20% or higher earnings per share growth over the next decade. Some reduction to past results is necessary to consider due to an already established business, even considering future market CAGR expectations. My earnings growth estimate is also roughly in line with the common consensus.\nMy future growth estimate leads me to my analysis of the stock valuation. I consider Nvidia's price the most significant risk when investing in it at this time. The stock has a price-earnings ratio of around 96, which comes down to around 36 based on future earnings estimates. Its forward price-earnings ratio is in the bottom 30% of companies in the semiconductors industry.\nNvidia is evidently overvalued by traditional discounted cash flow analysis, but this method is unlikely to fully account for the premium that is usually attributed to high-tech stocks. Looking for leading advanced technology companies trading below fair value is often impossible. As such, I believe a peer analysis is the better way to gauge technology company valuations.\nI think Nvidia can correctly be compared to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).\nAMD forward price-earnings ratio of 52\nTaiwan Semiconductor forward price-earnings ratio of 18\nBroadcom forward price-earnings ratio of 27\nAs such, Nvidia does not seem unreasonably valued based on the stock price of its peers. However, it is likely there is a moderate overvaluation to consider, as indicated by the GF Value Line.\nConsidering future earnings estimates for the next three years, including 44 analysts on consensus expecting 72.32% year-over-year growth reported in January 2025 and 30 analysts expecting on consensus 24.24% growth in January 2026, the future for Nvidia looks like it might have the most upside potential in the next few years. However, investors may want to consider how the market will react when earnings growth comes down to more reasonable levels. It could continue to price the company at a premium, or more likely, the valuation will drop to a more reasonable level, creating some short-term volatility before the stock price begins to grow more conservatively.\nIt is also important to understand Nvidia's forward price-earnings ratio of around 36 at this time is considerably lower than its median price-earnings ratio of 43.50 over the last 10 years. That could present a reasonable buying opportunity right now as long as investors are willing to tolerate some future volatility. The medium-term potential instability in the price of the stock seems worth it, considering the large long-term expected market growth of AI and Nvidia's crucial function in this area. If the market presents a moderate price drop in the stock soon, that is when I will be looking to take my first proper stake in the company.\nNvidia is very closely related to Taiwan Semiconductor and, as such, remains significantly exposed to geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. surrounding Taiwan at this time. While an invasion of the country seems unlikely to me based on my ongoing analysis of international relations, investors must be cautious not to allocate too heavily to technology at this time. If a larger war breaks out, I believe technology stocks will be the most significantly negatively impacted, although the broader economic effects will reach all industries.\nOverall, Nvidia still looks appealing to me. I would be cautious of allocating to the stock at this time too heavily, but even if bought at the present valuation, I believe long-term growth can still be expected over the next decade even if the stock experiences some volatility. My rating for the stock is a hold.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.\nThe chip giant has witnessed an impressive 228.8% rally in its stock price over the past year. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)\u00a0and\u00a0it is a growth stock as well as pricey too.\u00a0NVIDIA\u2019s P/E (ttm) ratio 76.13X versus the semiconductor industry\u2019s P/E ratio of 26.53X. NVIDIA\u2019s\u00a0expected growth rate for next year is 63.17%\u00a0versus the expected growth rate of 14% for the industry \u00a0and 4.96% for the S&P 500.\nDespite this remarkable run, Goldman Sachs remains bullish on the company's prospects and has raised its price target for Nvidia from $625 to $800, marking a potential upside of 21% from the previous Friday's closing price. This positive outlook has driven Nvidia's stock to new heights, with its market valuation now reaching $1.7 trillion, per a Business Insider article.\nGoldman Sachs analysts are confident that Nvidia's Data Center revenue will not fall in the second half of 2024, as previously anticipated. Instead, they expect a persistent uptick in Data Center revenue throughout the first half of 2025.\nThis positive outlook is attributed to several factors, including continued investments by major cloud service providers in generative AI infrastructure, a widening customer base, and the introduction of new product cycles.\nNvidia's reaffirmation of its conviction in growing Data Center revenue beyond CY2024, based on clear visibility into capital spending patterns among major cloud service providers.\nGoldman Sachs points to recent commentary from major cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet as evidence that Nvidia is poised to benefit from continued spending on AI-enabling GPU chips like the H100. These cloud giants have reported increased adoption and monetization of AI-related services and products, contributing to Nvidia's growth prospects.\nNvidia\u2019s competitor AMD's revised 2024 Data Center GPU revenue outlook indicates a substantial increase, further validating the market's potential. Marvell's positive comments about its optical DSP and custom compute businesses led Goldman Sachs to adjust its revenue forecasts for the Data Center segment, the IBD article indicated.\nForward guidance from Super Micro suggests an acceleration in revenue growth, reflecting increased demand for Nvidia's products. Positive commentary on AI-related capital spending by hyperscalers, with Meta Platforms increasing its 2024 capex guidance is another factor that can boost Nvidia\u2019s business. Goldman Sachs anticipates that Nvidia will ramp up production of its next-gen H200 hyperscaler in the second quarter of 2024.\nGoldman Sachs is not alone in its optimism, as Bank of America also raised its price target for Nvidia to $800 last week, underscoring the belief that the demand for AI technologies remains in its booming stage and will continue to drive Nvidia's growth.\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.22 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.23 a month ago based on 37 recommendations.\nOf the 39 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 33 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 84.62% and 7.69% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 83.78%, while Buy represented 8.11%.\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 37 analysts, the average price target for Nvidia comes to $664.12. The forecasts range from a low of $410.00 to a high of $1,100.00. The average price target represents an increase of 0.38% from the last closing price of $661.60.\nNVIDIA lacks on value. The stock has very high P/E and P/CF ratios. Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few NVIDIA-heavy ETFs so that investors can avoid company-specific concentration risks.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the most remarkable stocks since the hype around artificial intelligence (AI) took the market by storm. Since the beginning of last year, shares of the advanced semiconductor company are up nearly 400%.\nOne Wall Street analyst thinks there's still plenty of upside for Nvidia, too. Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital has initiated coverage with a buy rating and $1,200 price target. That's the highest of all analysts covering the stock, and it represents a 65% gain from where shares trade as of this writing.\nAnd remember Nvidia was trading below $120 per share as recently as Oct. 2022.\nThe explosion in spending on high-end AI chips that boost computing power hasn't just been a surprise to analysts and investors but to the company itself.\nIn May 2023, Nvidia beat its fiscal Q1 revenue guidance by about $700 million. But that was just the beginning: Over the next two quarters, actual revenue exceeded management's guidance by at least $2 billion each time.\nDemand for AI chips has Nvidia's data center business growing faster than the company itself can keep up with. All eyes will be on the fiscal 2024 year-end report due Feb. 21 to see if the company once again beats what's already a record $20 billion quarterly revenue outlook.\nLoop Capital thinks the company will continue to surprise investors as Nvidia sells all of the advanced chips it can make for several more years. The firm's $1,200 price target implies a trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 158.\nBut align Loop's forward-looking price target and Nvidia's earnings estimates, and that valuation drops quickly. Analysts expect the company to report $20.41 in earnings per share in fiscal 2025, giving the company a forward P/E ratio of 59. That's still a premium to the market, but it's a much more reasonable price tag for long-term investors who want a piece of this AI leader.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is Super Micro Computer a Better AI Stock than Nvidia?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Since the calendar flipped to 2024, there have been few stocks better than Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). The stock nearly tripled over two months, and its performance since the start of 2023 has also been impressive, rising around 900% in total.\nIn that time, few companies come close to matching the performance of Super Micro Computer (often called Supermicro), including artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouse Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). But does that make Supermicro a better AI stock than Nvidia?\nUsing the term \"better\" when comparing stocks is too broad to be analytically useful. It can mean comparing past performance, future prospects, or the underlying business. I'll look at all three factors to determine if Supermicro is better than Nvidia.\nEven though Nvidia is a strong performer, Supermicro's stock rise since 2023 blows Nvidia out of the water. So if we're talking about past performance, Supermicro takes the cake. Knowing this tidbit of information doesn't do you much good unless you have a time machine, though. Instead, I'll focus on the underlying business and potential future stock performance.\nSupermicro and Nvidia are closely tied. Both companies benefited from the rise of AI through their primary product lines. While Nvidia makes top-notch graphics processing units (GPUs) that are used to power AI workloads, Supermicro makes the servers that these GPUs go into to be efficiently used. While some of the larger tech firms have staff to help design the computing architecture, many do not. So smaller companies use Supermicro's highly customizable servers to meet their computing needs.\nThis makes me prefer Nvidia, as it controls the more desirable product. With Nvidia's GPUs in a class of their own in terms of AI computing power, customers have few choices to turn to if they want something different. Supermicro has competitors like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, so Nvidia's path to success is a little clearer.\nAdditionally, this allows Nvidia to have more control over its pricing, which plays out in its margin profile.\nWith Nvidia's gross profit and net income margin much higher than Supermicro's, it can absorb pricing changes without fully losing profitability.\nThis alone makes me prefer Nvidia to Supermicro. But what about future prospects?\nRegarding valuation, Nvidia is cheaper than Supermicro despite its better business position.\nOne area in which Supermicro will pass Nvidia is its revenue growth rate. Although Nvidia expects an impressive 234% growth rate in Q1 FY 2025, this will soon slow. After Q1, Nvidia starts to overlap quarters where GPU demand was incredibly high, so its growth rate will slow even though the company is still doing well.\nHowever, Supermicro's growth is just starting to reach these levels, as its growth projections for Q3 FY 2024 (ending March 31) are anywhere from 188% to 219%. But even though Supermicro's growth rate is starting to accelerate, it doesn't mean it's a cheap stock --\u00a0especially when we utilize its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which considers analyst growth projections.\nSo while Supermicro will continue to put up flashy numbers, I think Nvidia is the better buy here. With the stock being cheaper and having a stronger underlying business model, it's still the king of AI investments. That's not to say Supermicro is a bad company; it's that the stock has gotten too expensive for what it is.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "If This NVIDIA Rumor Is True, Intel Just Scored a Major Foundry Win",
        "Author": "  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM)\u00a0is the overwhelming leader in the foundry market, particularly when it comes to cutting-edge manufacturing processes. For companies like NVIDIA, TSMC's top-tier manufacturing capabilities have been effectively the only game in town for many years.\nIntel (NASDAQ: INTC) is looking to disrupt the foundry market by building a foundry business of its own. While Intel is still well behind TSMC technologically, the company's roadmap calls for a dramatic shift by the start of 2025. Over the next year, Intel is set to launch three new process nodes, with the final Intel 18A node expected to be the best in the industry, or at least on par with what TSMC has to offer.\nIntel has won a handful of customers for Intel 18A so far, but converting those commitments to meaningful revenue will take time. And of course, Intel still needs to prove to prospective customers that it can not only launch Intel 18A on time but also that the process can deliver the expected performance and efficiency characteristics.\nA quicker path to meaningful revenue for Intel's foundry business will come from advanced-packaging services. The process of packaging a semiconductor following manufacturing is critical, and as chips have become more advanced, packaging techniques have evolved. While traditional-packaging technology will remain widely used for the foreseeable future, advanced-packaging technologies enable 3D-chip stacking and other capabilities that have become increasingly necessary for the most advanced AI, smartphone, PC, and server chips.\nIntel disclosed in its fourth-quarter report that it had won a total of five advanced-packaging customers, with the majority of revenue generation set to kick in starting in 2025. A recent rumor suggests that Intel may have recently added another advanced-packaging win.\nUnited Daily News, a Chinese-language publication out of the Philippines, reported last week that NVIDIA had chosen Intel to provide advanced-packaging services for a portion of its AI chip production. TSMC has been struggling to keep up with demand for its own advanced-packaging services, so it would certainly make sense for NVIDIA to seek out other providers.\nIntel recently opened a brand new advanced-packaging facility in New Mexico, the result of a $3.5 billion investment. Intel's 3D-packaging technology is called Foveros, and it was first used in high-volume production for Intel's own Meteor Lake laptop CPUs that launched in December.\nFor Intel, selling advanced-packaging services for chips manufactured elsewhere has the benefit of acting as an on-ramp into its foundry ecosystem. By choosing Intel, an advanced-packaging customer can become comfortable with that company as a partner and eventually move some manufacturing over to Intel as well.\nIf this rumor is true, NVIDIA will only be using Intel for advanced packaging, not actual semiconductor production. However, if Intel succeeds in surpassing TSMC technologically in 2025, the company's manufacturing services will become far more appealing to NVIDIA and any other major chip designer. Winning NVIDIA as an advanced-packaging customer would also be a huge vote of confidence in Intel's fledgling foundry business.\nAs always, unconfirmed reports like this should be taken with a grain of salt. If Intel is indeed joining NVIDIA's supply chain, that would be incredibly good news for Intel's foundry initiative and shareholders holding on tight as Intel invests heavily to take on TSMC.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Intel wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "As Apollo\u2019s chief economist declares the Nvidia-inflated AI bubble \u2018bigger than the 1990s tech bubble,\u2019 here\u2019s what happened to the 10 priciest stocks from that era",
        "Author": "  Shawn Tully ",
        "Text": "Torsten Slok, partner and chief economist for the mega\u2013alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management, issued a brief on Sunday that in a single graphic, provided more useful information than any of the Wall Street analysts\u2019 writings predicting that the AI \u201crevolution\u201d would keep pushing stocks to fresh heights.\nSlok\u2019s report featured a bar chart showing the median P/E multiple for the 10 most valuable U.S. companies at five-year intervals from 1990 to 2020, and as of late February 2024, as well as displaying the overall numbers for the S&P 500, and the index excluding the top ten. His telling headline: \u201cThe current AI bubble is bigger than the 1990s tech bubble.\u201d\nThe source of that assessment? Slok\u2019s graph shows that the top 10 P/E multiple is now hovering at around 40, far above the readings in the 23 to 26 range between 1995 as the dotcom frenzy gathered momentum and the craze\u2019s near-apex in 2000. His conclusion: \u201cThe top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than during the tech bubble.\u201d\nSlok\u2019s analysis pointed me to examine the list of stocks that commanded those huge valuations in 2000, those still in the top 10 club over two decades later, and how the individual names, and the batch as a portfolio, have fared through today. I also decided to use a different metric from Slok\u2019s by replacing the median multiples with one based on the combined P/E for the whole group, in other words, their total market cap divided by all-in profits\u2014as if they were one giant enterprise. That way, I could determine how investors would have fared holding a cap-weighted assemblage for the entire big 10, and what that might tell us about the odds that today\u2019s buyers will greatly profit from holding Nvidia and the other trillion-plus tech glamour names, and hence going all in on the AI theme Wall Street\u2019s selling and that so far, Main Street and fund managers are buying in droves.\nMost market-followers could probably name the first half-dozen of the top 10 blindfolded, and likely in order. They\u2019re all tech titans and high-fliers: Microsoft ($3.04 trillion), Apple ($2.80 trillion), Nvidia ($1.98 trillion), Amazon ($1.82 trillion), Alphabet ($1.75 trillion), and Meta ($1.23 trillion). The remaining four are Berkshire Hathaway ($895 billion), Eli Lilly ($740 billion), Tesla ($635 billion), and Broadcom ($566 billion). All told, their market cap stands at $15.1 trillion, and over their past four fiscal quarters, they\u2019ve booked $468 billion in GAAP net profits. Hence, their combined P/E by our measure is 32.3. That\u2019s huge, though not as big as the 40 median cited by Slok. The reason for the difference is that the big multiples are concentrated among the top six at between 37 (Microsoft) and 141 (Lilly), while Meta, Alphabet, and Apple are all moderately lower and a single outlier occupies the deep \u201cvalue\u201d range, namely Berkshire.\nIn fact, the group reading of 32.3 is deceiving, because Berkshire, as the only old-economy stalwart on the list, sells at just 12 times its profits for the past four quarters. Excluding Warren Buffett\u2019s colossus, the others in the top 10 combined are sporting a far more formidable P/E of 36.\nThe question that Slok prompted: At valuations rivaling those in the tech bubble, should investors who consider buying some or all of these names proceed with extreme caution? Also concerning is that as these mostly superexpensive stocks get richer and richer, folks who favor index funds tracking or partially tracking the S&P 500 keep plowing more and more of their savings where they get the fewest dollars in profits per dollars invested, and shunning what\u2019s cheap and unloved.\nThe fate of the Top Ten from 2000 suggests that few of today's winners will prove hugely successful over the next quarter-century, and several are may crash from the heights.\nLeading the Billboard Top Ten in December of 2000 was \"Independent Women\" by Destiny's Child, followed by the likes of \"Kryptonite\" from Three Doors Down and the Pink classic \"Most Girls.\" On the market cap charts, the champ was General Electric at $472 billion. The other nine in order of valuation: Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, Cisco, Citigroup, Walmart, Microsoft, AIG, Merck, and Intel. Twenty-three years later, the only name still in the elite grouping is Microsoft. The class encompassed just three tech stars versus eight today (including Tesla), and was far more diversified, covering retailing, energy, financial services and everything from aircraft engines to appliances via GE.\nThe group's combined PE was 33.1, a hair above today's number of 32.3, but well below the mark of 36 excluding that wild card Berkshire.\nIndividually, the stars of 2000 performed poorly for the most part over the following two-decades plus. The worst were Great Financial Crisis victims AIG and Citi. Their stocks are down 94% and 80% from the close on the final trading day of 2000, measured by total shareholder return. In that span, GE delivered a TSR of 0, Cisco managed a positive 29%, Pfizer +42%, and Intel +152%. Merck (+240%) and Exxon Mobil (+385%) did much better, but still lagged the S&P 500's TSR from the start of 2001 through late February of 2024 of 500%.\nPut simply, eight of the 2000 top ten trailed the big cap benchmark, most by a big, big distance. By contrast, the gang boasted two gigantic winners. Microsoft stock jumped 29-fold, and Walmart multiplied its shareholders' stakes eleven times. In retrospect, the array acted something like a biotech company's portfolio of drugs in development, or a movie studio's roster of action thrillers. In other words, a mixture of mainly turkeys and a couple of blockbusters that hopefully will pay for all the clinkers and then some.\nHow much did the winners contribute to bail out the eight laggards? Overall, weighted by market cap, the ten from 2020 through February of 2024 gained just over 400% in TSR, thanks overwhelmingly to the powerhouse performances from Microsoft and Walmart. That's an annual return of 7%. The distressing part: The S&P's 500% increase equates to a yearly return of 8% that beat the 2000 vintage, Big Ten result by a substantial one percentage point annually, culminating in a 25% beat for the index over the full period.\nWhat can we learn from comparing the top ten from the tech bubble days to their 2024 counterparts? First, today's members are really, really expensive versus history, as Slok points out. Seven are selling at PEs of between 31 (Meta) and 141 (Lilly), and Apple at 28 times earnings that are at almost twice pre-COVID levels, and barely growing, also looks sumptuously valued. Only Berkshire appears, by traditional standards, to be selling at an attractive PE. Second, if you're tilting towards the eight tech superstars that dominate the class of 2024, you're making a highly concentrated wager on the future of AI. More than anything else, it's the buzz over how the world-altering new technology will raise the U.S. tech giants' profitability to a whole new level that's since the start of October, driven the PE for the contingent, sans Berkshire, from 29 to 36. These stocks are regarded much more as sharing a common narrative than the highly varied bunch in 2000. Which makes buying them in concert even riskier.\nIt's also important to consider how the Top Ten crew is increasingly the tail wagging the market. It's their soaring valuations that have lifted the S&P 500 multiple from 23.3 at close of last year's Q3 to almost 27 by late February. By the way, a 27 PE slightly exceeds the gauge of 26.4 at the end of 2000. Two years later, the index had slumped by 33%.\nAt these prices, if AI doesn't pan out, as must happen to justify these huge valuations, today's top ten could do even worse than the group from 2000. Will another Microsoft or two rescue the losers? The best candidate, we keep hearing, is Nvidia. And if you want \"scary,\" just run the numbers on what the AI phenom must do just to give a decent returns on its own, let alone prove savior for a basket of flops. Wall Street wants you to think that the fun for these marquee revelers is just beginning. Instead, the failure of AI to deliver as big or fast as Wall Street deems may prove the kryptonite that busts the blast. Three Doors Down on the turntable chanting their 2000 hit would furnish a fitting coda as the bash winds down.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n View our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt in January 2024, down from US$11.0b, one year before. However, it does have US$26.0b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$16.3b.\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, NVIDIA had liabilities of US$10.6b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$12.1b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$26.0b in cash and US$10.00b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has US$13.2b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nThis state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$1.95t company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\nBetter yet, NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 489% last year, which is an impressive improvement. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, NVIDIA generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 80% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that NVIDIA has net cash of US$16.3b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. The cherry on top was that in converted 80% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$27b. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with NVIDIA .\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

An estimated valuation for the company was not listed in the filing.\nMortgage rates continued to press higher, according to new data released on Thursday.\nYahoo Finance's Rebecca Chen reports:\nMortgage rates climbed further above 7% this week, complicating the housing market with mixed signals on where home affordability will head next.\nThe average rate for a 30-year fixed loan reached 7.16% on Thursday and has remained over the 7% threshold every day over the past seven days, according to Mortgage News Daily tracking. The latest average is the highest in two months, matching the highest level since late November.\nA separate index tracking the weekly average on a 30-year loan showed a similar story \u2014 the weekly average increased 12 basis points to 6.90% from 6.77% a week prior, according to Freddie Mac\u2019s latest release.\nSo far in 2024, housing market activity remains slow but is expected to accelerate when rates drop. However, resilient economic data \u2014 strong labor market and consumer spending \u2014 will likely delay the rate cut that many were expecting earlier in the year. That would have a dampening effect on the normally busy spring homebuying season.\n\"The economy is creating jobs, but this mortgage rate is really hitting affordability limits for many households,\" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors (NAR), said Thursday. \"Certainly, they cannot get a mortgage outside of their budget.

AMD (AMD), another AI chip play, rose nearly 10% while AI-driven stock Palantir popped nearly 3%. SuperMicro Computers (SMCI), which has been on a meteoric 200% rise this year, soared nearly 20% on Thursday alone.\nThe reach of Nvidia's success was seen beyond just the tech space.

A slew of other companies that aren't AI focused, including JPMorgan (JPM) and Waste Management (WM), also touched fresh highs during the session.\nAll of these moves higher come just a week after a hotter-than-expected inflation report spawned a mini-market sell-off and as Federal Reserve officials continue to indicate interest rate cuts are likely to come later than many hoped.

(We would constantly talk about Nvidia in the TheStreet\u2019s office, going back to 2018.)\n\u201coh and if you bet against Nvidia please don't forget to send me an invitation to your funeral....,\u201d Cramer posted.\nJim reminded me this morning via email that he named his dog Nvidia in 2017!\nI think this upbeat vibe is nicely captured in the actions by sell-side analysts on Nvidia this morning.\nThere were price target raises across the board as Nvidia\u2019s quarter and guidance pushed the stock closer to the $800 mark. Interesting to see DA Davidson at a $620 price target, which is about 20% below current levels. Conversely, Bernstein\u2019s new $1,000 price target estimates a 30% upside for Nvidia\u2019s stock from current levels.\nHat tip to @DeItaone on X for this helpful roundup:\nAt first glance, the story following Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) latest eye-popping earnings day is the financials themselves.\nTo see this kind of growth at Nvidia\u2019s scale is crazy:\nThe company\u2019s guidance was equally impressive.\nBut once the shock and awe wears off, I think you will see the Street dig in on Nvidia and really try to determine how this company is growing in 2025 and 2026. There has been some chatter on the Street this morning that Nvidia may start to see a sharp growth slowdown next year as Big Tech companies such as Microsoft rein in their AI spending after two heavy years of investment.\nTo that emerging debate, I offer up this key point from Stifel analyst Ruben Roy.\nRoy didn\u2019t shoot down the notion of Nvidia\u2019s growth miracle cooling next year but contended they won\u2019t fall off a cliff because of the work the company is doing to diversify its revenue base.\nSays Roy:\n\u201cAs questions regarding the sustainability of Nvidia\u2019s growth increase, we found management commentary on revenue diversification notable. In addition to continued growth of Networking and Software, Nvidia\u2019s overall Data Center revenue is increasingly diversifying across industries and regions, including a growing contribution from demand related to sovereign AI deployments. This diversification, in our view, is likely to continue as AI-related ROI for end users accelerates. \n\"Nvidia continues to believe that the migration from general purpose compute to accelerated compute represents a $1 trillion opportunity, longer term. As the AI Factory concept materializes, management believes that another $1 trillion opportunity could follow.\nBack to marveling at Nvidia\u2019s numbers\u2026 for now.\n"

        "Title": "3 ETFs with Big Nvidia Positions: SMH, IYW, SPMO",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is taking the market by storm, and it\u2019s not just the stock that is benefiting. Three ETFs with big positions in Nvidia, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:IYW), and the Invesco S&P Momentum ETF (NYSEARCA:SPMO) are reaping the rewards of Nvidia\u2019s historic run and look poised to capture more upside if shares continues to rise.\nTo find these ETFs featuring significant Nvidia exposure, I went to Nvidia\u2019s page on TipRanks and used the ETF Exposure tab on the side of the page, a useful tool that enables investors to sort through ETFs by a stock\u2019s percentage weight within the ETF.\nLet\u2019s take a more in-depth look at these three ETFs, which all have different strategies and different reasons for owning Nvidia. All have large positions in the surging stock, which is up 235.5% over the past year and closing in on a $2 trillion market cap. \nSMH is a $16 billion ETF from VanEck that, according to the fund, seeks to give investors \u201cexposure to the top 25 most liquid U.S.-listed semiconductor companies, spanning the entire industry value chain from chip design and fabrication to manufacturing machinery.\u201d\nSMH has a massive Nvidia position. In fact it makes up over one-quarter of this semiconductor-focused fund\u2019s assets, with a weighting of 25.7%.\nBelow, you\u2019ll find an overview of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\nIn addition to Nvidia, SMH owns Nvidia\u2019s competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and it also owns companies that are vital to the semiconductor manufacturing process like foundry Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and semiconductor equipment manufacturers Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML).\nSMH\u2019s top holdings are viewed favorably by TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score system, as eight out of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.\nThis ETF has crushed the market in recent years, thanks in no small part to its outsized position in Nvidia. As of January 31, SMH has returned an impressive 18.8% over the past three years, a phenomenal 32.1% over the past five years, and an incredible 26.1% over the past 10 years, easily beating the broader market S&P 500 (SPX) and tech-oriented Nasdaq (NDX) indices over each time frame.\nOf note, SMH has an expense ratio of 0.35%, meaning that an investor in the fund will pay $35 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually.\nI\u2019m bullish on SMH, given its large position in Nvidia, its track record of market-beating performance, and its portfolio of highly-rated stocks (according to Smart Score ratings). For investors looking to gain exposure to Nvidia in ETF form, SMH is a great way to do so due to its massive 25.7% Nvidia position and the fact that it gives you exposure to additional stocks that are swimming in the same lane as Nvidia.\nSell-side analysts view SMH favorably, giving it a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $223.22 implies 6.1% upside potential from current levels.\nMeanwhile, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF owns Nvidia as part of its strategy to \u201ctrack the investment results of an index composed of U.S. equities in the technology sector.\u201d IYW invests in U.S.-based electronics companies, computer hardware and software companies, and IT companies.\nNvidia makes up 6.8% of IYW\u2019s assets under management. This is a relatively large position, but it pales in comparison to SMH\u2019s massive 25.7% position.\u00a0Altogether, IYW owns 135 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 63.9% of the fund.\nBelow is an overview of IYW\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 Holdings tool.\nAs you can see, IYW has a broader focus than SMH, so while it has top-10 positions in semiconductor stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), it also owns stocks from beyond the semiconductor space like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\nLike SMH, IYW\u2019s portfolio is viewed favorably by TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score, and even more so, an impressive nine out of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above.\nWhile this ETF\u2019s focus is different than SMH\u2019s, one thing that the two funds have in common is that they\u2019ve both generated excellent returns over time. As of January 31, IYW has put up annualized returns of 14.2% over the past three years, 24.5% over the past five years, and 20.2% over the past 10 years.\nIYW has an expense ratio of 0.40%, meaning that investors in the fund will pay $40 in fees annually on a $10,000 investment.\nI\u2019m bullish on IYW overall, given its strong track record of performance and its highly-rated portfolio of top tech stocks, although it should be noted that SMH gives investors considerably more exposure to Nvidia.\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts assign IYW a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 106 Buys,\u00a027 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average IYW stock price target of $145.91 implies 10.2% upside potential from current levels.\nLastly, the Invesco S&P 500 ETF is another large Nvidia holder with an entirely different approach.\u00a0SPMO is \u201cbased on the S&P 500 Momentum Index,\u201d which \u201ctracks the performance of stocks in the S&P 500 Index that have a high \u2018momentum score.\u2019\u201d The fund and index are reconstituted and rebalanced twice a year, and components of the index are weighted by their market caps and their momentum scores.\nNvidia makes up 11.4% of SPMO\u2019s holdings, which is less than SMH\u2019s exposure but more than IYW\u2019s.\u00a0In total, SPMO owns 100 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 56.1% of the fund.\nBelow is an overview of SPMO\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\nSPMO isn\u2019t specifically focused on semiconductor or technology stocks like SMH or IYW, but some of these stocks, like Nvidia and Broadcom, appear in SPMO\u2019s top holdings, as these stocks have been leading the market higher. Beyond semiconductors, Meta Platforms is SPMO\u2019s largest holding, and the fund also owns plenty of names from outside of the tech sector that are performing well, like Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), General Electric (NYSE:GE), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).\nAn impressive nine out of SPMO\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 9 or higher.\u00a0Like SMH and IYW, SPMO has also generated good returns over time, although it doesn\u2019t have a track record as long as that of the other two funds, as it only launched in 2015. Still, as of January 31, SPMO had posted a solid three-year annualized return of 10.9% and an even better five-year annualized return of 15.1%.\nSPMO is reasonably priced, with an expense ratio of just 0.13%, making it the cheapest of the three funds profiled here. An investor in SPMO will pay just $13 annually in fees on a $10,000 investment. I\u2019m bullish on SPMO based on its decent performance, highly-rated portfolio, and substantial Nvidia position. \nAnalysts view the fund favorably, as SPMO earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 87 Buys, 12 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SPMO stock price target of $81.45 implies 6.3% upside potential from current levels.\nAll three of these ETFs are good options for investors, as they have strong portfolios and have generated solid returns over time. Any of the three is a worthy investment, but my pick of the three is SMH, as it offers by far the highest exposure to Nvidia, plus the best performance track record.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is likely to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on Feb 21.\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, the company expects revenues of $20 billion (+/-2%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $20.21 billion, indicating a whopping 234% increase from the year-ago reported figure.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is pegged at $4.54 per share. This suggests year-over-year growth of 415.9% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s earnings of 88 cents per share.\nThe company\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters while missing on one occasion, the average surprise being 19%.\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up before the announcement.\nNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\nThe continued strength of its Datacenter business on the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is expected to have boosted NVDA\u2019s fourth-quarter revenues. An increase in Hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have been tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.\nAdditionally, the Datacenter end-market business is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. The strong demand for its chips from large cloud service and consumer internet companies is anticipated to have aided the segment\u2019s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Our third-quarter revenue estimate for the Datacenter end market is pegged at $16.4 billion, indicating robust year-over-year growth of 354.2%.\nMoreover, NVIDIA\u2019s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market\u2019s last three quarters\u2019 results had shown signs of recovery as inventory with channel partners reached normal levels. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products.\nRevenues from the Gaming end market increased 81% year over year while growing 15% sequentially to $2.86 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Our fourth-quarter revenue estimate for the Gaming end market stands at $2.83 billion, implying a 54.7% increase from the year-ago quarter.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing 108% year over year and 10% sequentially in the third quarter. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter for the end market. Our fourth-quarter revenue estimate for the Professional Visualization end market is pegged at $433.3 million, suggesting a 91.7% increase from the year-ago quarter.\nFurther, the company\u2019s Automotive segment showed an improvement in trends in eight of the last ten quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter, mainly due to increasing investments in self-driving and AI cockpit solutions. Our fourth-quarter revenue estimate for the Automotive end market is pegged at $294.5 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 0.2%.\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for NVIDIA this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate ($4.71 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($4.54 per share), is +3.67%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\nZacks Rank: NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #2.\nPer our model, Synchronoss Technologies SNCR, AutoZone AZO and Booking Holdings BKNG also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\nSynchronoss sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +157.1%. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Mar 5. Its bottom-line result surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters while missing on two occasions, the average surprise being -16.8%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Synchronoss\u2019 fourth-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of 11 cents per share, significantly narrower than the year-ago quarter\u2019s loss of 72 cents. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $43.8 million, calling for a year-over-year decline of 29%.\nAutoZone is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 27. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +3.83% at present. AutoZone\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8.9%.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $26.18 per share, suggesting an increase of 6.3% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s earnings of $24.64. AutoZone\u2019s quarterly revenues are estimated to improve 4.4% to $3.85 billion.\nBooking Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.07%.

        "Text": "Nvidia, also known right now as \u201cthe most important stock on the planet,\u201d delivered record-breaking earnings on Feb. 21, with revenue rising to an eye-popping $22.1 billion, up 265%\u00a0from a year ago according to the earnings report, thanks to its artificial intelligence (AI) business.\nLearn More: 8 Best Cryptocurrencies To Invest In for 2024Find Out: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nThis is what some analysts, such as Wedbush Securities\u2019 Dan Ives, deemed it \u201cthe biggest moment for the market and tech sector in many\u00a0years,\u201d and a \u201cgame-changing moment for the tech bulls.\u201d\nTo put this into perspective, as of Feb. 13, shares of Nvidia were up 17,044% in the past 10 years, according to an Investor\u2019s Business Daily analysis.\nRead Next: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon\nIn turn, that means that if you had invested $10,000 in the stock 10 years ago, your investment would now be worth an eye-popping $1.7 million.\n\u201cThat\u2019s more than you\u2019ve made on any S&P 500 stock in that time. The S&P 500 itself is only up 176% in that time, only turning your $10,000 investment to $27,604. You\u2019d be more than $1.6 million richer by going with Nvidia over just the S&P 500,\u201d according to the analysis.\nHowever, some experts said that while data and statistics regarding what stocks have returned the most over elapsed periods are interesting, they are \u201cmaterially insignificant.\u201d\n\u201cHindsight is always 20-20,\u201d said Peter C. Earle, senior economist for the American Institute for Economic Research. He added that 10 years ago, there were undoubtedly as many reasons not to invest in Nvidia as there were reasons to put money into it.\nEarle argued that when Nvidia went public in 1999 it was a promising firm, but its headline business was supporting the graphics of video games becoming increasingly sophisticated.\nAnd from 2004 to 2014 there were plenty more reasons to invest in Amazon for instance, than in Nvidia, since over that period, Amazon\u2019s stock appreciated at an average rate of 21% per year while Nvidia\u2019s was averaging just over 10% per year, Earle added.\n\u201cOver the next five years Nvidia\u2019s stock rocketed ahead of Amazon\u2019s, even before AI became the focus of so much anticipated growth,\u201d continued Earle. \u201cMy point is only that explosive asset price appreciation of this sort is next to impossible to see in advance. Fortunately, even though most of us didn\u2019t own Nvidia stock (other than indirectly in our 401Ks), we will all benefit hugely from the innovation its products are making possible.\u201d\nYet, the stock\u2019s skyrocketing ascent doesn\u2019t seem like it will be stopping anytime soon \u2014 as shown in the company\u2019s financial forecast, which predicts revenue to be $24 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\u201cWe guide one quarter at a time. But fundamentally, the conditions are excellent for continued growth calendar \u201924, to calendar \u201925 and beyond,\u201d said Jensen Huang, Nvidia founder and CEO, according to a Feb. 21 earnings call transcript.\n\u201cAnd let me tell you why?

For instance, Angelo Zino, CFA and senior industry analyst for CFRA Research, said in a research note that the company lifted its 12-month target to $840 from $700, as it sees \u201ca slew of growth drivers that will support demand in CY 24/CY 25 and\u00a0beyond.\u201d\nAnd as Joe Camberato, CEO of National Business Capital, noted, the company\u2019s quarterly sales now make up a whopping 90% of last year\u2019s revenue.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not just impressive; it\u2019s a clear sign of the AI frenzy we\u2019re witnessing. We\u2019re on the brink of a tech revolution, and Nvidia\u2019s set to be a key player,\u201d he added.\nYet, some experts are against putting all your eggs in the same basket, warning \u201c[Ten thousand dollars] invested in any stock is like throwing darts at the board and saying you have the crystal ball in forecasting what to expect with any one company.\u201d\nInstead, try other options to take advantage of Nvidia\u2019s explosive growth such as investing via exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\u201cMost regular traders and investors are not that savvy nor do they have the patience or experience to be a top stock picker,\u201d explained Sean Kozak, CEO of Neurostreet. \u201cThis is where having a dual tech strategy comes in.\u00a0Using tech ETFs would be a better replacement as it allows you to not only play the bull market but also the bear\u00a0market.\u201d\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Groceries Frugal People Buy in Winter\nI'm a Costco Superfan: These Are the 5 Highest-Quality Kirkland Food Items\n7 Things the Wealthy Elite Do With Their Money (That You Should Be Doing, Too)\nStay Away From Banks That Are Still Doing This in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: $10K Invested in Nvidia 10 Years Ago Would Have Made You This Eye-Popping Amount of Money\n"

        "Title": "3 Healthcare Stocks That Have Outperformed Nvidia Since 2022",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech giant Nvidia has been one of the hottest stocks over the past couple of years, with its shares more than doubling since 2022. But technology isn't the only place where investors can find excellent investments. \nIn fact, three healthcare stocks that have outperformed Nvidia since 2022 are TransMedics Group (NASDAQ: TMDX), Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), and Verona Pharma (NASDAQ: VRNA). Here's a look at how well these stocks have performed, why they have fared so well, and whether they're still good buys today.\nTransMedics is a fairly small medical device company with a market capitalization of $2.5 billion. The company has developed an organ care platform for which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval; it can transport multiple organs. It's the only multi-organ platform that regulators have approved. It can improve patient outcomes and be a game changer for the business.\nThe business has been making significant progress in growing its top line over the years, and TransMedics continues to generate impressive numbers. On Monday, the company reported its 2023 fourth-quarter results, and revenue totaling $81.2 million was up 159% year over year. TransMedics also posted a profit of $4 million. For 2024, TransMedics expects its full-year revenue to grow by around 50%, totaling between $360 million and $370 million.\nWith a lot more growth still on the horizon, it may not be too late to invest in the healthcare stock despite its already impressive gains.\nEli Lilly has become the largest healthcare stock in the world after nearly tripling in value since 2022. The big reason for its recent success is tirzepatide, the active ingredient in both Mounjaro, its diabetes drug, and Zepbound, its approved treatment for weight loss. In clinical trials, tirzepatide has helped people lose an astonishing 26.6% of their body weight when patients made significant lifestyle changes while also using the drug.\nThe hype surrounding anti-obesity treatments has been the catalyst behind its rally over the past couple of years, as Eli Lilly truly has a game changer on its hands. Analysts believe that tirzepatide could generate at least $68 billion in annual revenue at its peak. Just how high that number ends up will depend on what other indications it may get approved for. In clinical trials, tirzepatide has helped treat fatty liver disease, and similar drugs have been associated with helping to reduce the cardiovascular risk for obese people.\nThere could still be a lot more upside for Eli Lilly's stock simply due to the opportunity for tirzepatide. Although the stock looks expensive, trading at well over 100 times earnings, that doesn't mean it has peaked; Eli Lilly may very well be the first healthcare stock to reach a $1 trillion valuation.\nPharmaceutical company Verona Pharma rounds out this list with gains of 156% since 2022. It's the riskiest stock on this list as it doesn't have an approved product just yet, but it's close to the finish line with ensifentrine. The FDA is currently reviewing the company's application for it in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a PDUFA date has been set for June 26.\nThe $1.4 billion stock could have a lot more room to run if regulators give the drug the green light as it could be a blockbuster, with analysts projecting that at its peak, it could bring in $1.5 billion in annual revenue.\nWithout approval, however, Verona will continue to incur losses and burn through cash as it doesn't have an approved product to rely on for consistent revenue. But with ensifentrine showing encouraging results in clinical trials, there's hope that approval will happen this year.\nIf you're not OK with taking on some considerable risk, however, you may want to wait on the sidelines with Verona Pharma stock as it's by no means a sure thing; if regulators push back on the treatment and don't end up approving it, that could lead to a sharp sell-off.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Medha Singh\n(Reuters) -Shares of smaller AI firms rallied on Thursday after the world's most dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker, Nvidia, disclosed stake in them, offering clues on its growth strategy.\nThe rally showed Nvidia's growing influence in the AI world as its market value grows at a scorching pace, making it the third most-valuable U.S. company.\nIts largest investment of $147.3 million was in Arm Holdings, the chip designer that Nvidia failed to buy after the $80 billion deal hit the antitrust hurdle two years ago.\nNvidia had last year indicated interest in purchasing shares of Arm during the British company's Nasdaq debut. Shares of Arm, which have surged more than 60% over the last week after a strong forecast, dipped nearly 0.5% on Thursday.\nNvidia disclosed its stakes as of Dec. 31 in a 13F filing late on Wednesday. The regulatory disclosure is closely watched by investors and is generally associated with moves made by fund managers rather than public companies.\nInsider Intelligence analyst Gadjo Sevilla said Nvidia's involvement in a broad range of companies could help it make more affordable but hyper-focused chipsets rather than expensive general-purpose AI chips.\nShares of biotech firm Recursion Pharmaceuticals, in which Nvidia invested nearly $76 million, gained 5%. Last year, Nvidia had said it would invest in it to speed up training of the Utah-based firm's AI models for drug discovery.\nThe Silicon Valley megacap firm also invested nearly $3.7 million in conversational voice assistants developer SoundHound AI, sending its shares 50% higher to $3.33.\nNvidia also bought stake in Israel-based medical device company Nano-X Imaging, which uses AI software to analyze reports. Nano-X shares rose 52% higher.\nAutonomous driving technology TuSimple Holdings, which delisted from the Nasdaq last week, drew $3 million in capital from the chipmaker.\n\"An Nvidia investment is taken as a strong positive by investors and should aid those companies that need to raise capital,\" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office.\nHe said its investments indicate a portfolio approach where one could expect both winners and losers.\nSoundHound shares were the most actively traded across U.S. exchanges, with 160 million shares changing hands by 11:30 a.m. ET, according to LSEG data.\nRetail traders too jumped into the race. SoundHound and Nano-X Imaging were among the top five most actively traded stocks by individual investors, J.P.Morgan data showed.\nShares of other micro-cap AI firms rose in tandem, with Guardforce AI adding 11% and BigBear.ai Holdings gaining 10.3%.\nSeveral well-known funds, including Rokos Capital Management and Bridgewater Associates, have also invested in the chipmaker toward the end of 2023, Nvidia's regulatory filing showed.\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru, Additional reporting by Bhanvi Satija and Johann Cherian; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n"

        "Title": "Better AI Buy: Nvidia vs. Super Micro Computer Stock",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman and Parkev Tatevosian, CFA, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) have been two of the top stocks to own during the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Since the start of 2023, shares of Supermicro (as it is commonly known) have vaulted 709% while Nvidia stock has jumped 374%. Up until a recent surge by Supermicro, the two stocks have followed a similar path.\nBoth Nvidia and Super Micro Computer have been great stocks to own so far, but it's worth asking which is the better one to own today. To answer that question, we asked two of our contributors to pitch their pick of the two. First, we hear the Nvidia case.\nParkev Tatevosian (Nvidia): Arguably, no company benefits as much from the rising effectiveness of artificial intelligence as Nvidia. Revenue and profits are soaring for the maker of graphic processing units (GPUs). Unsurprisingly, the stock price has followed suit, but even though the market price has increased, Nvidia's valuation is still attractive for investors looking to capitalize on the AI wave.\nIndeed, Nvidia's revenue jumped by 102% and 206% in its two most recent quarters from the respective quarters of the prior year. That can be primarily attributed to increased demand from enterprises and institutions looking to implement AI technology in their processes.\nMore importantly, the increase in sales has fueled a similar increase in profit for Nvidia. Operating income exploded to $6.8 billion and $10.4 billion in the two most recent quarters. Of course, a profit surge of this magnitude will attract competitors, but Nvidia is arguably at least one, perhaps two, steps ahead of its rivals.\nTo make the investment case more compelling, Nvidia is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 27, a relatively low price for a business with such excellent prospects. Investors can do worse than adding Nvidia stocks to their buying list.\nJeremy Bowman (Super Micro Computer): In many ways, Super Micro Computer is shaping up to be the next Nvidia. The company makes advanced servers and storage equipment that are well-suited to handle the kind of intense workloads that AI applications like ChatGPT demand. Supermicro works closely with Nvidia, and its hardware is built using Nvidia chips.\nThe relationship between the two stocks was reinforced again on Monday, when both stocks rose as Goldman Sachs raised its price target on Nvidia. While there wasn't a comment on Supermicro specifically, the analyst did note signs that AI server demand was strong and GPU supply was improving, which is good news for Supermicro.\nNvidia stock rose 5% on the news, but Supermicro jumped 14%. Those comments also indicate that Supermicro's business could be starting to experience the kind of breakout Nvidia saw last year. Improving GPU supply could also mean that Supermicro will beat its guidance for the year, as that was based in part on supply chain constraints.\nFinally, Supermicro also has the advantage of being significantly smaller than Nvidia, meaning it's easier for the stock to be a multi-bagger from here. Nvidia currently trades at a market cap of $1.7 trillion, compared with $37 billion for Supermicro. It's not unreasonable for a $37 billion stock to double, but for Nvidia to double would mean it would become the most valuable company in the world. That's not an impossible task, but it's not as easy as going from $37 billion to $74 billion in size.\nBoth stocks look like great choices in the AI revolution, but Super Micro Computer has more long-term upside potential than Nvidia and looks like a good bet to surge later in the year as GPU supply loosens up and it can fulfill more demand.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Today, semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a tremendous company worth over $1.7 trillion. Those who bought and held shares many years back are very wealthy today.\nBut thinking that you've missed the boat because you were late can be a costly mistake. You could have invested $10,000 in Nvidia just five years ago and still be sitting on $195,000 in gains today.\nNobody knew five years ago that artificial intelligence (AI) would impact Nvidia as it has, but that's the thing with great companies -- fortune tends to find them.\u00a0The cycle repeats. There are investors right now thinking they've missed out on Nvidia. But as you'll see below, that's not necessarily true.\nHere is why.\nIt's becoming increasingly clear that Nvidia is dominating the AI chip market. It's become widely known how the company jumped out to a quick lead, illustrated by exploding growth that began several quarters ago. Industry analysts estimate that Nvidia's early market share is between 80% and 95%. The technology sector's most prominent companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, and Meta Platforms, flocked to the company's flagship H100 and H200 series AI chips.\nNaturally, these companies, which are buying tens and hundreds of thousands of chips, may try to develop their own chips to save money and optimize their hardware for their own use. It looks like Nvidia is staying proactive here, which should be music to investors' ears.\nAccording to a report by Reuters, Nvidia will establish a new business unit for custom AI chips. As companies look for alternatives to Nvidia's standardized AI chips, it potentially opens the door for competitors that can help create these custom chip designs. Nvidia's custom chip unit will try to prevent market share leakage by working with customers looking for alternatives to Nvidia's standardized chip products. Custom chips are predicted to be a $30 billion niche in the AI chip space.\nThings can move fast in the stock market. Nvidia, which trades at over $720 per share, was only $200 a year ago. As you saw in the graph above, the company's growth spurt justified Nvidia's meteoric rise. However, investors must carefully weigh Nvidia stock's future potential versus its price tag.\nAs the calendar turns over, Nvidia's stock is pricing in the next fiscal year's earnings. Shares trade roughly 35 times its estimated earnings for the year ending January 2025. Remarkably, analysts' long-term growth estimates signal the stock is still arguably cheap on a forward-looking basis. That's a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio under 1.\nOn the other hand, analysts have set a very high bar, and coming up short could cause a painful contraction in the stock price. In other words, the stock is a riskier investment today than a year ago because expectations are higher.\nTime is a superpower for individual investors who don't need to meet quarterly performance quotas for their clients like hedge fund managers do. Naturally, a stock that has risen as much as Nvidia could easily see a pullback. But given the overwhelming evidence of Nvidia's AI dominance, now and moving forward, it may be unwise to avoid the stock altogether, holding out for a price that may never come.\nThat's why investors should dollar-cost average into Nvidia stock. Buying a little at a time will help investors build a position at various price points, automatically averaging down if the stock does take a fall. Plus, holding Nvidia with a multiyear time frame in mind will increase the odds that investors realize the company's long-term growth as investment returns.\nIt's much easier to imagine Nvidia being a much bigger company 10 years from now than to guess Nvidia's quarterly results and the market's reaction to them. Playing the long game will help investors get more out of the stock, especially as Nvidia's new-found growth opens up potential share repurchases and dividend growth over the coming years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Over the past 30 years, Wall Street has had no shortage of next-big-thing trends that have captivated investors. At the moment, nothing is garnering the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like artificial intelligence (AI).\nAI, which involves the use of software and systems to oversee tasks normally overseen by humans, has application across almost every sector and industry. This is likely why the analysts at PwC believe AI has the potential to add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030.\nOver the past year, megacap Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has led the charge among artificial intelligence stocks. It's become the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are the brains of high-compute data centers that allow for split-second decision-making by AI software and systems.\nSince 2023 began, shares of Nvidia have nearly quintupled in value, with the company closing in on $1.5 trillion in added market cap, all thanks to AI. With enterprise demand particularly high for the company's AI-accelerated chips and supply still short, Nvidia has enjoyed exceptionally strong pricing power, which has driven most of its sales increase.\nBut with Nvidia shares closing at $726 last week, the prospect of a stock split may begin to look all the more enticing.\nA \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter both its share price and outstanding share count without having any impact on its market cap or operating performance. Think of it as a purely cosmetic change that can either make a company's shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors, as with a forward-stock split, or can increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major exchange, as with a reverse-stock split. Nvidia would be looking at its second forward split in the past three years.\nHowever, Nvidia isn't the only high-flying AI or AI-related stock that appears primed for a potential stock split. What follows are three AI companies that could beat this GPU juggernaut to the punch and become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks.\nThe first artificial intelligence stock that could beat Nvidia to the punch and become Wall Street's next stock-split stock is none other than social media juggernaut Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Meta has never conducted a stock split, but its share price climbed to near $490 this past week.\nMeta is using AI in a variety of ways across its various products. In addition to helping with search and weeding out noncompliant posts made on its social media platforms, it's leaning heavily on generative AI to help businesses tailor their ads to users.\nMany of the investments Meta is making in AI and virtual/augmented reality probably won't result in a sizable increase in sales for years. In the meantime, it continues to generate almost 98% of its revenue from advertising. The company's social media real estate, which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads, is tops in the world, with nearly 4 billion collective monthly active users in the December-ended quarter. Meta should have no trouble commanding exceptional ad-pricing power more often than not.\nSomething else to note about Meta Platforms is that it's a cash-flow machine. It generated more than $71 billion in net cash from operations last year, and it closed out 2023 with over $61 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This treasure chest is what allows CEO Mark Zuckerberg the luxury of taking risks, which includes the development of Meta's own AI chips.\nA second AI-fueled company that can become Wall Street's next stock-split stock well ahead of Nvidia is server and storage-solutions specialist Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). Like Meta Platforms, Super Micro has never conducted a stock split. However, with its stock briefly surpassing $1,000 per share last week, a forward split is probably in consideration.\nSuper Micro Computer's more-than-doubling in sales this year is a function of its highly customizable and energy-efficient rack-scale servers being in high demand. It's also a reflection of the company relying on Nvidia's AI-powered GPUs in its products. Businesses wanting to harness AI to expand their long-term growth potential and reach are increasingly turning to Super Micro.\nWhat remains to be seen is if Super Micro Computer can hold onto its nearly exponential returns over the past couple of weeks. Shares ended the previous week up 183% on a year-to-date basis, and are up 878% since the start of 2023. Historically, every next-big-thing investment over the past 30 years has endured an initial bubble. This is to say that investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the uptake of new technologies or innovations. AI will likely share this fate.\nThe other challenge for Super Micro is going to be whether or not it can maximize demand for its rack-scale solutions in AI-accelerated data centers. Since Super Micro relies on Nvidia's GPUs, it's at the mercy of its suppliers. But if Super Micro can somehow meet or surpass Wall Street's already lofty growth expectations, a stock split could well be in the cards.\nThe third artificial intelligence stock that could leapfrog Nvidia and become one of Wall Street's next stock-split stocks is semiconductor giant Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). Before Avago acquired Broadcom in 2016 and kept its name, Broadcom had completed three splits. But Avago had never split its stock. As of Feb. 16, a single share of Broadcom was setting shareholders back a whopping $1,245.\nBroadcom is approaching AI inclusion a couple of ways. It's added AI features to its Trident networking processors, and in April 2023 introduced its Jericho3-AI chip for AI networks. Jericho3 is integral for high-performance data centers in that it's designed to connect up to 32,000 GPUs. In short, it's designed to handle increasingly faster workloads in enterprise data centers.\nOne factor that's definitely worked in Broadcom's favor is its juicy backlog. Although CEO Hock Tan failed to provide an update on Broadcom's backlog in fiscal 2023 (the company's fiscal year ends in late September), the company totaled a record backlog of $31 billion in mid-2022. Wall Street and investors love large backlogs, because it typically leads to highly predictable operating cash flow.\nBut something investors should keep in mind is that Broadcom is generating a significant percentage of its revenue from wireless chips and accessories used in smartphones. While this segment should continue to deliver modest growth and plenty of cash flow for Broadcom, it could, ultimately, hold back the company's overall growth rate given how large of a role it plays in net sales.\nWith one of the highest nominal-dollar share prices on Wall Street, Broadcom is a logical candidate to split its stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) played a major in the Nasdaq Composite's 43% return last year. Indeed, investor enthusiasm for AI has carried over into 2024 -- helping fuel the S&P 500 to record levels.\nWhile each member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is playing a role in AI development, several companies in this cohort also share a more specific interest in voice-recognition software. Let's break down the various moves megacap tech has made in speech-powered AI assistants, and assess one stock in particular that could be set for liftoff.\nWhether you realize it or not, you probably interact with voice-based assistants almost every day.\nApple acquired AI-assistant Siri back in 2010 and has since integrated the technology across its ecosystem of hardware devices. More recently, Cupertino bought the music recognition app Shazam for $400 million.\nBoth Alphabet and Amazon have also shown a keen interest in voice-recognition applications, as each company's smart home appliances leverage this technology. Moreover, Microsoft acquired conversational AI tool Nuance a couple of years ago for $20 billion -- the third-largest acquisition in the software giant's history.\nBut most recently, semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia revealed that it has built a small stake in voice-recognition software developer SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). Following the news of Nvidia's investment, SoundHound AI stock rocketed higher -- the stock gained 347% in the month of February.\nI find this deal with Nvidia particularly delightful because in early January, I predicted that SoundHound AI may be a stock to keep your eyes on in 2024. My thesis primarily hinged on two ideas: voice-based software tools could become increasingly popular as use cases for AI continue to evolve, since voice controls can make AI tools easier to use. Furthermore, the market's appetite for acquisitions could rise this year.\nSince SoundHound AI's trailing-12-month revenue is only $46 million, the company is still quite small. But with cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog of $661 million, it's clear that the demand for voice-powered AI is rising -- and it's not all coming from big tech.\nConsidering that industry research sees the market for voice-recognition technology reaching $50 billion by the end of the decade, it appears to be early innings for SoundHound AI. While the stock has some momentum pushing it higher right now, this little-known AI company could emerge as a big winner in the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "When Nvidia crossed the $2 trillion market cap threshold on Friday, tech bull Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities predicted the party was just starting for artificial intelligence stocks.\nBy the look of it, billionaire Marc Rowan is happy to be on the opposite side of that trade after his investment firm, Apollo Global Management, warned valuations have surpassed the excesses of the dotcom era.\n\u201cThe top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than the top 10 companies were during the tech bubble in the mid-1990s,\u201d wrote Torsten Sl\u00f8k, partner and chief economist at Rowan\u2019s wealth management firm, in a research note published on Sunday.\nThe Princeton-trained economist with over 25 years in the industry has adopted a cautious view of late, predicting this month that what appears to be a soft landing for the U.S. is in fact a \u201cfragile equilibrium.\u201d He estimates the chances are greater than 50% that the Federal Reserve will surprise markets by course-correcting: Either it will cut rates in panic or it may end up even having to hike them.\nWhereas Ives is a buy-side analyst making a living by marketing tech stocks to clients, Sl\u00f8k\u2019s employer is actually risking capital and can therefore ill afford succumbing to market hype.\nHis warning comes after Nvidia posted the\u00a0single biggest gain\u00a0in market cap in history, gaining\u00a0$277 billion\u00a0on Thursday alone, more than the overall value of a Coca-Cola or Bank of America. Perhaps just as worrying, it crushed a record that had been set by Meta\u00a0only earlier this month.\nNvidia\u2019s business is fueled by a wave of demand for its data center chips that power advanced generative AI such as Sora, the latest breakthrough from OpenAI that creates photorealistic videos up to 60 seconds long from a few text prompts.\nCustomers have flooded Nvidia with so many orders for AI inference training chips like the H100 Tensor Core GPU that CEO Jensen Huang must weigh how best to fairly distribute his company\u2019s chips. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella is now looking to get a cut of Nvidia\u2019s action with its own Maia chip, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk admitted he may not have even invested in his high-risk Dojo supercomputer project had he been able to get his hands on enough Nvidia chips.\nNvidia has even become a matter of national security, with the U.S. prohibiting the export of its high-performance chips to China. Thanks to the advent of Nvidia-powered AI systems, cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang has now suggested parents should stop encouraging their kids to learn how to code since that will be handled by machines in the future.\n\u201cIt is our job to create computing technologies that nobody has to program,\u201d he said at the World Governments Summit in Dubai two weeks ago, adding that the miracle of AI meant that \u201ceverybody in the world is now a programmer.\u201d\nOne asset manager who surprisingly seems to be taking the side of Apollo\u2019s Sl\u00f8k is none other than ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood. The disruptive tech evangelist and AI champion recently lowered her exposure to the AI semiconductor space, selling $4.5 million worth of shares in Nvidia. On Friday she also trimmed her holding in foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which produces the Nvidia chips, for the first time in over two years.\nWood told the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Take on the Week podcast recently that she expects Nvidia competitors will soon start to pressure margins at Huang\u2019s company.\n\u201cThe expectation levels just get so high that they cannot be met,\u201d she said.\nWhether she might otherwise harbor Sl\u00f8k\u2019s misgivings about the Magnificent Seven tech stocks behind the continued equity market rally, she did not reveal.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM) recent financials offer further proof that the smartphone and other consumer electronics markets are finally making a comeback after getting through a tough 2022 marred by excess inventory. That comeback comes just as the industrial chip market (which includes chips for electric vehicles (EVs)) is now entering a similar period of decline. After several years of chip shortages, there are now too many industrial chips in inventory in the global supply chain.\nThankfully, Qualcomm's small automotive segment is bucking the trend, completely passing up the pedestrian-looking results from leading automotive chip designers Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Mobileye (NASDAQ: MBLY) (which is still majority-owned by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)).\nIs it time to get excited about Qualcomm's auto chip business?\nFor starters, let's first acknowledge that some 80% of Qualcomm's revenue still comes from the smartphone market. Thus, the company will still be highly reliant on a stabilization in smartphone sales in 2024. So far, so stable. Based on overall guidance for the first few months of the calendar year, Qualcomm is expecting as much as a 5% rise in sales this year. Clearly, there's still more work to be done to get the consumer electronics market (which also includes the rallying PC and laptop space) back in tip-top shape.\nBut then there's Qualcomm's automotive segment, which blew away expectations with a 31% year-over-year revenue increase to $531 million in the last quarter (Q1 fiscal 2024, which ended Dec. 24, 2023).\nIt's an impressive showing for Qualcomm, especially considering its peers in advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) and other auto tech suppliers have been reporting.\nCompany\nQ3 2023*\nChange (YOY)\nQ4 2023*\nChange (YOY)\nQ1 2024 Outlook*\nImplied Change (YOY)\nQualcomm**\n$535 million\n15%\n$598 million\n31%\nDown slightly from Q4\n20%-plus\nMobileye**\n$530 million\n18%\n$637 million\n13%\n$229 million\n(Approx. 50%)\nNvidia**\n$261 million\n4%\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nData sources: Qualcomm, Mobileye, and Nvidia. *Data is for the calendar year quarter. **Nvidia's latest quarter ended Oct. 29, 2023, Qualcomm ended Dec. 24, 2023, and Mobileye's latest quarter ended Dec. 30, 2023. Nvidia's calendar Q4 and Q1 have not yet been reported.\nWhat is Qualcomm doing differently that's helping it out-drive its competitors? There's one key factor: Qualcomm isn't just an ADAS and self-driving car chip company. Qualcomm's automotive segment also includes digital cockpit and infotainment chips, vehicle mobile connectivity, and other solutions that an automaker can pick and choose from depending on their model and trim level.\nConversely, Mobileye is focused on just ADAS and self-driving car applications. Nvidia's automotive segment is similarly aligned, while its data center solutions for automakers like software and self-driving AI algorithm development are reported under its booming \"Data Center\" segment.\nQualcomm's auto revenue currently sits at just 6% of total revenue, but that figure is quickly rising. Back in late 2022, Qualcomm outlined plans to get auto chips up to at least $4 billion by fiscal year 2026 (mostly calendar year 2025), a nearly 70% increase from the annualized auto revenue run-rate just reported last quarter.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has soared over 435% since the beginning of 2023 as companies flock to the tech giant for its top-performing suite of artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Its top and bottom lines have exploded, rising at triple-digit rates quarter after quarter. In the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, revenue reached a record high $22.1 billion, and net income rose to $12.3 billion.\nBut even amid this good news, investors have worried about one thing: competition. Nvidia faces challenges from fellow chip designers like Advanced Micro Devices and even some of its partners like Amazon Web Services (AWS). But before you worry too much about rivals dethroning this market giant, it's important to look at one particular number -- one that may ensure Nvidia's AI chip dominance going forward.\nI'm talking about research and development (R&D) spending. As you can see below, Nvidia's R&D expenses have climbed over the years, reaching $8.7 billion in fiscal 2024. That's up nearly 500% in just seven years, indicating Nvidia has been focused on driving innovation over that period.\nToday, Nvidia controls more than 80% of the AI chip market, so the company has a clear advantage. But at the same time, rivals are doing what they can to chip away at Nvidia's lead.\nAMD released a new high-performance chip late last year, and though it's slower than Nvidia's top product, it may win over some cost-conscious customers. AWS is also aiming for customers on a budget with its offering of chips for training language models and inference. And these are just two examples.\nThis is why it's essential for Nvidia to pour resources into R&D to keep innovating so its chips will continue to lead the market. That gives the company pricing power, and it should ensure its AI chip dominance over the long term.\nAnd these efforts, along with an excellent earnings track record, make Nvidia a great growth stock to buy today.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Both of these companies have commanding leads over smaller players, and demand for their respective chips is off the charts.\nOver the past year, Nvidia stock has turned $1,000 into more than $3,000, and investors might be worrying that they have missed the boat. If they're looking for lesser-known names, they might find Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM). The company went public last year and has since flown under the radar, overshadowed by other opportunities in the semiconductor space.\nBut earlier this month, Arm blew away Wall Street's expectations during its earnings call for its fiscal third quarter, ended Dec. 31. After reporting earnings on Feb. 7, Arm's stock nearly doubled over the next three trading days.\nThe price jump is eye-popping, but is the stock a buy now?\nOne thing to make clear right off the bat is that the semiconductor industry is cyclical. Demand for chips is going to ebb and flow, and challenges from supply chains and even geopolitical concerns can bring added layers of complexity.\nAs a result, semiconductor companies can experience dramatic swings in revenue, margins, and profit. Arm has been no stranger to this dynamic, with inconsistent financial and operating performance over the last few years.\nBut the semiconductor industry is operating in high gear at the moment, and Arm is a beneficiary. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company reported revenue of $824 million -- an increase of 14% year over year. This handily eclipsed Wall Street's consensus estimate of $761 million.\nPerhaps even better, Arm had a strong performance on the bottom line as well. The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.29, narrowly beating the high end of its prior guidance. This\u00a0 outperformed analyst estimates of $0.25 per share.\nWhat might have sent the stock parabolic was management's guidance. For the current quarter, the company is expected to generate between $850 million and $900 million in sales. Yet again, Wall Street's consensus estimate was far below this range. Management's forecast was more than $100 million above analyst estimates.\nArm is benefiting from secular tailwinds fueling the overall semiconductor market. And while this dynamic is good for business right now, the stock is getting bought up.\nAs of the time of this writing, Arm's market cap has increased more than twofold since it reported earnings.\nWith trailing-12-month revenue of $2.9 billion, the company is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of about 40. That is in line with Nvidia's P/S -- and Nvidia is a much larger, faster-growing business with significantly more market share in AI chips.\nWhile Arm's management deserves credit for the company's impressive performance, the stock price and the company's valuation relative to underlying results (and benchmarked against peers) are disconnected.\nTo be clear, I do not view Arm as a poor investment choice. However, at its current valuation, it seems that there is a lot of momentum at play. My hunch is that short-term traders have bought the stock in the hope of booking a quick profit as AI stocks continue to soar. Participating in such a movement carries immense risk and could leave you holding the bag.\nIf you're interested in adding names in the semiconductor space to your portfolio, Arm could represent a decent option beyond mainstream opportunities. But there is a lot of potential downside in buying the stock right now at an inflated price.\nI think the most prudent thing to do would be to keep an eye on the company's performance and assess if management is executing. If the company continues to beat its own guidance and outperform analyst expectations, then a premium valuation could be warranted.\nBut for now, I see the stock as overvalued -- perhaps even entering meme territory. I think there are safer alternatives for gaining exposure to AI, and chips in particular. Arm could represent a solid option in the long run, but I'd stay away from the stock for now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Arm Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Could Super Micro Computer Become the Next Nvidia?",
        "Author": "  Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the darling of Wall Street for a while. Shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker are up an astounding 1,700% over the last five years.\nThis year, however, another stock has caught Wall Street's eye: Up an eye-popping 98% year to date, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has to be the hottest stock on Wall Street. \nBut the question for investors is this: Is the company just a flash in the pan, or is it a stock with real staying power?\nThe first thing to know about Super Micro Computer is that the company has been around for decades. Incorporated in 1993, the company's stock debuted via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2007.\nThe company makes and sells computer hardware, with a focus on server, storage, and security equipment. And while the company's sales grew significantly over its first decade and a half as a public company, a new factor has kicked its revenue into high gear over the last 12 months: AI.\nIn short, AI-powered tools require a lot of computing power -- and I mean a lot. Companies like Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Tesla are buying AI chips like hotcakes. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example, announced in January that Meta was planning to purchase 350,000 H100 chips from Nvidia. \nBear in mind, each one of those chips costs as much as a new car, $30,000 or more, and companies like Meta want to put them to use as quickly as possible, as they race to develop the next big breakthrough in AI. That means they want off-the-shelf server racks that will get their new chips up and running quickly, safely, and efficiently. \nAnd wouldn't you know it: Supermicro makes the server racks and infrastructure that makes that possible. Moreover, its proprietary cooling technology is often sought out by the hyperscalers who run data centers due to its ability to boost AI chip performance.\nSupermicro founder and CEO Charles Liang summed up the market landscape on a recent earnings call: \nSupermicro is at the forefront of the AI revolution, where the pace of innovation is accelerating. We are leading the race by developing the most innovative AI infrastructure on many platforms at rack scale, for almost any industry, and for any market vertical. ... We are in overdrive to accelerate ... [our] business model with this AI boom. [In] the meantime, we are preparing ourselves for the next phase of ... [our] business growth. ... Now is certainly the most exciting time yet for Supermicro.\nTo put it another way, Super Micro is riding the tidal wave of demand for AI chips by supplying the hyperscalers with the brick-and-mortar infrastructure that keeps their expensive AI chips running efficiently -- and it's making a ton of money in the process.\nAs of its most recent quarter (the three months ending on Dec. 31, 2023), the company's revenue skyrocketed by 103% to $9.2 billion on a trailing-12-month basis. Moreover, the company raised guidance for the full fiscal year (the 12 months ending on June 30, 2024) to $14.5 billion, up from a prior estimate of $10.5 billion.\nIn some ways, Supermicro has already exceeded Nvidia. For example, the company's shares are up 3,630% over the last five years, while Nvidia's are up \"only\" 1,700%. \nSMCI data by YCharts\nYet, in a larger sense, Supermicro has a long way to go to catch Nvidia. The company's market cap is $30 billion; Nvidia's market cap is well over $1 trillion. \nIn that respect, it's unlikely that Supermicro will ever catch up to Nvidia. However, for growth-oriented investors looking for a hypergrowth stock that is highly leveraged to the AI revolution -- look no further than Super Micro Computer.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Super Micro Computer wasn't one of them.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Shareholders in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) may be thrilled to learn that the analysts have just delivered a major upgrade to their near-term forecasts. The consensus statutory numbers for both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) increased, with their view clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects.\nFollowing the upgrade, the current consensus from NVIDIA's 53 analysts is for revenues of US$105b in 2025 which - if met - would reflect a huge 133% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to soar 190% to US$22.21. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$94b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$18.32 in 2025. So we can see there's been a pretty clear increase in analyst sentiment in recent times, with both revenues and earnings per share receiving a decent lift in the latest estimates.\n Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nIt will come as no surprise to learn that the analysts have increased their price target for NVIDIA 14% to US$802 on the back of these upgrades.\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that NVIDIA's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 133% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2025 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 28% p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 17% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that NVIDIA is expected to grow much faster than its industry.\nThe biggest takeaway for us from these new estimates is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, with improved earnings power expected for this year. Fortunately, analysts also upgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates sales are expected to perform better than the wider market. Given that the consensus looks almost universally bullish, with a substantial increase to forecasts and a higher price target, NVIDIA could be worth investigating further.\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple NVIDIA analysts - going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here.\nAnother way to search for interesting companies that could be  reaching an inflection point is to track whether management are buying or selling, with our free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 46% over the last three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study NVIDIA's  ROE in this article.\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:\n57% = US$19b \u00f7 US$33b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.57.\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nTo begin with, NVIDIA has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 14% which is quite remarkable. So, the substantial 28% net income growth seen by NVIDIA over the past five years isn't overly surprising.\nWe then performed a comparison between NVIDIA's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 27% in the same 5-year period.\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is NVIDIA fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\nNVIDIA has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 5.4%, meaning that it has the remaining 95% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like NVIDIA is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.\nMoreover, NVIDIA is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 0.6% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in NVIDIA's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 78%, over the same period.\nOn the whole, we feel that NVIDIA's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Technology stocks are having a great few months as investors regain confidence in this sector thanks to new catalysts such as artificial intelligence (AI). This goes part way to explaining why the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index is up a solid 45% in the past year.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) played a central role in driving the impressive surge in tech stocks. Shares of the graphics card specialist have tripled over the past year thanks to AI. The company will release its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results later this month, and analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to increase a solid 119% year over year to $59 billion. What's more, Nvidia's earnings are set to jump from $3.34 per share in fiscal 2023 to $12.30 per share in fiscal 2024 as per consensus estimates.\nEven better, Nvidia could sustain its healthy stock market momentum as analysts have been raising their growth estimates thanks to the company's dominant position in AI chips. That could lead to eye-popping multiyear growth for the company.\nHowever, Nvidia's expensive price-to-sales multiple of 37 and price-to-earnings multiple of 87 may lead value investors to look for better bets in the technology space (even if Nvidia is able to justify its expensive valuation by delivering stellar growth). The good news is that there are a couple of other tech stocks significantly cheaper than Nvidia that investors should consider buying right away before they fly higher.\nShare prices of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) shot up 155% in the past year, and the company's latest earnings report suggests that the rally is here to stay. Meta stock jumped 20% on the day after the company released its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb. 1.\nThe social media giant reported a nice year-over-year jump of 25% in revenue to $40.1 billion, while earnings increased a whopping 103% to $5.33 per share. The numbers were well ahead of Wall Street's expectations, as analysts would have settled for $4.82 per share in earnings on $39.1 billion in revenue. More importantly, Meta's revenue guidance of $34.5 billion to $37 billion for the current quarter turned out to be better than consensus expectations of $33.9 billion.\nThe midpoint of the guidance range points toward a year-over-year increase of 25%. However, there was another factor that led to a sharp spike in Meta stock following its earnings release -- the company's announcement that it is initiating a quarterly dividend. Meta will pay a cash dividend of $0.50 per share next month, and it intends to pay a quarterly dividend going forward.\nGiven that the digital ad market that Meta serves is set to grow 13.2% in 2024, up from last year's 10.7% growth, it won't be surprising to see the company sustain its impressive growth momentum through 2024. Additionally, digital ad spending is predicted to increase by 11% in 2025, followed by almost 10% growth in 2026. All this indicates why analysts recently raised their growth expectations for Meta.\nMeta stock is trading at 9 times sales right now, which is almost in line with its five-year average sales multiple and is a significantly cheaper multiple than Nvidia. Assuming it can maintain such a multiple next year and hits $197 billion in revenue, as the chart above indicates, its market cap could increase to $1.77 trillion over the next three years. That would be a nice jump of 46% from its current market cap.\nHowever, if the market rewards Meta with a higher sales multiple thanks to its accelerating growth, it could deliver more upside. That's why investors looking to buy a top tech stock right now should consider buying Meta before it jumps higher.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is another tech stock that got a nice boost following the release of its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb. 1. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud computing giant jumped 8% as the company's revenue increased 14% year over year to $170 billion, beating the $166.2 billion consensus estimate.\nAmazon's earnings, on the other hand, jumped from just $0.03 per share in the year-ago period to $1 per share last quarter, handsomely exceeding the $0.80 per share Wall Street estimate. The company's robust year-over-year growth was driven by improvements across all of its business segments, while a slower increase in its expenses led to a strong bottom-line jump.\nWhat's more, Amazon is expecting to deliver double-digit growth once again in the current quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range. It forecasts revenue to land between $138 billion and $143.5 billion in the current quarter, an increase of 8% to 13% over the prior-year period. The company's operating income guidance of $8 billion to $12 billion points toward a big jump from the year-ago period's figure of $4.8 billion, and it is ahead of the $9.1 billion Wall Street estimate at the midpoint.\nHowever, don't be surprised to see Amazon clocking faster growth as it has been tapping AI to make its mark in fast-growing markets.\nFirst, the company is integrating generative AI tools into its e-commerce platform. It has rolled out an AI-powered shopping assistant, christened Rufus, which Amazon says has been \"trained on Amazon's product catalog and information from across the web to answer customer questions on shopping needs, products, and comparisons, make recommendations based on this context, and facilitate product discovery.\"\nThe company believes that Rufus will make it easier for customers to find and purchase products on its platform. Such tools can help Amazon capture a greater share of the e-commerce market, which is expected to clock 9.4% growth in 2024 and generate $6.33 trillion in revenue. By 2027, the global e-commerce market is anticipated to clock annual sales of over $8 trillion. So, Amazon's focus on giving tools to customers that could help elevate their shopping experience could act as a catalyst for its long-term growth.\nOn the other hand, Amazon is in a nice position to capitalize on the fast-growing market for AI in the cloud. The company has been collaborating with Nvidia to bring the latest hardware and software to customers so that they can train AI models and build generative AI applications in a cost-effective manner. Amazon Web Services is the top provider of cloud infrastructure services in the world, with a market share of 32%.\nWith the market for AI in the cloud predicted to jump to $887 billion in 2032 from $43 billion in 2022, Amazon's focus on this market could eventually lead to huge gains in the long run. As such, it is not surprising to see why analysts are predicting the company's earnings to increase at an impressive annual rate of 87% for the next five years.\nThat's why investors would do well to buy Amazon stock while it is trading at a relatively cheaper 59 times trailing earnings when compared to Nvidia's multiple of 83, especially considering that the latter's earnings are forecast to grow at 102% a year for the next five years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jing Pan ",
        "Text": "It's no secret that CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer holds Nvidia (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang in high esteem. After all, the \u201cMad Money\u201d host once hailed Huang as \u201cthe da Vinci of tech.\u201d\nBut how does Huang compare to Elon Musk, the visionary entrepreneur celebrated for revolutionizing transportation on Earth with Tesla and in space with SpaceX?\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years \u2014 but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger\nInflation is still white-hot \u2014 use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says\nAnything can happen in 2024. Try these 5 easy money hacks to help you make and save thousands of dollars in the new year (they will only take seconds)\nIn a recent CNBC segment, Cramer faced the question of whether he sees Huang as \u201ca bigger visionary\u201d than Musk. His answer was unequivocally affirmative.\n\u201cYes, and I\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d Cramer explained. \u201cI think that Musk can see around the corner. But I think that Jensen is thinking about a legacy of changing the entire paradigm about the way the world is. Jensen is creating single handedly an industrial revolution.\u201d\nCramer's remarks followed Nvidia's announcement of exceptional quarterly results. The chip giant reported that its Q4 revenue surged by 265% year-over-year, while its earnings per share skyrocketed by 765%.\nNvidia shares shot up 16% after earnings. Over the last 12 months, the stock has seen a gain of over 236%.\nWhile shareholders are celebrating Nvidia's massive success, it might be worth noting that the company's innovative leaps are grounded in a philosophy that embraces \u201ca tolerance for failure.\u201d\nHuang earned his master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1992. In 2011, he returned to his alma mater to deliver a lecture on the challenges and rewards of building a company.\nCentral to his discourse was the concept of failure.\n\u201cIf you want to be successful, I would encourage you to grow a tolerance for failure,\u201d he stated.\nHowever, Huang clarified that he's not advocating for failure per se.\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\u201cIf you fail often enough, you actually might become a failure \u2014 and that's different than being successful,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo the question is, how do you teach someone how to fail, but fail quickly? And to change courses as soon as you know it's a dead end?\u201d\nThe answer, according to Huang, is something called intellectual honesty. The approach is straightforward: \u201cWe assess on a continuous basis whether something makes sense or not. And if it's the wrong decision, let's change our mind.\u201d\nHe contended that to create a company capable of inventing \u201camazing things that solves problems for the world that it sometimes didn't even know it had,\u201d building a tolerance for risk-taking is crucial. At the same time, it\u2019s also essential to \u201cteach people how to fail but fail quickly and inexpensively.\u201d\nAccording to Huang, this mindset is vital because innovation is predicated on experimentation, which necessitates exploration, and exploration may lead to failure.\n\u201cUnless you have a tolerance for failure, you will never experiment and if you don't ever experiment, you will never innovate. If you don't innovate, you don't succeed,\u201d he concluded.\nHere's how you can invest in rental properties without the responsibility of being a landlord\n\u2018The biggest crash in history': Robert Kiyosaki warns that millions of 401(k)s and IRAs will be 'toast' \u2014 here's what he likes for protection\n'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling inflation\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "Title": "1 Hot Stock for 2024 With a Potential Nvidia AI Partnership",
        "Author": "  Nick Rossolillo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ: CDNS) -- a leader in semiconductor and computing system design software -- has been booming. Shares are up nearly 60% in the last 12 months, including a more than 12% increase so far in 2024. Its latest foray is with some help from artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn early February, Cadence announced a new supercomputer system called Millennium M1 that it says is powered by graphics processing units (GPUs) \"from leading providers\" -- which could certainly mean Nvidia, the de facto leader in GPU systems and a longtime Cadence collaborator.\nCadence's announcement is part of a broader trend in chip design, and AI (really, just think \"accelerated computing\" when you see those two letters) is driving the growth. Can Cadence continue its hot streak?\nThe Millennium M1 AI supercomputer is really a server, a large computing unit that can be installed either on a company's property (in an office, a private data center, etc.) or deployed in the cloud and accessed via an internet connection. Specifically, Cadence designed this computing platform for accelerating computational fluid dynamics, or CFD.\nIt's a type of analytics and simulation software used in the design of all sorts of things -- including auto engines and how cars will behave driving down the freeway, jet engines and how a plane will fly, and industrial and manufacturing processes using liquids and other materials. Really, anything that \"flows\" can be analyzed and simulated using CFD.\nCadence's Millennium Platform, powered by the Millennium M1, is the first CFD and multi-physics simulation product that uses a purpose-built supercomputer for performing such complex computations. Think of it as a turbocharged \"digital twin\" platform, enabling engineering teams to visualize how a product or project will behave in the wild, before ever manufacturing or building it.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been talking about the massive potential for digital twins for some time, especially when the metaverse was all the rage a couple of years ago. But CFD and multi-physics simulation actually has some of the most promising potential in the business world.\nCadence has been gearing up for this, even hinting at a big Nvidia product release event a year ago that it was working on big things in CFD.\nFor reference, these big moves in CFD -- really a type of convergence between the digital and physical worlds -- are why Cadence peer Synopsys\u00a0is acquiring simulation software provider Ansys, and why hardware testing company Keysight Technologies\u00a0made a simulation-software acquisition of its own last year.\nSo does Millennium give Cadence a leg up on the competition? It certainly could.\nCadence and Synopsys are the two dominant players in semiconductor design software (called EDA, or electronic design automation). Lots of new devices with chips embedded in them coming to market refill the sails of these two industry giants.\nHowever, Synopsys' move on Ansys will mean significant debt will need to be paid off if the deal is finalized (perhaps in 2025). Meanwhile, Cadence is developing its own services that converge chip design with more mechanical processes in-house. Put another way, its clean balance sheet and best-in-class profit margins will remain intact, while Synopsys will have to digest its acquisition (again, if it happens).\nAfter a stellar 2023 that featured soaring profitability, though, Cadence stock is expensive at nearly 50 times expected earnings for 2024. With a valuation like that, even a significant 20%-plus pullback in the share price won't make Cadence cheap.\nBut innovations like its new AI supercomputer, powered by GPUs and other high-end hardware and software algorithms, make Cadence a premium stock for good reason. Be patient with this investment in 2024, and consider a dollar-cost average plan if long-term ownership of Cadence Design Systems fits your portfolio needs.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cadence Design Systems right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Cadence Design Systems, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cadence Design Systems wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Louis Navellier ",
        "Text": "I\u2019m going to let you in on a little secret\u2026 I loathe short sellers.\nShort sellers are those who essentially bet that a stock will go down. They will borrow shares and then sell them on the open market \u2013 this is what it means to be \u201cshort\u201d the stock. And if the stock falls, the short seller will then buy the stock to \u201ccover\u201d their position \u2013 hopefully at a lower price, making a tidy profit in the process.\nWhen there are a lot of short sellers shorting a stock, it can cause the stock to pull back sharply. I should also add that some have no problem playing dirty by spreading nasty rumors to scare everyday investors out of a stock.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nThis is exactly what happened to NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA).\nNVDA had been on a tear for much of the year \u2013 up more than 46% by February 16. However, on Tuesday, February 20, the day before NVIDIA\u2019s all-important fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, the stock dropped as much as 6.7% on above-average volume on no major news. But the reality is that over the weekend, rumors of NVIDIA \u201cround-tripping\u201d resurfaced.\nRound-tripping is when a company pads its numbers by selling an asset to another company, only to buy it back at a similar price later on. That is a serious accusation because it is considered to be unethical and even illegal.\nIn the case of NVIDIA, it invested $872 million in 38 startups through the first nine months of 2023. This compares to $83 million invested in the first nine months in 2022. \u00a0But it was believed that NVIDIA invested to ultimately benefit itself, according to The Information:\nThese deals help Nvidia earn loyalty from leading AI companies, and, because most of them are Nvidia customers, the company stands to earn back the capital. Critics have described the way firms like Nvidia account for revenue from these startups as \u201cround tripping.\u201d\nNow, during a CNBC International interview last Tuesday, I was asked if there was any truth to the rumors.\nThis was my response\u2026\n[NVIDIA] is a real company. It keeps guiding higher. Their backlog for chips keeps getting bigger. I have no evidence of them padding anything\u2026 These short sellers are scum. If you really want to get your ratings up, I\u2019ll have to be in studio with a short seller, and we\u2019ll be on the ground when we\u2019re done with that session. These are scummy, nasty people, and I don\u2019t appreciate them taking great stocks and ruining the party.\nWell, as we now know following NVIDIA\u2019s phenomenal earnings results, its growth is quite real:\nFourth-quarter revenue soared 265% year-over-year to a record $22.1 billion.\nFourth-quarter earnings jumped 486.4% year-over-year to $5.16 per share.\nTotal revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $60.9 billion, or 126% annual revenue growth.\nFiscal year 2024 earnings came in at $12.96 per share, or 288% annual earnings growth.\nAhead of NVIDIA\u2019s earnings report, short interest stood at a whopping $18.3 billion, making the AI chip manufacturer the most heavily shorted stock in the semiconductor sector.\nBut the short sellers couldn\u2019t have been more wrong \u2013 and that triggered a major short squeeze in the stock. So, in today\u2019s Market 360, I\u2019ll review what a short squeeze is and how it impacted NVIDIA\u2019s share price. I\u2019ll also explain why short sellers should never bet against a fundamentally superior stock, and where you can find the most superior stocks.\nA short squeeze is essentially when traders who were betting that a stock was going to drop are \u201csqueezed out\u201d of the trade if the stock moves higher. In order to short the stock, they had to essentially borrow the shares on margin, and then sell them to someone else. If the stock goes too far up \u2013 and their positions go too far in the red \u2013 their brokers will come knocking to collect on this \u201cloan.\u201d\nAs a result, the short sellers are forced to close out of their positions and buy the stock, which drives the stock price even higher. Think of it like shaking a can of soda and then opening it \u2013 the soda practically spurts out and makes a huge mess!\nShort squeezes tend to be triggered by good news, like a strong earnings report, which is what we saw with NVIDIA. Thanks to the results, short sellers had to cover their positions and take a beating in the process. They lost nearly $3 billion when shares of NVIDIA swung up 15% on Thursday, according to S3 Partners.\nI\u2019ll admit, there is nothing more pleasurable in life for me other than squeezing shorts. Not to be too dramatic, but I want to destroy every single one of them, and I hope they go out of business.\nThe reason why is simple. Other than a few risk-taking individual investors, short sellers are often well-heeled hedge funds. And sometimes an easy way for them to make money is to scare regular investors out of a stock. However, earnings season can throw a wrench in their plans, because this is when a company \u2013 like NVIDIA \u2013 can prove that it does have the numbers to justify its rapid growth. Investors then know that there was no truth to the rumors and may jump back into the stock.\nThe bottom line: Never bet against a fundamentally superior stock\u2026 especially during earnings season. Earnings will come out and bury all the short sellers.\nIt\u2019s why I only invest in healthy companies with strong underlying fundamentals, sales and earnings that will drive them higher over time.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what I do in Growth Investor.\nMy Growth Investor companies are all fundamentally superior, and when they report earnings, they usually jump because there is significant future upside and not because short sellers are simply running for cover.\nIt\u2019s why my Growth Investor stocks continue to dramatically outpace the S&P 500. In the past three months, my average Growth Investor stock has surged 29.7%, while the S&P 500 has gained 14.6%. I should also add that my average Growth Investor stock posted an average earnings surprise of 8.9% after posting 17.9% average sales growth and 147.5% earnings growth. And yet, my Growth Investor stocks trade at only 18.3 times median forecasted earnings. So, they are not overvalued, which means they should continue to appreciate in value.\nInstitutional investors are now aggressively accumulating my Growth Investor stocks, which is why my stocks beat the S&P 500 by over 2-to-1 in the past three months.\nTo further position my Growth Investor Buy Lists for profits, I am adding four new stocks \u2013 three high-growth companies and one dividend play \u2013 in tomorrow\u2019s Growth Investor Monthly Issue for March.\nJoin me at Growth Investor today so you can receive my newest recommendations as soon as they\u2019re published.

        "Title": "Is Arm Holdings the Next Nvidia After Smashing Earnings Estimates?",
        "Author": "  Bradley Guichard, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There is only one Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the world's unequivocal leader in high-performance graphic processing units (GPUs) and data center hardware and software powering large swaths of the economy and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). But several companies are also doing incredible things, like Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM).\nArm's stock is up over 100% in February (as of Feb. 12), as shown below, but many investors aren't familiar with the company. I'll discuss what Arm does, its financials, and its stock below.\nFirst, here is what Arm does not do. Arm does not actually make any semiconductors (or \"chips\"). Arm sells the \"architecture\" for companies like Nvidia, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), and Samsung (OTC: SSNL.F). The list goes on, but you get the idea.\u00a0I can almost guarantee that you used an Arm-based product today because 99% of all smartphones have CPUs built with Arm technology. Here's how it works.\nArm designs the specifications for chips that are energy-efficient, high-powered, and meet its customers' specifications for the end market. The company buys the design from Arm (saving millions or billions on research and development) and pays Arm a license fee. Then, it pays Arm a royalty fee for each unit sold. As of Arm's most recent quarter, 280 billion units have shipped since its inception, including 7.7 billion in the quarter.\nBecause of the low-power, high-performance nature of Arm chips, Apple replaced Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) chips in its Macs with Arm-based chips, and Arm is used by Amazon Web Services (AWS)(NASDAQ: AMZN) server chips. Arm's superior technology is exciting investors as it increases its adoption, including in growing markets like Automotive.\nArm stock is not without risks. The company receives 20% of its revenue from China. This creates geopolitical headaches. The industry is highly competitive, and Arm is exposed to economic slowdowns because it generates more than half of its sales from mobile phones and consumer electronics. But results are encouraging.\nTotal revenue was $824 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, a 14% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Operating income was $338 million on an impressive 41% margin. Arm also has an enviable business model. Since it doesn't make the chips, its capital expenditures (equipment purchases) are very low, creating more free cash flow (FCF). Thirty cents of every revenue dollar went into the company's pocket last quarter.\nWhat really excited investors last quarter probably wasn't the 14% increase in sales, though. It was the $2.4 billion remaining performance obligation, as shown below.\nRPO is similar to a backlog. It represents contracts signed that will produce revenue in future quarters. RPO was up 38% YOY last quarter, building on the significant jump in the fiscal second quarter. This is clear evidence of increased adoption of Arm technology.\nArm stock experienced a meteoric rise after third-quarter earnings, pushing the valuation metrics off the charts. Its price-to-sales (P/S) and forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios stand at 124 and 52, respectively. Compare this to high-flying Nvidia's 40 and 35, and you can see that Arm stock will probably return to Earth soon. Investors should be cautious about buying at this level while looking for a better entry point. Arm has a tremendous future.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Arm Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Adjusted earnings amounted to\u00a087 cents, topping LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a084\u00a0cents.\nCisco expects to\u00a0its\u00a0$28 billion acquisition of machine learning and cyber security software maker Splunk\u00a0during the current, third fiscal, quarter, or early in the second calendar, which is fiscal third, quarter. EU antitrust regulators have set March 13th\u00a0as a deadline to decide whether they\u2019ll clear Cisco\u2019s bid that would help reduce its reliance on its networking equipment business that has faced both a slowdown and supply chain challenges.\nFor the current, fiscal third, quarter,\u00a0Cisco guided for 84 to 86 cents in adjusted earnings per share\u00a0and revenue in the range between\u00a0$12.1 billion\u00a0and\u00a0$12.3 billion.\nAs for the full fiscal year, Cisco guided for adjusted earnings between\u00a0$3.68\u00a0and\u00a0$3.74, and revenue between\u00a0$51.5 billion\u00a0and\u00a0$52.5 billion. However, this guidance does not account for the impact from Splunk.\nConsidering that even Microsoft, Amazon and Google kicked off the new year by slashing staff, these layoffs clearly indicate tighter times for tech companies.\u00a0With tech companies pouring billions into AI development, Cisco merely followed suit and joined Microsoft, Amazon, Google, as well as PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Duolingo Inc (NASDAQ: DUOL), with Layoffs.fyi. estimating that\u00a034,000 tech employees have been laid off\u00a0year-to-date. In January, Google dismissed hundreds of employees from hardware and internal software divisions to reverse its pandemic hiring spree. Amazon announced targeted job cuts across its film and television studio, with Audible and Buy With Prime divisions also cutting 5% of their workforce. PayPal will be reducing its workforce count by 9% this year, after announcing a 7% cut last year. After its acquisition of Activision Blizzard that will undoubtedly strengthen its position in gaming, Microsoft needed to sacrifice about 8% of its video game staff which represent less than 1% of the tech titan\u2019s total workforce. Therefore, the internet networking pioneer, Cisco, is merely doing what everyone else is. Downsizing and\u00a0layoffs are merely the cost of focusing on key priorities and growth\u00a0areas such as AI.\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "Title": "Could Qualcomm Become the Next Nvidia?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock price skyrocketed 1,750% over the past five years, turning it into the world's most valuable chipmaker, with a market cap of $1.8 trillion. That historic rally -- which was driven by soaring sales of data center GPUs for processing artificial intelligence (AI) tasks -- left Nvidia's semiconductor rivals in the dust.\nOne of those rivals was Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), which was more valuable than Nvidia nearly five years ago. Back in May 2019, Qualcomm had a market cap of $104 billion, while Nvidia was worth $103 billion. But today, Qualcomm is only worth $174 billion, making it less than a 10th as valuable as Nvidia.\nQualcomm, which drove Nvidia out of the mobile chipmaking market in 2014, is still heavily dependent on the cyclical sales of smartphones. Meanwhile, Nvidia expanded beyond its core gaming GPU business and ramped up its sales of higher-end GPUs for data centers. That forward-thinking strategy enabled it to capitalize on the rapid growth of the AI market, which kicked into high gear as generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT gained more users.\nCould Qualcomm stage a fierce comeback over the next few years and become an exciting growth stock like Nvidia again? Or will it become a slower-growth chipmaker like Texas Instruments, the type of investment that's owned for stability and income instead?\nQualcomm produces mobile system on chips (SoCs), which bundle together CPUs and GPUs for smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. It also sells stand-alone baseband modems to smartphone makers like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) that don't use its mobile SoCs. Like Nvidia, Qualcomm is a fabless chipmaker that outsources its production to third-party foundries.\nQualcomm was once the world's top mobile SoC maker, but it lost its crown to Taiwan's MediaTek over the past three years. Major smartphone makers like Apple, Samsung, and Huawei have also been developing their own first-party mobile SoCs.\nThose threats, along with the cyclical nature of the smartphone market, drove Qualcomm to develop more chips for the automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) markets. In fiscal 2023 (which ended last September), it generated 85% of its revenue from its chipmaking division -- but handset chips still accounted for 74% of that total.\nThe remaining 15% of its revenue came from its licensing division, which leverages its wireless patents to take a cut of every smartphone sold worldwide -- even if they don't use Qualcomm's chips. This business operates at much higher margins than its chipmaking segment, but it's been repeatedly challenged by handset makers and government regulators claiming its royalties and licensing fees are too high.\nQualcomm's revenue only rose 12% in fiscal 2020 as the pandemic disrupted the semiconductor sector, but surged 55% in fiscal 2021 and 32% in fiscal 2022 as those headwinds dissipated and new 5G handsets hit the market.\nBut in fiscal 2023, Qualcomm's revenue fell 19% due to the 5G upgrade cycle ending, macro headwinds throttling sales of new handsets (especially in China), and continuing struggles against MediaTek in the low-to-mid-range market. Its sales of industrial IoT chips also declined as the macro environment drove companies to rein in their spending. Its double-digit growth in automotive chip sales failed to offset all of that pressure.\nAnalysts expect Qualcomm's revenue to rise 6% in fiscal 2024 and 8% in fiscal 2025 as the smartphone market gradually recovers, it ramps up its sales of IoT and automotive chips, and the macro picture improves. But looking further ahead, Apple -- which accounted for more than 10% of Qualcomm's revenue in fiscal 2023 -- could eventually replace the chipmaker's baseband modems with its own first-party modems after 2026.\nQualcomm's loss of Apple -- along with pressure from competition, the commoditization of the smartphone market, and the slow expansion of its IoT and automotive chipmaking businesses -- will likely cause it to expand at a much slower pace than Nvidia for the foreseeable future. On the bright side, analysts expect Qualcomm's EPS to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 as it continues to streamline its spending and repurchase more shares.\nQualcomm's stock looks cheap at 16 times forward earnings and pays an attractive forward yield of 2.1%. However, it will probably remain a slower-growth semiconductor play like Texas Instruments instead of a higher-growth one like Nvidia. Qualcomm is still a decent long-term investment, but its persistent challenges and a lack of clear catalysts will likely prevent it from becoming a trillion-dollar semiconductor stock like Nvidia.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been red hot for over a year now. Up an incredible 239% in 2023, it has continued to climb more than 45% so far in 2024 already. Investors aren't averse to paying a high premium for the stock given the potential that the company possesses.\nFor long-term investors, it's hard not to like Nvidia's growth prospects. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a huge opportunity for the business and its chips, which could prove to be essential for companies developing their own AI models and chatbots.\nBut there's a big concern that I see as the stock continues to rise, and one that could derail its progress: The expectations may be far too high.\nNvidia's stock trades at nearly 100 times its trailing earnings. Even if you base it on the company's estimated future profits, the multiple is still a bit high at around 36. What investors can turn to in order to help normalize the company's earnings multiple is the price-to-earnings-growth ratio, or PEG.\nThe PEG multiple takes the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and divides it by the expected earnings growth for the business over the next five years. Nvidia's PEG ratio is less than 1, which implies that it's a good deal. If the PEG multiple is below 1, that indicates the company is expanding at a fast rate and the current P/E multiple may be justified, and that the stock is even cheap given the company's future growth prospects.\nThe problem with this conclusion, however, is that it depends heavily on analyst earnings estimates. According to analysts' expectations and data collected from Yahoo! Finance, Nvidia's growth rate will average 95% annually for five years. What this means is that if you believe Nvidia can double its revenue for five consecutive years, then yes, it's a good buy even at a P/E multiple of close to 100. The problem with that is it can create an extremely high bar for the company to have to hit.\nNvidia's growth rate has been more than doubling, however, and so it isn't outlandish to believe that it could maintain that high of a rate next year.\nBut how Nvidia will do in three or four years is more debatable. Previously, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned that people were effectively \"begging to be disappointed\" with AI's capabilities. If that turns out to be true, the risk is that the level of investment in AI that analysts and investors expect could way off base. And any drop in demand could make Nvidia's expensive stock vulnerable to a sell-off.\nNvidia is a promising stock to own because it is a leading supplier of AI chips. But at its extremely elevated price tag, it's not a stock I would buy today. If you're willing to hang on for several years, it could still be a good buy. But with expectations set so high, there's a fair amount of risk starting to creep into the stock, which could set it up for a correction in the future.\nInvestors may want to consider buying other AI stocks that can provide them with potentially more upside.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "These 2 Healthcare Stocks Are in Nvidia's Portfolio. Should They Be in Yours?",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia recently disclosed which stocks it has invested in, and while it reported a sizable position in chip designer Arm Holdings, the list also included a couple of notable healthcare companies focused on next-gen technologies. \nThe two healthcare stocks in Nvidia's portfolio are Nano-X Imaging (NASDAQ: NNOX) and Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RXRX). Let's have a closer look at what's so promising about these stocks and whether they are investments you should consider adding to your portfolio as well.\nNano-X Imaging makes X-ray beds that simplify the imaging process. The Nanox.ARC is a 3D tomosynthesis imaging system that is lightweight. The company says it can help bring \"advanced radiographic visualizations to all markets.\" It uses the Nanox.Cloud system to enhance and improve diagnostics.\nThere's the potential for the Nanox.ARC to be a game changer for hospitals around the world. According to the company's investor presentation, two-thirds of the world's population doesn't have access to medical imaging. It's a noble goal for Nano-X to help fill that void, but it still has a long road ahead.\nFor the first nine months of 2023, the company generated just $7.5 million in revenue while incurring operating expenses totaling more than $47 million. The company is still in the early stages of commercializing Nanox.ARC, and in the meantime, it's burning through plenty of cash.\nNano-X used up $32.3 million over the course of its day-to-day operating activities over the first three quarters of last year, and its cash and cash equivalents balance as of Sept. 30, 2023, was $66.4 million. So the risk of dilution is high for Nano-X, and while what the company is saying sounds promising, it could be a long road ahead before it reaches breakeven, assuming it can ever get there.\nNvidia can afford to invest in a high-risk company that's in its early growth stages, but that might not be the case for most investors. Nano-X is an intriguing healthcare stock to watch, but it's not one I'd rush out to buy right now.\nNvidia's stake in Recursion Pharmaceuticals is its largest after Arm Holdings, at just under $76 million. Last year, Nvidia announced a $50 million collaboration to work with the biotech on accelerating drug discovery, using artificial intelligence (AI) and the tech company's cloud service BioNeMo.\nRecursion presents the biological and chemical datasets, while Nvidia will use its AI, according to the biotech, to help \"create groundbreaking foundational models.\"\nWhile this also sounds promising, as does Nano-X, Recursion's business is also unproven. The company's own pipeline features programs that are no further along than phase 2 trials, and thus could still be years away from generating any meaningful revenue -- assuming they obtain regulatory approval.\nWhile Recursion does generate revenue through research and development agreements, the company is another highly risky investment. Over the first nine months of 2023, Recursion reported revenue of $33.7 million, but its operating costs were more than 8 times that tally at $284.8 million. During that time, it also burned through $213.7 million in cash over the course of its operating activities.\nInvestors should brace for stock offerings and dilution since the company's cash balance as of the end of the period totaled $397.2 million.\nRecursion is another example of a healthcare stock with high risks and high rewards that might not be suitable for most investors. And again, while Nvidia can afford to take a chance on these types of risky stocks (like Nano-X), you might be better off considering other healthcare investments instead.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nano-X Imaging right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nano-X Imaging, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nano-X Imaging wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Over the past three decades, there's always been a next-big-thing trend to captivate investors' attention. For the moment, nothing is causing more excitement within the investing community than the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nAI utilizes software and systems to oversee tasks that would normally be handled by humans. What makes AI special is the incorporation of machine learning, which is what allows software and systems to evolve and become smarter over time. With practical application across virtually all sectors and industries, artificial intelligence is expected to add more than $15 trillion to global gross domestic product (GDP) by the turn of the decade, according to researchers at PwC.\nThe astronomical dollar figures attached to AI solutions aren't lost on Wall Street or its analysts. Most analysts anticipate continued upside in AI stocks over the next year -- and that includes leading megacap stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nAccording to analyst Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital, shares of Nvidia can catapult to $1,200, which would imply 52% upside from where the stock closed on Feb. 23, 2024. This would effectively tack on $1 trillion in market cap and potentially make Nvidia the largest publicly traded company in the world.\nBaruah's optimism likely stems from Nvidia's dominant position as the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for as much as 90% of the share of GPUs used in high-compute data centers in 2024. With demand clearly outpacing supply, and Nvidia enjoying a boatload of near-term pricing power, it's been able to easily surpass Wall Street's consensus sales and profit forecasts.\nHowever, Nvidia is also set to face numerous headwinds this year. As I outlined recently, it'll be contending with growing external competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, as well as internal competition. Nvidia's two largest customers, Meta Platforms and Microsoft, are developing AI-fueled data-center chips of their own.\nWhat's more, there's the real possibility Nvidia could cannibalize its own gross margin as A100 and H100 GPU production ramps. If GPU scarcity wanes, the pricing power that's been primarily responsible for powering Nvidia's data-center sales higher could shift into reverse.\nEven though Baruah at Loop Capital believes Nvidia's stock could deliver a 52% return from where it closed last week, three other AI stocks offer higher upside, according to select Wall Street analysts.\nThe first artificial intelligence stock that at least one Wall Street analyst believes can outpace Nvidia to the upside is China-based Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU). According to Fawne Jiang at Benchmark, Baidu stock can reach $210 per share, which would imply upside of 89% relative to where it closed on February 23.\nMost investors are familiar with Baidu because of its dominant internet search engine in China. In January, Baidu accounted for 61% of internet search in the world's No. 2 economy by GDP. With few exceptions, Baidu has been responsible for between 60% and 85% of China's internet search share over the past nine years. This makes it a logical go-to for advertisers, which has helped it maintain strong ad-pricing power.\nHowever, Baidu's future is very much dependent on the success of AI. The company's AI Cloud and world-leading autonomous ride-hailing service, Apollo Go, have delivered consistently superior growth rates when compared to the company's foundational internet search segment. In particular, generative AI solutions offer businesses a means to tailor their ads to the wants and needs of specific users.\nJiang's price target of $210 isn't outrageous, either. Given Baidu's historic double-digit growth rate, its $27.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (as of Sept. 30), and its remarkably low forward-year earnings multiple of just 10, non-online marketing revenue could realistically push Baidu's stock to $210.\nAnother AI stock that may have investors completely forgetting about Nvidia is Mobileye Global (NASDAQ: MBLY), a developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving solutions. Analyst Itay Michaeli of Citigroup believes Mobileye Global stock can more than triple to $72 per share.\nNext-generation vehicles are incorporating technology like never before. Mobileye's SuperVision is currently its most-advanced ADAS offering. Though it still requires the full attention (and potential intervention) of a driver, SuperVision is a hands-off solution that can handle lane changes, accelerating and decelerating, and provide evasive maneuver assistance, and point-to-point automated navigation of an autonomous vehicle. As cars become \"smarter,\" Mobileye's solutions are bound to become more popular.\nSomething else working in Mobileye's favor is that the company was profitable on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) during the fourth quarter. Mobileye landed $7.4 billion in future orders in 2023 and also has $1.21 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the ready, as of Dec. 30, 2023. Not only should the company have little trouble sustaining a double-digit growth rate during long-winded periods of U.S. economic growth, but it has the capital needed to continue innovating.\nWhile Mobileye Global has developed undeniably exciting technology, and majority shareholder Intel would be thrilled to see its share price soar, the growing possibility of a recession taking shape in the not-too-distant future makes a $72 price target a tough sell in 2024.\nThe third AI stock that offers even more upside than Nvidia, at least based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives recently reiterated his belief that Tesla's stock can reach $315 per share, which would represent 64% upside from where shares ended on Feb. 23.\nAI solutions are critical to the EVs Tesla sells and leases. The company's Autopilot software relies on cameras, sensors, and other solutions to cull data from the car's surroundings, which are needed to make split-second driving decisions. Tesla has ridden its first-mover advantages in the EV space to become North America's leading EV manufacturer. The company produced just shy of 1.85 million EVs in 2023, while delivering its fourth consecutive year of GAAP profits.\nBut unlike Baidu, which has a very reasonable high-water price target, the lofty perch Dan Ives' price target sits atop appears unreachable due to mounting headwinds for Tesla. The company has slashed prices for Models 3, S, X, and Y on more than a half-dozen occasions since the start of 2023. These cuts are in response to weakening EV demand, fierce competition, and rising inventory levels as Tesla's production expands. Although Tesla is selling more vehicles, its operating margin has been more than halved to 8.2% in a little over a year.\nTesla's ambitions to become more than a car company have fallen flat, too. Growth in the company's Energy Generation and Storage segment has stalled on a sequential quarterly basis, while Services gross margin came in below 3% in Q4. Tesla is almost entirely reliant on selling and leasing EVs to generate a profit. This is a problem considering that Tesla trades at north of 60 times consensus earnings in 2024 in an industry known for single-digit, price-to-earnings ratios.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Baidu right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Baidu, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Baidu wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n See our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So for many budding investors, improving EPS is considered a good sign. It is awe-striking that NVIDIA's EPS went from US$2.39 to US$7.65 in just one year. Even though that growth rate may not be repeated, that looks like a breakout improvement. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that NVIDIA is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 20.4 percentage points to 46%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\nIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of NVIDIA's forecast profits?\nSince NVIDIA has a market capitalisation of US$1.8t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$71b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.\nNVIDIA's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching NVIDIA very closely. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for NVIDIA   you should know about.\nAlthough NVIDIA certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with insider buying, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have also seen recent insider buying..\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Ian King ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Computer components are not usually expected to transform entire businesses and industries, but a graphics processing unit Nvidia Corp. released in 2023 has done just that. The H100 data center chip has added more than $1 trillion to Nvidia\u2019s value and turned the company into an AI kingmaker overnight. It\u2019s shown investors that the buzz around generative artificial intelligence is translating into real revenue, at least for Nvidia and its most essential suppliers. Demand for the H100 is so great that some customers are having to wait as long as six months to receive it.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA Spike in Heart Disease Deaths Since Covid Is Puzzling Scientists\nBYD\u2019s New $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, Lamborghini\nNigeria Delivers Jumbo Rate Hike to Aid Its Battered Naira\nOffice Tower Deal for $1 Reveals Anxiety Among Longtime Buyers\n1. What is Nvidia\u2019s H100 chip?\nThe H100, whose name is a nod to computer science pioneer Grace Hopper, is a graphics processor. It\u2019s a beefier version of a type of chip that normally lives in PCs and helps gamers get the most realistic visual experience. But it\u2019s been optimized to process vast volumes of data and computation at high speeds, making it a perfect fit for the power-intensive task of training AI models. Nvidia, founded in 1993, pioneered this market with investments dating back almost two decades, when it bet that the ability to do work in parallel would one day make its chips valuable in applications outside of gaming.\n2. Why is the H100 so special?\nGenerative AI platforms learn to complete tasks such as translating text, summarizing reports and synthesizing images by training on huge tomes of preexisting material. The more they see, the better they become at things like recognizing human speech or writing job cover letters. They develop through trial and error, making billions of attempts to achieve proficiency and sucking up huge amounts of computing power in the process. Nvidia says the H100 is four times faster than the chip\u2019s predecessor, the A100, at training these so-called large language models, or LLMs, and is 30 times faster replying to user prompts. For companies racing to train LLMs to perform new tasks, that performance edge can be critical.\nListen to the Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify and the Bloomberg Terminal. Read the transcript.\n3. How did Nvidia become a leader in AI?\nThe Santa Clara, California company is the world leader in graphics chips, the bits of a computer that generate the images you see on the screen. The most powerful of those are built with hundreds of processing cores that perform multiple simultaneous threads of computation, modeling complex physics like shadows and reflections. Nvidia\u2019s engineers realized in the early 2000s that they could retool graphics accelerators for other applications, by dividing tasks up into smaller lumps and then working on them at the same time. Just over a decade ago, AI researchers discovered that their work could finally be made practical by using this type of chip.\n4. Does Nvidia have any real competitors?\nNvidia controls about 80% of the market for accelerators in the AI data centers operated by Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google Cloud and Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Azure. Those companies\u2019 in-house efforts to build their own chips, and rival products from chipmakers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp., haven\u2019t made much of an impression on the AI accelerator market so far.\n5. How does Nvidia stay ahead of its competitors?\nNvidia has rapidly updated its offerings, including software to support the hardware, at a pace that no other firm has yet been able to match. The company has also devised various cluster systems that help its customers buy H100s in bulk and deploy them quickly. Chips like Intel\u2019s Xeon processors are capable of more complex data crunching, but they have fewer cores and are much slower at working through the mountains of information typically used to train AI software. Nvidia\u2019s data center division posted an 81% increase in revenue to $22 billion in the final quarter of 2023.\n6. How do AMD and Intel compare to Nvidia?\nAMD, the second-largest maker of computer graphics chips, unveiled a version of its Instinct line in June aimed at the market that Nvidia\u2019s products dominate. The chip, called MI300X, has more memory to handle workloads for generative AI, AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su told the audience at an event in San Francisco. \u201cWe are still very, very early in the life cycle of AI,\u201d she said in December. Intel is bringing specific chips for AI workloads to the market but acknowledged that, for now, demand for data center graphics chips is growing faster than for the processor units that were traditionally its strength. Nvidia\u2019s advantage isn\u2019t just in the performance of its hardware. The company invented something called CUDA, a language for its graphics chips that allows them to be programmed for the type of work that underpins AI programs.\n7. What is Nvidia planning on releasing next?\nLater this year, the H100 will pass the torch to a successor, the H200, before Nvidia makes more substantial changes to the design with a B100 model further down the road. CEO Jensen Huang has acted as an ambassador for the technology and sought to get governments, as well as private enterprise, to buy early or risk being left behind by those who embrace AI. Nvidia also knows that once customers choose its technology for their generative AI projects, it\u2019ll have a much easier time selling them upgrades than competitors hoping to draw users away.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations\nHong Kong\u2019s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen\nTranscript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?\nThe High Cost of Eating Out in America\nCan the Masters of Hipster Cringe Conquer Hollywood With Wall Street Cash?\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia crushed expectations with a bumper quarterly earnings report on Wednesday, reporting a 265% increase in revenue from the same period a year ago, sending shares up over 9% in extended trading. CEO Jensen Huang said Nvidia now has to \"allocate [chips] fairly\" as customers flock to its processors, key to the AI boom. \"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,\" Huang said.\nBut amidst the blowout quarter, Nvidia also acknowledged how tensions between the U.S. and China, particularly over semiconductors, is affecting its business. China now represents \"mid-single digit percentage\" of Nvidia's data center revenue, chief financial officer Collette Kress said on Wednesday. She suggested that China would make up a similar percentage of revenue for the current quarter as well. (Data center revenue aligns with Nvidia's AI chip business)\nIt's a significant drop: Nvidia has previously noted that China made up as much as a quarter of the company's data center revenue.\nThe U.S. first announced controls on the sales of advanced semiconductors to China in October 2022. Companies like Nvidia then developed chips that complied with the restrictions yet still offered the same advanced capabilities. The Biden administration updated its restrictions last October to close that loophole.\nOn Thursday, Kress admitted that the U.S. government has not granted a license to Nvidia to ship restricted products to China. Nvidia has started shipping alternative products to China that don't require a license, she continued.\nHuang said Nvidia has \"immediately paused\" and \"reset\" its product offerings in China, which he blamed for the drop in data center revenue from China. The company would do its best to succeed in the Chinese market \"within the specifications of U.S. restrictions\", he said.\nNvidia is again trying to develop chips for the Chinese market that comply with U.S. restrictions, but Chinese customers are reportedly turning to domestic alternatives instead. Chinese tech companies are less interested in buying Nvidia's downgraded products, which are now closer in performance to cheaper Chinese options, the Wall Street Journal reports. Chinese chipmakers are pitching their own chips as a safer option due to the possibility of new controls from the U.S., Reuters reported in December.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "There's no getting around it: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a rock star among the Wall Street set since the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution kicked off just over a year ago. In fact, since the beginning of 2023, shares of the semiconductor company have soared nearly 441%.\nOne Wall Street analyst believes there's still much more to come.\nRosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann, the self-professed \"most bullish analyst on Nvidia,\" boosted his price target to $1,400 while maintaining a buy rating on the stock. That represents potential gains for investors of 78% from where the shares traded as of market close on Friday.\nThe analyst cites Nvidia's fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results, released just last week, as the catalyst for his bullish call. The semiconductor specialist delivered triple-digit, year-over-year growth for the third consecutive quarter, and its guidance suggested more of the same.\nThe analyst points out that \"Nvidia remains sold out for the [fiscal year].\" Furthermore, Mosesmann suggests there's likely much more to come, saying, \"We are in the very early innings of what we call the Mother of All Cycles.\"\nMost market commentators agree with the analyst's assertion that we're still we're still in the early innings when it comes to the adoption of generative AI. If that's the case -- and I believe that it is -- Nvidia has two advantages that could drive its stock even higher.\nFirst, Nvidia has a virtual monopoly on the graphics processing units (GPUs) used in the data center market -- where most AI processing takes place -- with a market share estimated at 95%. Second, Nvidia made a name for itself as the go-to for machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI -- with a market share of 95% in that market.\nTo be clear, the days of easy triple-digit comps will soon be in the rearview mirror, but AI is just getting started. And with a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock -- Nvidia is still remarkably cheap compared to its opportunity.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n See our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So for many budding investors, improving EPS is considered a good sign. It is awe-striking that NVIDIA's EPS went from US$2.39 to US$7.65 in just one year. Even though that growth rate may not be repeated, that looks like a breakout improvement. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that NVIDIA is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 20.4 percentage points to 46%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\nIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of NVIDIA's forecast profits?\nSince NVIDIA has a market capitalisation of US$1.8t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$71b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.\nNVIDIA's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching NVIDIA very closely. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for NVIDIA   you should know about.\nAlthough NVIDIA certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with insider buying, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have also seen recent insider buying..\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.NVIDIA\u2019s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company\u2019s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.NVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company\u2019s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company\u2019s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.Santa Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024, up 126% from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023.Beginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments \u2013 Graphics and Compute & Networking.Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.Compute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.Graphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 22% and 78% of fiscal 2024 revenues, respectively.\nBottom Line\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Nvidia ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in March 2014 would be worth $172,169.75, or a 17,116.97% gain, as of March 1, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 174.07% and gold's return of 48.34% over the same time frame.\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for NVDA.\nNVIDIA's Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. The stock has outperformed the industry year to date. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 25.52%, and there have been 13 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Semiconductor stocks have been on fire over the past year or so as the sector received a nice shot in the arm from rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, which explains why shares of chip giant Nvidia have jumped a whopping 216% in the past year.\nNvidia boasts a 92% share of the data center GPU (graphics processing unit) market, and that dominant position has led to outstanding growth in the company's revenue and earnings in recent quarters. It could also lead to another solid year of growth for Nvidia given the massive opportunity in AI chips.\nAccording to a forecast by investment banking firm Raymond James, the market for chips powering generative AI applications could double in 2024. Given Nvidia's position in that market, that growth should translate into a huge revenue bump: Third-party estimates foresee the company generating $76 billion in data center revenue this year. That would be a substantial jump over the $44 billion data center revenue Nvidia may have clocked in its fiscal 2024 (which ended Jan. 31).\nHowever, Nvidia is not the only way to capitalize on the AI chip market. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur believes that chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) could become the second-largest supplier of AI semiconductor chips this year.\nThe JPMorgan analyst has an overweight rating on Broadcom stock with a price target of $1,550 -- more than 20% above current levels. According to Sur, the chipmaker could generate AI revenue of $8 billion to $9 billion in 2024 thanks to its dominant position in the market for custom chips, especially high-end application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) deployed for AI workloads.\nAccording to JPMorgan, Broadcom reportedly commands a 35% share of the high-end ASIC market. This puts it well ahead of second-place Marvell Technology, which has a 12% market share. Broadcom's solid position means that it is well-placed to make the most of a fast-growing opportunity.\nThe market for high-end custom ASICs was reportedly worth $13 billion to $18 billion in 2023. This market is expected to clock annualized growth of 20% in the long run as more companies look to manufacture custom AI chips. The good part is that Broadcom has reportedly built a solid pipeline of customers for its custom chips, reportedly landing two to three major deals last year.\nBroadcom has been involved in designing every generation of Google's tensor processing units (TPUs), and also counts the likes of Microsoft and Meta Platforms as customers. It is worth noting that all these companies have been working on custom chips to train AI models efficiently and cost-effectively.\nNot surprisingly, Broadcom's AI revenue has been growing at a nice pace of late. The company sold $1.5 billion worth of generative AI chips in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2023 (which ended on Oct. 29), which was 16% of its total revenue. That translates into an annual revenue run rate of $6 billion. So JPMorgan's estimate that Broadcom could generate $8 billion to $9 billion in AI chip revenue this year points toward a potential jump of 33% to 50% based on its annual revenue run rate last quarter.\nAnalysts anticipate Broadcom's revenue will increase by almost 40% in its fiscal 2024 to $50 billion, including a $12 billion contribution from VMware, which it recently acquired. The stock currently trades at 14.6 times sales following a 105% spike in the past year.\nStill, it is significantly cheaper than Nvidia, which trades at 38 times sales. Of course, Nvidia can justify its steep valuation thanks to its sizable AI business, which is much bigger than Broadcom's. However, conservative investors may want to look for cheaper AI chip plays, which is where Broadcom comes in.\nThe company enjoys a healthy market share in custom AI chips, a market that's expected to grow at a solid pace in the long run. Also, if Broadcom does hit $50 billion in revenue this year and maintains its current sales multiple, its market cap could increase to $730 billion. That would be a 25% jump from current levels. That indicates that it isn't too late for investors to buy this AI stock, despite the terrific gains it has clocked in the past year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Built on the Now Platform, Now Assist for Telecommunications Service Management leverages NVIDIA AI to help boost agent productivity, speed time to resolution, and enhance time to value.\nBARCELONA, Spain, February 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mobile World Congress: ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the leading digital workflow company making the world work better for everyone, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today announced that they are broadening their relationship with the introduction of telco-specific generative AI solutions to elevate service experiences.\nThe first solution, Now Assist for Telecommunications Service Management (TSM), is built on the Now Platform and uses NVIDIA AI to help boost agent productivity, speed time to resolution, and enhance customer experiences. As telcos look to reduce costs and uncover new business opportunities, they\u2019re turning to AI and automation.

        "Text": "By Carolina Mandl\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Bridgewater Associates increased its stake in chipmaker Nvidia by 458% at the end of last year while also adding exposure to other members of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of growth and technology stocks that have driven markets higher, filings showed on Wednesday.\nThe hedge fund founded by billionaire Ray Dalio increased its stake in Nvidia, the world's most valuable chipmaker, to 268,489 shares. The position was valued at $133 million at the end of December.\nNvidia, whose shares have already risen 47% this year, briefly overtook Google-parent Alphabet's stock market capitalization to become the third-biggest U.S. company on Wednesday, with a market capitalization of over $1.8 trillion.\nBridgewater also bought roughly 500,000 new shares in Alphabet, bringing its total to 2 million shares at the end of the fourth quarter, valued at $286 million. The hedge fund also added a few more shares in Meta, bringing its position to 666,059 shares, while it acquired a comparatively small new position in Apple, of 1,109 shares, and roughly maintained its exposure to Microsoft at 197,732 shares.\nThe positions were revealed in securities filings known as 13-fs, which hedge funds and other institutional investors file at the end of each quarter. While they are backward-looking and do not reveal current holdings or short positions, the filings are one of the few ways to see the portfolios of often-secretive funds.\nAlphabet shares are up 4% this year, while Meta\u2019s have risen 33%. Tesla and Apple are down this year 24.6% and 5%, respectively.\nBridgewater also bought more shares in Eli Lilly, which is one of the makers of the popular new weight-loss drugs. Its shares are up 29% this year. Bridgewater added 255,619 new shares of Eli Lilly in the last quarter of 2023 and now holds 317,586 shares.\n(Reporting by Carolina Mandl in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), the $1.96 trillion chipmaker, continued riding the artificial intelligence wave, nearly tripling its year-over-year revenue while beating analysts' profit expectations and lifting an entire category of exchange-traded funds.\nNvidia shares jumped to a record, adding $110.66, or 16%, to close at $785.38. The shares have more than tripled over the past year.\nAccording to etf.com data, 484 exchange-traded funds hold Nvidia and most of them jumped today. The biggest holder is Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), with a $36.5 billion stake. That fund moved 1.5%. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which has 25% of its assets in the stock, rose 6.7%. The biggest allocation belongs to the leveraged T-Rex 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF (NVDX), which, aiming to double the return on Nvidia shares, jumped 30% today.\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company's earnings report last night was widely anticipated by investors and the company didn't disappoint, beating top and bottom-line estimates in and boosting its future expectations for profit and revenue.\nIt\u2019s not an overstatement to say that the near-term direction of the stock market, especially tech-heavy exchange-traded funds, will continue to be significantly impacted by Nvidia, the world\u2019s leading artificial intelligence company.\nAdding to the drama, growth stocks, which are under closer investor scrutiny for their high valuations, and are more interest rate-sensitive than their value stock counterparts, face larger hurdles in 2024 than in 2023. Today, NVDA and other mega-cap growth stocks face the \u201chigher for longer\u201d Fed rate expectations following a hotter-than-expected January CPI report, as well as the S&P 500 recently crossing the 5,000 level for the first time in its history. \nHigh expectations were met for the Mag 7 tech stock, which had beaten earnings estimates in 19 of the last 20 quarters, according to Nasdaq.\nThe ETFs that will be impacted the most following the Nvidia earnings call are funds with the heaviest exposure to NVDA, most notably the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) at nearly 25% allocation weight, and the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) at 20%.\nOver the past year, SMH has jumped 67% in price while BOTZ is up 27%, as of Feb. 16, 2024, with the lions\u2019 share of those gains being attributed to NVDA\u2019s gain of over 200% in this 12-month period. A less-than-stellar earnings report from Nvidia this week would place downside pressure on these ETFs and an earnings miss would likely push these funds sharply lower.\nTo demonstrate the NVDA impact on ETFs, compare the 1-year gain of 25% for the cap-weighted SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) to the 8% gain for the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), which gives the same allocation to each of the index\u2019s constituents. The cap-weighted Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), which allocates roughly 40% of its portfolio to NVDA and other Magnificent 7 stocks, is up 44% over the past year.\nIn other words, high exposure to the NVDA-led Mag 7 translated to much higher returns over the past year, but if you reduce exposure to NVDA and the other Mag 7 stocks, your return declines by two-thirds or more.\nAs markets progress through 2024, broad market indexes like the S&P 500 index, and especially AI ETFs and the broader technology sector, will likely need Nvidia and the other Magnificent 7 stocks to continue to exceed investor expectations to maintain stocks wider bull run. These stocks and ETFs will also need a helping hand from an economic soft landing, which would combine lower inflation and slower but modest growth in the U.S. economy.\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "Title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The market expects Nvidia (NVDA) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 21, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +412.5%.\nRevenues are expected to be $20.18 billion, up 233.5% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.88% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nvidia?\nFor Nvidia, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.26%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\nSo, this combination indicates that Nvidia will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of $3.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.02, delivering a surprise of +19.64%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nNvidia appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Missed Out on Nvidia and Arm? This AI Stock Still Looks Cheap",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Two of the biggest names in artificial intelligence (AI) of late have been chip powerhouses Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares of the former have soared 70% so far this year while the latter is coming off an exceptional 2023 during which its value skyrocketed by nearly 239% en route to making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. For investors looking to take advantage of the growth opportunities within AI, it may seem like it's too late to invest in the best players.\nBoth Arm and Nvidia are likely to keep growing, but investors may not be too keen on buying them at their current valuations. But not all AI stocks trade at a huge premium today. One that still looks relatively cheap is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), better known as TSMC.\nTSMC is the world's leading third-party semiconductor foundry, and its business can benefit significantly from an uptick in demand for chips. The company projects that this year, its top line could grow by more than 20% as it benefits from strong demand for higher-end chips. CEO C.C. Wei sees the business playing a big role in the future of AI: \"We are a key enabler for AI applications. So far today, everything you saw for AI comes from TSMC.\"\nTSMC's projected revenue growth is encouraging. The company has been battling headwinds due to a slowdown in demand for consumer electronics, and AI could give it a much-needed growth catalyst. Its revenue for Q4 2023 totaled $19.6 billion -- down 1.5% year over year. But on a quarter-over-quarter basis, revenue and profits were up 14% and 13%, respectively. The company does appear to be on a much stronger trajectory.\nBased on analysts' expectations of future profits, TSMC's stock is fairly cheap, trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of just 20. That looks like a bargain compared to both Nvidia and Arm.\nThere are, however, a couple of reasons investors may have chosen shares of Nvidia or Arm instead of TSMC. The first is that TSMC is based in Taiwan, so there's some geopolitical risk there to consider. That may be keeping investors away despite TSMC's potential.\nSecondly, the company recently pushed back the timelines on the new factories it is building in Arizona. TSMC is investing $40 billion to build two manufacturing facilities there. The first, originally intended to be operational in 2024, won't be until 2025 -- due, the company says, to its inability to find enough workers with the specialized skills the fab requires. The second fab now won't come online until 2027 or 2028; it was previously expected to be operational by 2026. While these factories are still being built, the delays may have dissuaded investors from investing in TSMC stock right now.\nWhether you're a frequent tech sector investor or are simply bullish on AI stocks, TSMC can be a great way to invest in technology. The semiconductor giant has been facing headwinds due to slowing consumer demand, but those aren't long-term issues. Once they subside, the company could benefit from both strong AI demand and a resurgence in demand for consumer electronics. In the long run, TSMC has the potential to join Nvidia and others in the $1 trillion market cap club.\nAt a relatively modest valuation, it could be one of the better AI stocks to buy right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is set to release earnings results for its fourth quarter, after the closing bell on Feb. 21, 2024.\nAnalysts expect the company to report quarterly earnings at $4.64 per share, up sharply from year-ago earnings of 88 cents per share. The company is projected to post revenue of $20.62 billion for the latest quarter, compared to $6.05 billion in the year-earlier quarter, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia\u2019s stock experienced a sharp decline of up to 6.7%, just a day before the company\u2019s highly anticipated earnings report. This dip could be attributed to profit-taking ahead of the earnings release, according to the host of CNBC's \"Mad Money, Jim Cramer.

As of now, Nvidia has a dividend yield of 0.02%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 4 cents a share (16 cents a year).\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Nvidia dividends, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Nvidia\u2019s $0.16 dividend: $6,000 / $0.16 = 37,500 shares\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $26,044,500 worth of Nvidia, or 37,500 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.16 = 7,500 shares, or $5,208,900 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\nView more earnings on NVDA\nAlso Read:  Top 4 Tech And Telecom Stocks That May Crash In January \nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\nNVDA Price Action: Shares of Nvidia fell 4.4% to close at $694.52 on Tuesday.\nRead More: This Jeff Bezos-backed platform has made real estate investing as easy as ordering stuff on Amazon.

        "Text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Nvidia Corp., which has seen its value skyrocket over the past year thanks to soaring demand for its graphics chips used for artificial intelligence, posted stronger-than-expected results Wednesday for its latest quarter, with its revenue more than tripling from a year earlier.\nNvidia reported revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter that ended Jan. 28 of $22.1 billion, up from $6.05 billion.\nThe company based in Santa Clara, California, earned $12.29 billion, compared to a profit of $1.41 billion a year ago.\nAdjusted for one-time items, Nvidia earned $5.16 a share in the latest quarter, that topped Wall Street forecasts for $4.59 per share, based on analysts surveyed by FactSet Research. Analysts had expected revenue of $20.4 billion for the period that concluded the company\u2019s fiscal year.\nThe company's specialized chips are key components that help power different forms of artificial intelligence, including the latest generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.\n\u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, in a statement. \u201cDemand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\u201d\nNvidia carved out an early lead in the hardware and software needed to tailor its technology to AI applications, partly because Huang began to nudge the company into what was then seen as a still half-baked technology more than a decade ago. It also makes chips for gaming and cars.\nHuang looked at ways that Nvidia chipsets known as graphics processing units might be tweaked for AI-related applications to expand beyond their early inroads in video gaming.\n\u201cAnother blockbuster quarter from Nvidia raises the question of how long its soaring performance will last,\" said Insider Intelligence analyst Jacob Bourne. \u201cIt has a massive lead in the growing global AI chip sector but can\u2019t rest on its laurels.\u201d\nBourne said Nvidia faces a number of challenges, including broader economic uncertainty, tech giants\u2019 drive to make their own AI chips and emerging rivals. But he said the company's market strength, for the near future, is \u201cdurable\u201d\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia expects revenue of about $24 billion. Analysts are currently expecting Nvidia to post revenue of $22.2 billion for the February-April period. The company expects \u201ccontinued growth\u201d to 2025 and beyond.\nThe company said its data center revenue grew in all regions except China, where the U.S. government has imposed export regulations.\n\u201cAlthough we have not received licenses from the U.S. government to ship restricted products to China, we have started shipping alternatives that don\u2019t require a license for the China market,\u201d Huang said in a conference call with analysts.\nNvidia relies heavily on the world's biggest maker of computer chips, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, to churn out the chips that Nvidia designs.\nTaiwan\u2019s Taiex benchmark index last week jumped 3% to a record high, buoyed by a surge in TSMC's share price.\nThe leap came after Morgan Stanley analysts raised their price target on Nvidia's stock to $750 from $603, citing an increase in demand for AI chips.\n\u201cGenerative AI has kicked off a whole new investment cycle to build the next $1 trillion of infrastructure of AI generation factories,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWe believe these two trends will drive a doubling of the world\u2019s data center infrastructure installed base in the next five years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions.\u201d\nNvidia's shares jumped 7.5%, to $726 in after-hours trading.\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia's stock price is \"frothy\" and is at unsustainable highs, one analyst said.\nThe stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 97, far more than all of its trillion-dollar peers.\nThe company's chipmaker peers like Taiwan Semiconductors haven't seen the same type of gains.\nWhat goes up must come down \u2014 and Nvidia, which has been forging upwards in a seemingly unstoppable rally, has got to come down eventually, one analyst said.\n\"I think the price that it's at right now is very, very, very hard to maintain,\" Cleo Capital's Sarah Kunst said in a CNBC interview. While other tech stocks have seen huge gains over the last few weeks, they're \"foamy,\" but Nvidia is \"frothy,\" Kunst agreed with the interviewer.\nThe stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 97, which essentially means investors are willing to pay 97 times the price for the reward that could be earned per share. That is far more than all of its trillion-dollar peers, Kunst said.\nNvidia has enjoyed an astronomical boom over the last few months, with a stock price that is up 224.64% in the past year, and a valuation that has relentlessly risen. Its shares have been boosted by the rapidly growing AI industry, which requires chips like those made by Nvidia, to the point that it has become the 3rd largest US company, behind only Microsoft and Apple.\nBut even if there's a perfectly logical reason for why the stock is up, it still doesn't explain the magnitude of Nvidia's meteoric rise. After all, other semiconductor companies like Taiwan Semiconductors are doing much better on the fundamentals, Kunst said. And across the broader market, stocks are up \u2014 but not unsustainably high like Nvidia. The reason why, Kunst said, is optimism.\n\"The reality is right now that things are up,\" she said. \"There was so much cash sitting on the sidelines last year waiting for this big crashing downturn \u2014 that, knock on all of the wood, we have hopefully avoided. People want to put that cash back in.\"\nTo be fair, the fact that a big name like Nvidia is soaring in a market that is, on balance, rallying, isn't a bad thing, Kunst added.\n\"People right now are really looking for innovation,\" she said. \"We see everything \u2014 from the Novo Nordisk's of the world to the Uber's \u2014 we see them go up right now because that's what people want to invest in.\"\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Author": "  Ian King ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. rose the most in about nine months after the chipmaker delivered another eye-popping sales forecast, adding fresh momentum to a stock rally that already made it the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBYD\u2019s New $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, Lamborghini\nStock Rally Stalls at Start of Data-Packed Week: Markets Wrap\nFreddie Mercury\u2019s London Residence Lists at \u00a330 Million\nJacob Rothschild, Financier and Philanthropist, Dies at 87\nPoland\u2019s Famously Frank Top Diplomat Lands a Blow With Rebuff of Russia\nRevenue in the current period will be about $24 billion, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Analysts had predicted $21.9 billion on average. Results in the fourth quarter also sailed past Wall Street estimates.\nThe outlook extends a streak of Nvidia shattering expectations, thanks to insatiable demand for its artificial intelligence accelerators \u2014 highly prized chips that crunch data for AI models. The technology has helped power a proliferation of chatbots and other generative AI services, which can create text and graphics based on simple prompts.\n\u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in the statement. \u201cDemand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\u201d\nThe shares jumped 16% to $785.38 as the close Thursday in New York, a record high and the biggest single-day increase since May.\nNvidia\u2019s market capitalization has now increased by more than $650 billion this year \u2014 bringing its valuation to $1.89 trillion \u2014 as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.\nThat turned Wednesday\u2019s report into a highly anticipated event for both Wall Street and the tech world. And the numbers \u2014 along with the upbeat tone from Huang \u2014 renewed confidence that spending will stay strong.\nShares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. \u2014 three other chipmakers expected to benefit from AI growth \u2014 also gained on Thursday.\n\u201cThe entire market is watching this report and expectations have been elevated,\u201d Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso said in a note. Guidance was strong enough to \u201cdemonstrate continued momentum, while also leaving room for continued upside through the second half.\u201d\nNew Cycle\nOn a conference call with analysts, Huang said that demand for Nvidia\u2019s newest products will continue to outstrip supply for the rest of the year. Though supply is growing, demand isn\u2019t showing any signs of slowing, he said.\n\u201cGenerative AI has kicked off a whole new investment cycle,\u201d Huang said. That will lead to a doubling of the world\u2019s data center installed base over the next five years and \u201crepresent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions,\u201d he said.\nNvidia, co-founded by Huang in 1993, got its start as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. Its profile blew up in the last two years, when its technology proved adept at handling heavy AI workloads. The company\u2019s H100 accelerators have become legendary in the tech world, with customers scrambling to get their hands on as many as possible.\nCompanies such as Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google are Nvidia\u2019s largest customers, accounting for nearly 40% of its revenue, as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Jan 28, Nvidia\u2019s revenue more than tripled to $22.1 billion. Profit excluding certain items was $5.16 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $20.4 billion and earnings of $4.60 a share. Underscoring the magnitude of its recent growth streak: As recently as 2021, Nvidia didn\u2019t generate that much revenue in an entire year.\nNvidia\u2019s data center division, now by far its largest source of sales, generated $18.4 billion of revenue, up 409% from the same period a year earlier. Gaming chips provided $2.87 billion of sales.\nNvidia is now working to spread its AI technology beyond the big data-center companies. Huang, 61, has traveled the globe arguing that governments and corporations need their own AI systems \u2014 both to protect their data and gain a competitive advantage.\nNvidia announced a deal with Cisco Systems Inc. earlier this month that gives it a new distribution channel. As part of that deal, Cisco, the world\u2019s biggest provider of networking gear, will help sell complete AI systems to companies.\nRead More: Nvidia, Cisco to Help Companies Build In-House AI Computing\nBut Nvidia faces risks, including mounting competition and a push by some customers to develop their own AI chips.\nAMD recently began selling a line of accelerators called the MI300. It expects to get revenue of $3.5 billion from that product this year, up from an earlier projection of $2 billion. Nvidia isn\u2019t standing still, though. Analysts expect the company to soon unveil more powerful accelerators.\nNvidia also has had to navigate new export rules for chips headed to China, the largest market for semiconductors. The company has scaled down the capabilities of its products in order to continue to sell to that region, which in the past has accounted for a quarter of revenue. Three months ago, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told analysts that the company\u2019s projections would have been higher if it weren\u2019t for the China rules.\nIn terms of data center revenue, China accounted for a mid-single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter. \u201cWe expect it to stay in a similar range in the first quarter,\u201d Kress said Wednesday.\nThe company has begun sending samples of new chips that are compliant with restrictions to Chinese customers, Huang said. That should help business pick up again.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in the marketplace,\u201d Huang said.\n(Updates with closing shares in the fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations\nThe High Cost of Eating Out in America\nTranscript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?\nWhy Elon Musk Bought Twitter in the First Place\nCan the Masters of Hipster Cringe Conquer Hollywood With Wall Street Cash?\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Josh Schafer    \u00b7 Reporter",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) once again surpassed Wall Street's lofty expectations with its latest earnings report.\nFor the quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion. The numbers represent significant increases from last year's results in the same period. Earnings rose more than 486% while revenue was up more than 262%.\nThe company also guided higher than analysts' expectations for the first quarter, saying it anticipates revenue of $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $21.9 billion for the quarter.\nWall Street reacted with a slew of boosted price targets and overall bullish sentiment on the stock that rose double digits on Thursday following its earnings release. The median price target on the stock rose 19% following the report.\nBelow is a collection of comments Wall Street is making about Nvidia after its fourth quarter earnings release.\nToshiya Hari, Goldman Sachs, Buy rating, price target $875 (from $800) \n\"Nvidia delivered against what was seemingly a very high bar with Data Center once again serving as the key growth driver. Looking ahead, despite the [greater than three times year-over-year] increase in Data Center revenue in FY2024, we model another [greater than two times year-over-year] increase in FY2025 as we expect not only sustained growth in Gen AI infrastructure spending by the large [communication service providers] and consumer internet companies, but also increased development and adoption of AI across enterprise customers representing various industry verticals and, increasingly, sovereign states.\"\nVedvati Shrotre, Jefferies, Buy rating, price target $780 (from $610)\n\"We've observed that computing eras are typically dominated by a single ecosystem that is provided by a single, vertically integrated chip+hardware+software company, like IBM in mainframes and Apple in smartphones. NVDA's strong commentary regarding use for GPUs for inference and training workloads foots with our field checks that NVDA has become the AI ecosystem of choice. We think many investors continue to underestimate the amount of investment NVDA has poured into its ecosystem, and the lead that has given the company in the market, which has translated to a virtuous circle of software developers and platform suppliers embracing NVDA as the ecosystem of choice for AI workloads.\"\nVivek Arya, Bank of America, Buy rating, price target $925 (from $800)\n\"Perhaps the most important new datapoint in NVDA's earnings call was that AI inference contributed nearly 40% of AI computing mix in FY24/CY23. AI inference is correlated with revenue bearing AI which is supposed to be more competitive, as opposed to AI training which NVDA already dominates. Second, we highlight the company's positive commentary around tight supply, low China dependence (only mid-single digit percent of data center sales versus 20%-25% prior to restrictions), new pipeline, rising sovereign demand for AI among others.\"\nTimothy Arcuri, UBS Investment Bank, Buy rating, price target $800 (from $800)\n\"There were a few items that could maybe suggest some slowing revenue growth on the horizon (mostly supply and opex) but we will have to see how these evolve. The bottom line is that we are still in such early stages of what is possible with AI (especially health care/drug discovery) and NVDA is the de-facto global AI platform, it seems too soon to take a more cautious view. We are trimming estimates a bit to reflect some potential slowing in revenue growth and price target goes from $850 to $800 but we maintain our Buy.\"\nHarlan Sur, JPMorgan, Overweight rating, price target $850 (from $650)\n\"The [Nividia] team noted that demand will continue to outstrip supply through CY24, allaying fears of an inventory build/correction in the 2H of the year. The team feels constructive on the sustained growth into CY25+ driven by transition to accelerated computing, proliferation of generative AI applications, and build-out of sovereign AI.\n\"The team provided examples of the strong AI monetization from their customers ( e.g. ServiceNow drove their largest ever net-new annual contract value contribution, Microsoft 365 Copilot grew faster in its first two months than the two previous major Microsoft 365 enterprise suite).\"\nAtif Malik, Citi analyst, Buy rating, price target $820\n\"Nvidia expects AI demand to remain strong and above supply through the year. China was down sharply due to US restrictions ... Inference sales were 40% of data center sales last year and the company expects data center infrastructure installed base of $1T to double over the next five years. While [year-over-year] data center comps could pose a headwind for the stock, long-term earnings power looks attractive based on our $200B compute TAM by 2027.\"\nGil Luria, D.A. Davidson, Neutral rating, price target $620\n\"While FY2025 will be a terrific year for NVIDIA, we believe that FY2026 and beyond may not see continued growth. Messaging from the four largest customers suggests that they're accelerating spend this year to meet current demand but are characterizing their purchasing as demand-driven, implying the possibility of scaling down compute spend once we approach the trough of disillusionment. We believe that customers like Microsoft are not interested in indefinitely sustaining this level of Capex dedicated solely to AI compute, yet alone NVIDIA. Consequently, we believe our FY26 and FY27 estimates reflect a Street low, as we see potential for a sequential decline in NVIDIA's data center business starting sometime over the next 4-6 quarters. We are raising our target to $620 from $410 to reflect a higher cyclical peek this year than we previously estimated.\"\nRuben Roy, Stifel, Buy rating, price target $910 (from $865)\n\"As questions regarding the sustainability of NVDA's growth increase, we found management commentary on revenue diversification notable. In addition to continued growth of Networking and Software NVDA's overall Data Center revenue is increasingly diversifying across industries and regions, including a growing contribution from demand related to sovereign AI deployments. This diversification, in our view, is likely to continue as AI-related [return on investment] for end users accelerates. NVDA continues to believe that the migration from general purpose compute to accelerated compute represents a $1 trillion opportunity, longer-term ... We continue to expect NVDA to be the primary beneficiary of AI infrastructure deployments over the next several years. Despite supply improvements across NVDA\u2019s product set, management continues to see strong demand over the medium-term with expectations for demand to continue to outstrip supply of new products.\"\nAnanda Baruah, Loop Capital, Buy rating, price target $1,200 \n\"We believe NVDA could be looking at a $150B GPU opportunity in CY2024. A key difference in our view vs. Street (we believe) is our work regarding high-end Data Center GPUs where we see NVDA tracking towards 5.0M for CY2024/FY2025 and 6.5M+ for CY2025/FY2026. It is our belief that Street (through investor conversations) is positioned at 4.0M \u2013 4.5M TOTAL Enterprise & Data Center GPUs for CY2024 / FY2025.\"\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated Toshiya Hari's first name.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, down 0.3% on the heels of Tuesday's declines.\nStocks are lagging, with the focus fixed on looming results from Nvidia, whose shares fell almost 3% on Tuesday for their worst day since Oct. 17 as investors positioned for the release. The stock extended that loss on Wednesday, falling more than 3% heading into its earnings release. Expectations are running high for the chipmaker's fourth quarter results, seen both as a barometer for the AI trade and as a potential turning point for stocks more broadly.\nThe market is on edge for any disappointment in the report, expected after the bell. Nvidia is one of a small group of megacaps behind a big chunk of recent gains for stock indexes. Mixed prospects for growth among those \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have prompted hedge funds to cut holdings, according to Goldman Sachs.\nIn corporates, shares of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) tumbled over 28% after the cybersecurity provider cut its annual revenue forecast, igniting concerns about a potential pullback in tech spending. Meanwhile, Walgreens shares (WBA) slid as much as 3% after the pharmacy giant lost its spot on the blue-chip Dow index to Amazon (AMZN).\nMinutes from the Fed's January meeting released on Wednesday showed most Fed officials \"noted the risks of moving too quickly\" in easing interest rates during the most recent meeting. Recent discouraging data has prompted a wavering in conviction that the central bank will cut rates in June, seen as the most probable timing.\nAfter the closing bell, Nvida reported fourth quarter earnings, and first quarter revenue guidance, that exceeded Wall Street's lofty expectations. The company guided for first quarter revenue of $24 billion plus or minus 2%, above Wall Street's projections for $21.9 billion. Shares rose as much as 7% in after hours trading.\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nNvidia reported fourth quarter earnings that topped Wall Street's lofty expectations on Wednesday afternoon but noted its data sales to China declined significantly.\nThe company's fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $5.16 topped analyst expectations for $4.64. Meanwhile, fourth quarter revenue of $22.1 billion came in higher than analyst projections for $20.4 billion.\nThe company also guided higher than analysts' expectations for the first quarter, saying it anticipates revenue of $24 billion plus or minus 2%.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, down 0.3% on the heels of Tuesday's declines.\nEarnings results from the AI leader Nvidia (NVDA) are set to hit the tape after the close on Wednesday. As we've covered extensively over the last few days, these results are expected to be a litmus test for the AI narrative, and perhaps the current market rally as whole. \nGiven the stock's more than 200% rise over the past year, even if the company tops its massive expectations, the attractiveness of the stock trading near all-time highs will serve as a signal of investors' risk appetite.\nBut Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni cautioned that investors shouldn't read too far into Wednesday's report, even if it proves to be a market moving event.\n\"It's a very short-term story,\" Yardeni said.\nYardeni, who has a 5,400 year-end target on the S&P 500 for 2024 and sees the benchmark index reaching 6,500 by the end of 2026, believes AI will play a role in that rise. But it's not the whole story.\n\"[Nvidia's report] is obviously viewed as a big deal,\" Yardeni said. \"But overall there's more going on in this economy than just Nvidia or artificial intelligence. The reality is that the economy proves to be remarkably resilient. It continues to grow at a good pace. Inflation's come down despite the fact that the unemployment rate remains below 4%.\n\"So it's been a great economy and the stock market reflects that. I don't think the AI story is the entire story here.\"\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page on Wednesday afternoon as shares tumbled more than 28% after the company's latest quarterly results were released on Tuesday afternoon. The cybersecurity company, whose stock had risen more than 100% over the past year, missed Wall Street's expectations for current year revenue guidance. Palo Alto guided for full-year revenue in a range of $7.95 billion to $8 billion, below analyst expectations for $8.18 billion.\nShares of fellow cybersecurity companies CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Zscaler (ZS) also sold off on the news, falling more than 10% after Palo Alto's report.\nMeanwhile, Teladoc Health (TDOC) shares fell more than 25% following the company's latest quarterly results release. Teladoc's earnings per share and revenue guidance for 2024 fell short of Wall Street's estimates as CEO Jason Gorevic described the telehealth market as \"fairly well-penetrated.\"\nThe minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting, released on Wednesday, showed officials remain cautious on cutting interest rates too soon.\n\"Most participants noted the risks of moving too quickly to ease the stance of policy,\" the minutes said.\nMeanwhile, only a \"couple\" officials highlighted the downside risks of holding policy in a restrictive stance.\nThe major stock averages ticked down slightly after the minutes reiterated many of the same talking points Fed officials have recently been touting, including that further confidence is needed that inflation will continue on its path downward.\nMarkets are continuing to price in the first interest rate cut in June. As of Wednesday afternoon, investor bets placed a 73% chance that the central bank cuts interest rates in June, per the CME FedWatch Tool. \nIt\u2019s a brutal day for Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and its cast of cybersecurity rivals.\nIn fact, there has been very little dip-buying in the stock judging by the action all day. The ticker has also remained tops on Yahoo Finance since this morning.\nShares of the cybersecurity play \u2014 and AI investor favorite \u2014 are selling off by close to 30% amid a shift in growth strategy towards free incentives that has sparked concern on the Street.\nBut, Advisors Capital Management Partner JoAnne Feeney\u00a0cautioned, the steep sell-off isn\u2019t a sign of weakening AI demand. And in fact, investors should use the dip in share price as an opportunity to \"get in.\"\nBold, and indeed contrarian on a day like this for Palo Alto.\n\u201cYou have a lot of short-term holders that recognize the next few months could be bumpy. ... There's questions about how much growth they can generate because of this shift in strategy,\u201d Feeney told me on Yahoo Finance Live. \u201cBut when you look into that shift, and what it portends for the future, it's a lot more potential to take market share.\u201d\nUltimately, the stock is on track for its biggest intraday drop on record. Rivals CrowdStrike (CRWD), Fortinet (FTNT), and Zscaler (ZS) also declined on the results as investors brace for Palo Alto-like warnings.\nMedia companies like Disney (DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) used to compete for subscribers to their streaming services. Now, they are looking to team up too.\nDisney's ESPN, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Fox (FOXA) announced they would launch a sports streaming service this upcoming fall. Meanwhile, Paramount (PARA) and Peacock owner Comcast (CMCSA) have held discussions about a potential joint streaming venture, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.\nThe developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), which are gobbling up streaming deals.\n\"Big Tech is now in this game,\" Jon Christian, executive vice president of digital media supply chain at entertainment consulting firm Qvest, told Yahoo Finance. \"These are highly diversified businesses that have a lot of money. It's a much different set of competitors for these legacy networks and studios.\"\nAs a result, consolidation through mergers and acquisitions or partnerships is the only way for these traditional players to compete, according to Christian.\n\"At the end of the day, you have to look at the consumer and ask, 'What is the least amount of friction for the end user to be able to view my content?'\" he said.\nThe concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services. The move toward partnerships among competing media companies, though, represents a clear strategy shift.\n\"It's more of an evolution as the industry matures, and the focus has become on maximizing profits,\" Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin told Yahoo Finance.\nRead more here. \nUgly.\nBrutal 32% sell-off in Roku (ROKU) over the past week (Nasdaq off by 2% roughly \u2026 before those Nvidia earnings) on fears Walmart\u2019s (WMT) Vizio (VZIO) deal will hammer Roku\u2019s account numbers and bottom line. Roku founder Anthony Wood \u2014 who owns 14% of the company \u2014 has seen his net worth tank about $400 million year to date.\nTough being a wealthy person, ain\u2019t it?\nThe question some on the Street are asking is what in the world do you do with Roku\u2019s damaged stock? Digging through equity research on the company, I don\u2019t think anyone has the answer yet!\nBut I believe JPMorgan analyst Cory Carpenter (who downgraded his rating \u2026 today) has a solid view on where things stand:\n\u201cThe Walmart & Vizio tie-up makes Vizio a stronger competitor, and we\u2019d expect Walmart to switch its house TV brand (onn.) from Roku\u2019s operating system to SmartCast. We believe onn. is likely one of Roku\u2019s bigger TV partners after TCL, and for reference Roku has 30+ TV partners globally. However, we\u2019d be surprised to see any material Roku active account impact until perhaps early 2025, with the VZIO acquisition not expected to close until 2Q, after which onn. TVs need to be integrated with VZIO\u2019s SmartCast operating system. We are less worried about Roku Device revenue impact, despite Walmart historically accounting for ~30% of Roku Device revenue (Amazon + Walmart = 59% of 2022 Device revenue; we assume a roughly equal split).\nWe expect Walmart to continue carrying Roku products, and while shelf space could be compromised, in our view other retailers (i.e., Target, Best Buy) are likely to be less keen to promote Walmart-owned Vizio TVs, potentially resulting in improved Roku shelf space at their locations. Said succinctly, we see minimal risk to our 2024 Roku estimates from the Walmart & Vizio tie-up, but we recognize the combination of Roku guiding to decelerating Platform growth and overhangs from Amazon Prime AVOD + Walmart/Vizio integration could limit share upside in the near-term. However, we remain bullish on the secular growth of connected TV and Roku\u2019s longer-term monetization opportunity as ad dollars increasingly shift from linear to streaming, and in our view Roku\u2019s recent pull-back presents a compelling entry point for longer-term investors.\u201d\nThe story in markets on Wednesday won't come until after the closing bell.\nNvidia, the leader of the AI hype cycle, is slated to report quarterly results after the market close and the company has sky-high expectations to meet.\nConsensus projects Nvidia to report earnings per share of $4.60 and revenue of about $20.4 billion. That would mark year-over-year growth of 422% and 236%, respectively.\nThose lofty projections come after Nvidia has consistently topped expectations by a wide margin since its blowout report last May. Nvidia's stock itself has run up more than 200% in the past year and the story behind it has sent the stock market into an AI-driven frenzy.\nThe company's influence has been wide ranging. Its investments in smaller AI plays have caught attention and recently sent shares of SoundHound (SOUN) up nearly 60% in a day. Its overall talk of AI demand has had investors betting on what could be the next AI winner and sent shares of company's like SuperMicro Computer (SMCI) and Palantir (PLTR) roaring.\nBut this could come at a cost, too, if the company fails to meet expectations. And that's what Wall Street will be watching for on Wednesday night.\nInteractive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills that the report could be \"very difficult\" for markets.\n\"If Nvidia misses or just fails to hit a home run ... that can have a gravitational effect on the whole market,\" Sosnick said.\nBig Food is itching to hit the reset button on its narrative with investors, who have soured on the group amid the spread of the Ozempic craze, and consumers balking at still inflationary prices.\nEnter CAGNY, more formally known as the annual Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference.\nThe event is well underway in Boca Raton, Fla., where major packaged food brands with juicy dividend payouts such as PepsiCo (PEP), Coca-Cola (KO), Hershey's (HSY), Conagra Brands (CAG), and Molson Coors (TAP), among others, are presenting.\nWhile the conference is set to run through Friday, I have spotted a few early themes from being here on the ground chatting up sources and sitting in on presentations:\nEyes on volume: As Americans pull back on just how much they're buying because of high prices (see chocolate), the volume recovery is in focus. Execs at both General Mills (GIS) and Conagra were \"hesitant to comment on whether fiscal 2025 (beginning in June) could be a return to growth in line with long-term targets,\" Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer wrote in a note to clients from the event.\nHershey and Mondel\u0113z (MDLZ) called on \"price pack architecture\" with different size and price point offerings, as another potential growth lever. \"We've always capitalized on having different price points, different pack sizes so that there's accessibility for everyone,\"Hershey CEO Michele Buck said.\nInnovation, as well as marketing with new partners, are other key tactics to re-engage consumers. Hershey's, for example, excited the crowd with NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal in attendance to announce a tie-up to \u201cwin\u201d in the gummy segment, the fastest-growing sweets segment. Conagra Brands shared that Dolly Parton's baking line is expanding into frozen shelves.\nThe Potential for deals: M&A chatter is alive and well, not too far removed from Campbell Soup's (CPB) big deal for pasta sauce maker Sovos Brands and J.M. Smucker (SJM) buying Twinkie king Hostess Brands.\nWhile no major announcements were made (yet), many companies are teasing that they're open to the idea of deals, but are waiting for the right company to come along at the right price.\nIt may not be a traditional acquisition one would think, though. Mizuho Securities managing director John Baumgartner told me that similar to Walmart's acquisition of Vizio this week, perhaps you could see \"food staples companies acquiring differentiated tech companies\" to gain a deeper understanding of consumers.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI^) just got more relevant.\nOn Tuesday night S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Amazon (AMZN) will replace Walgreens Boost Alliance (WBA) in the benchmark index. The change is set to go into effect before the market opens on Monday, Feb. 26.\n\"The index needs to stay relevant and reflect the higher end of US markets and Amazon was a natural selection at this point,\" Howard Silverblatt, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live.\nHe added: \"For the average investor it will mean that the index is more reflective of consumer selections at this point in time.\"\nThe swap of tech giant Amazon for Walgreens adds exposure to a variety of areas for the index. Amazon's wide range of industries including cloud computing, artificial intelligence exposure, healthcare, and e-commerce shopping for everyday products far exceeds the reach of the traditional pharmacy brand in Walgreens. This, Silverblatt said, was crucial in influencing the switch.\n\"[Amazon is] developing and giving you exposure to a few other fields where we would\u2019ve wanted to increase on it,\" Silverblatt said. \"But mostly you\u2019re dealing with the consumer, the retail sector, where the bulk of [Amazon] is right now. And that\u2019s a positive because the consumer is the biggest part of the economy.\"\nSilverblatt highlighted that unlike the S&P 500 which rebalances every quarter, the Dow Jones doesn't reshuffle the 30 companies within its index frequently. In the 120-year history of the Dow, there have only been 60 changes, per Silverblatt.\nBut one reason a company can be swapped out of the index is a deterioration in its stock price. Walgreens has seen that recently with shares down nearly 70% over the last five years, while Amazon is up more than 100% in that same time frame.\nUS stocks slipped on Wednesday as investors counted down to high-stakes earnings from AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) and the release of Federal Reserve minutes that could set hopes for interest rates.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped roughly 0.3%, while those on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, down 0.5% on the heels of Tuesday's declines.\nFrom inflation to the opposite of inflation.\nDeflation is starting to creep up into the conference calls and presentations of consumer companies. It\u2019s also starting to impact top-line sales trends as prices, well, deflate.\nWhere we have heard deflation used already this week:\nTuesday's Home Depot Earnings Call: Deflation was mentioned six times on the conference call.\nTuesday's Walmart Earnings Call: Deflation was mentioned two times on the conference call:\nThis is a topic I plan to dive into at 10:40 a.m. ET on Yahoo Finance Live in a chat with the CEO of Mondelez (MDLZ), Dirk Van de Put. The Oreo maker's sales outlook at the CAGNY conference (where Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has been stationed this week, firing off these interesting insights) yesterday suggests it's poised to overcome deflation in 2024, but more to come from our interview soon.\nIf you could only hear the chatter very early in the morning in the Yahoo Finance newsroom on one of the more favorite tickers on our platform, lightning-hot tech play Palo Alto Networks (PANW)...\nThe a.m. team seems to be of the view that Palo Alto Networks is unstoppable (which is probably in line with a lot of you who have traded this name in the past two years). I get it: The stock gained 377% in the past five years before the 22% premarket, post-earnings drubbing today. Palo Alto\u2019s meteoric stock price has been supported by strong rates of growth amid demand for cybersecurity products.\nBut I reminded the team that several things appeared to change fundamentally around Palo Alto Networks last night. And if you put them together, the steep sell-off looks warranted, and the stock may stay capped in the near term until investors get more comfortable.\nFor one, the company\u2019s billings outlook was 10% below consensus expectations. Palo Alto Networks said it\u2019s seeing some federal demand softness. I fancy there is more here, though \u2014 specifically around demand softness from big companies \u2014 akin to what we heard from Cisco (CSCO) last week (it\u2019s also in the cybersecurity business).\nAnd two, Palo Alto Networks surprised the Street via a new pricing strategy. It\u2019s one that could impact profit margins this year and perhaps into 2025.\nThe strategy shift reflects Palo Alto Networks more aggressively trying to gain market share by giving customers short-term access to solutions for \"free.\"\n\"This pricing/bundling/consolidation strategy can weigh on results over the next 12-18 months,\" warned Stifel analyst Adam Borg in a client note this morning.\nWelcome to the show-me story zone, PANW.\n"

Blockbuster earnings led to a share surge that values the company at $1.9 trillion, making it the third most valuable U.S. company ahead of Alphabet and Amazon. CEO Jensen Huang, who said Wednesday that generative AI is at a \"tipping point,\" is on the cusp of breaking into the world's top 20 richest people.\nYet in its bumper earnings report, Nvidia also warned that its business in China was dropping: The company's data center revenue out of China was at \"mid-single-digit percentage\" levels, coming down from as much as 25% in earlier quarters. U.S. export restrictions are making it difficult for Nvidia to ship products to China.\nAnd it appears that Chinese tech giant Huawei could be swooping in to fill the gap.\nThe U.S. chipmaker named Huawei as one of its competitors in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late on Wednesday. Huawei was the only Chinese company to be listed in several categories, including as a supplier of AI-related chips and as a provider of cloud computing for AI. It's the first time Nvidia has recognized Huawei as a competitor, according to Reuters.\nBaidu and Alibaba were the only other Chinese companies listed by Nvidia as competitors. The U.S. chipmaker also cited Samsung and Renesas Electronics, a Japanese semiconductor manufacturer, as competitors.\nHuawei's Ascend 910B chips are touted as a local alternative to Nvidia's processors, specifically those the U.S. chipmaker designed for the Chinese market to comply with Washington's restrictions.\nChinese companies like Huawei are pitching their products as a safer option if Washington tightens its export restrictions on semiconductors, Reuters reported in December. The Biden administration first imposed export restrictions on advanced chips in October 2022, tightening them again a year later.\nIn its filing, Nvidia said its competitive position \"has been harmed,\" and may be further harmed, by U.S. export controls. The company revealed that its supply chain is concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, including companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung, and Foxconn.\nBeing named as an Nvidia competitor is the latest stage in Huawei's comeback story. The firm, which at one point was battling for survival after being placed on a U.S. blacklist in 2019, recorded nearly $100 billion in revenue last year. That strong performance came after Huawei unveiled its Mate 60 Pro smartphone\u2014featuring a locally-made advanced semiconductor.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders in the U.S. equity options market are betting Nvidia's upcoming earnings report could spur a massive move in the shares of the world's most dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker.\nNvidia, up about 50% this year, could see its shares swing by about 11% in either direction following its quarterly results on Feb. 21, according to data from options analytics service ORATS. That's the largest expected move options traders have priced in ahead of Nvidia's earnings over the last three years and well above the stock's actual average earnings move of 6.7% over that period, ORATS founder Matt Amberson said.\nWith Nvidia's market capitalization at $1.8 trillion, a move of that size would make for a potential swing in market value of about $200 billion. That would be greater than the market capitalization of chipmaker Intel Corp and larger than the respective market values of about 90% of S&P 500 constituents.\nOn Thursday, more than 750,000 Nvidia options had changed hands by 1 p.m. (1800 GMT), making it the second most actively traded single stock name in the options market.\nDespite the sizeable run-up in the stock, demand for upside options bets on Nvidia remained intact, with one measure of sentiment - the stock's 90-day 25 delta call skew - near a five- year high, according to a Susquehanna analysis.\n\"The elevated call skew tells us that investors still see the potential for significant upside despite the move already made and that there is significant demand for upside exposure as some who may be fearful of the high volatility turn to upside calls for lower-risk exposure,\" Christopher Jacobson, a strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group, said.\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia overtook Google-parent Alphabet as the third most valuable U.S. company.\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $4.56 a share, and a rise in quarterly revenue to $20.378 billion from $6.05 billion a year ago, according to the mean estimate from 33 analysts, based on LSEG data.\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Leslie Adler)\n"

        "Title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock Now?",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has soared in recent times, climbing more than 200% over the past year, thanks to the company's crucial role in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). The tech giant's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the go-to chip for powering AI models.\nDemand in the world of AI may be just getting started. The market, at a compound annual growth rate of 36%, could reach more than $1.3 trillion by 2030, according to a Markets and Markets report. This means there should be plenty of business ahead for Nvidia.\nStill, considering the stock's enormous gain, you may be wondering if a lot of the good news is already priced in at today's level. Is it too late to get in on this AI giant?\nFirst, a bit of background on this top technology stock. Nvidia isn't only an AI stock. In fact, its first major success story happened in the world of gaming, where GPUs revolutionized the visuals and speed needed to make games come to life for users. GPUs break down one main problem into multiple tasks and process these tasks simultaneously, resulting in tremendous speed.\nAlready successful in gaming and graphics applications, the GPU's speed made it the perfect fit for many other uses, especially AI. In 2007, Nvidia launched CUDA, a parallel computing platform that lets coders apply GPUs to AI and general purposes. Since then, the company's GPUs have become a key tool in the \"deep learning\" of AI models because the operation involves the processing of massive quantities of data.\nToday, Nvidia holds more than 80% of the AI chip market, but others aim to challenge this leadership. For example, in December, Advanced Micro Devices launched a new chip series -- the MI300X -- to compete with Nvidia's star H100. Though the new product looks promising, Nvidia says its H100 still remains twice as fast.\nIt may not be too difficult for Nvidia to maintain its lead because the company has progressively increased its research and development (R&D) spending. In the most recent quarter, R&D expenses increased 18% to $2.2 billion. So, yes, rivals are working on increased performance, but so is Nvidia -- and it has the advantage of already being the fastest kid on the block.\nNvidia can afford to make these investments because the company's earnings have skyrocketed -- thanks to its data centers business, which includes AI. In the most recent quarter, revenue rose more than 200% to a record of more than $18 billion. Data centers accounted for $14 billion of that. And net income advanced more than 1,000% to $9.2 billion on a GAAP basis.\nThe company also is reporting high levels of free cash flow, and its return on invested capital shows it's been benefiting from its investment decisions.\nAll of this means Nvidia has what it takes to ensure its leadership position from a technological and financial point of view. This is extremely important, considering that so much of its business now is linked to use outside of the gaming industry.\nNow let's get back to our question: Is it too late to get in on this top-performing stock? After all, the future looks bright, but the stock has climbed in the triple digits in a short period.\nA look at the company's valuation shows that, even after such a gain, it trades for only 33x forward earnings estimates, a dirt cheap level for a profitable company growing revenue in the triple digits.\nConsidering the growth forecasts for the AI market, there's reason to believe Nvidia could keep the momentum going for quite some time -- if it can remain a step ahead of its rivals. That's why it's not too late to buy shares of this top AI stock today because its story in the industry may just be getting started.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Better AI Stock: Nvidia vs. Palantir",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) investing world is quite large. There are multiple ways to invest in the trend, from hardware to software to application plays. Each of these segments has advantages and drawbacks. Still, two of the most popular ways to invest in AI from the hardware and software perspective are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE: PLTR), respectively.\nBut of these two, which is the better buy? Let's find out.\nNvidia's GPUs (graphics processing units) are the building blocks of AI computing. GPUs are great at processing complex computing loads like training an AI model. With Nvidia's GPUs often perceived as best-in-class, it has become the go-to company for GPUs slated for AI use.\nPalantir's software was originally designed for the government to take in loads of data and deliver actionable insights. Its software has since expanded to commercial use, although government revenue still makes up most of its business. Palantir's software is highly adaptable and can be tailored to meet a variety of needs, whether it's a hospital, insurance, or manufacturing company.\nThe two markets these two serve are completely different, as are the rest of their attributes.\nBecause Nvidia is a hardware company, its revenue stream isn't recurring. It needs to sell additional GPUs to grow its business, and if the demand isn't there, then Nvidia's revenue could suffer.\nPalantir's software model requires its customers to renew within a predetermined time frame (often annual or monthly), and clients must pay a fee to continue using Palantir's product.\nSo, if a recession strikes, Nvidia's revenue streams will likely come under pressure as customers may choose to delay some of its projects. Conversely, if Palantir's software is highly integrated into a client's systems, they likely have no choice but to continue paying Palantir.\nWinner: Palantir\nWhen considering outright growth, Nvidia is far superior to Palantir. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Oct. 30), Nvidia's revenue rose 206% year over year compared to Palantir's fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 (ended Dec. 31) growth of 20%.\nWhile Nvidia's growth far outpaces Palalntir's, Palantir is still growing at a respectable rate for a software company.\nWinner: Nvidia \nUnlike many growth companies, Palantir knows how to turn a profit. In Q4, it posted a 15% profit margin.\nPalantir's profit margins have steadily risen over the past few years, and it isn't done yet. However, Nvidia's profit margins are far superior to Palantir's since it is a mature business.\nIf Nvidia goes through another downturn due to demand depletion, don't be surprised if Nvidia's margins drop below Palantir's. But for right now, Nvidia is far ahead of Palantir in this measure.\nWinner: Nvidia\nBecause Palantir hasn't reached maximum profitability, using a valuation measure like a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is problematic, so a revenue-based measure like the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is often used. Likewise, a mature company like Nvidia shouldn't be using the P/S ratio; instead, it should use the P/E ratio.\nAs a result, comparing these two head-to-head is difficult. So, we'll have to compare them to their peers.\nAt 25 times sales, Palantir is a very expensive stock. But it's not in unprecedented territory. Peers like CrowdStrike, Snowflake, and Cloudflare all trade in this range, but their revenue growth rates are in the 30% year-over-year range instead of 20% for Palantir. As a result, Palantir can be considered as an incredibly expensive stock.\nNvidia's price-to-earnings ratio hasn't improved, as it trades for nearly 100 times earnings. But when forward earnings are utilized (which factor in the next 12 months of growth), Nvidia's stock doesn't look as expensive, as it trades for 35 times forward earnings. With peers like Microsoft and Apple trading at 35 and 28 times forward earnings, Nvidia's price tag doesn't look as bad, especially when its warp-speed growth rate is considered.\nWith Nvidia being more closely valued by its peers than Palantir, it wins this round.\nWinner: Nvidia\nAt a final score of three to one, Nvidia beats out Palantir. But, the one category Palantir did win (revenue type) could cause it to become a better stock in all four areas if Nvidia hits a demand slump.\nBut as of right now, Nvidia looks like the better buy.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Lewis Krauskopf ",
        "Text": "By Lewis Krauskopf\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Money managers are scrambling to cash in on the stock market\u2019s interest in artificial intelligence, as a stunning rally by Nvidia sparks a search for other companies that are capitalizing on the technology.\nShares of Nvidia - whose chips are the gold standard in the AI industry - are up about 60% this year after tripling in 2023. The run has pushed its market value to roughly $2 trillion, making it the third-largest U.S. company by market cap after Microsoft and Apple.\nIt has also spurred Wall Street to search for other AI-focused companies in hopes of catching outsized moves. Whether investors are looking at the broader chip industry or betting on firms elsewhere in the value chain, they agree on one thing: AI is here to stay.\n\u201cIt's not a fad,\" said Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager for F/m Investments' Large Cap Focused Fund. \"There are too many ... cases where companies can make really good use of the technology to enhance both their top and bottom lines.\u201d\nExcitement over AI helped power the Nasdaq Composite Index to a record high on Thursday, while the S&P 500 also marked its latest record. The indexes are both up about 7% this year.\nFurther signs of the growing fixation on AI have been easy to spot. Mentions of AI on conference calls reached a new high in the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs said recently. The bank\u2019s analysts have estimated artificial intelligence technology could add 1.5 percentage points to U.S. productivity growth if there is widespread adoption over the next decade.\nA Morgan Stanley survey of chief information officers suggests 2024 is \"a Year of Investment for AI,\" the bank said in a note this week, with CIOs naming AI/machine learning as their top priority for the first time.\nBido\u2019s fund retains a large holding in Nvidia, but has branched out into other AI plays, including rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices and MongoDB, whose database products could be in high demand as AI is poised to change data infrastructure needs.\nThose stocks have risen sharply, although less dramatically, than Nvidia and some other AI plays that have recently captured the market's attention. AMD shares are up 30% year-to-date, for example, while Mongo\u2019s have risen 9%, though the shares of both companies doubled last year.\nBy contrast, shares of server component supplier Super Micro Computer and chip designer ARM Holding have jumped about 200% and 90%, respectively, in 2024. SMCI's shares tripled in 2023.\nIvana Delevska, founder and chief investment officer of Spear Invest, said Nvidia has remained the biggest holding in its Spear Alpha ETF. But the exchange-traded fund has also sought to capitalize on growing cybersecurity needs related to AI by owning shares of Zscaler, a cybersecurity specialist. The fund's position in Snowflake, meanwhile, seeks to take advantage of data infrastructure demands.\nOf course, the risks of playing the often-volatile stocks of AI-related companies remain despite the technology\u2019s higher profile. Shares of Snowflake, for example, fell 18% on Thursday after the company projected annual revenue below Wall Street estimates and disclosed the unexpected retirement its CEO.\nBaker Avenue Wealth Management trimmed its Nvidia holding as the stock has climbed so that it does not occupy too large a position in client portfolios, said King Lip, the firm\u2019s chief strategist.\nBut the firm recently started building a position in Taiwan Semiconductor, a key supplier to Nvidia.\n\"If you still want artificial intelligence exposure but are perhaps a little skittish about Nvidia\u2019s stock price, I think Taiwan Semi is kind of a no brainer,\u201d Lip said.\nQue Nguyen, chief investment officer of equities at Research Affiliates, is looking for reasonably valued semiconductor companies that could stand to benefit from AI. Among them are Lam Research Corp, which supplies equipment to the semiconductor industry, and Micron Technology, which makes memory chips and data storage.\nLam Research shares are up about 20% so far this year, while Micron is up 6%.\n\u201cLarge language models are not just processing, you need to have storage,\u201d Nguyen said.\nOf course, many investors are happy sticking with big Nvidia positions.\nThe Martin Currie US Unconstrained Fund has nearly 10% of its assets - the maximum the fund allows for one stock - in Nvidia, said portfolio manager Zehrid Osmani. He believes the company will maintain competitive advantages as it spends more heavily than rivals on research and development.\n\"We have high conviction in the name, and that's expressed through high position size,\" Osmani said.\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Additional reporting by David Randall in New York; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAs of 2024-02-19, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $253.44. It's currently trading at a price of $726.03. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -186.47%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$8.11\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.28%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 34.30% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n267.5\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n387.73\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n253.44\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $219.50. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -230.77%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "By David French\n(Reuters) -The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both surged to record closing highs on Thursday, powered by investors piling into growth and technology stocks the day after artificial intelligence poster child Nvidia's bumper earnings and outlook.\nFor the S&P 500 benchmark, it was also the largest daily gain in 13 months. The Nasdaq Composite notched its biggest single-session advance in a year and just missed a record finish.\nInvestors eagerly bought stocks as Nvidia shares jumped 16.4% after the chip designer forecast a roughly three-fold surge in first-quarter revenue on strong demand for its AI chips and beat expectations for fourth-quarter revenue.\nThe company's earnings were a major test for the AI-fueled rally on Wall Street that first pushed the S&P 500 above the 5,000 point mark earlier this month. Some analysts had cautioned that disappointing results could spark a steep selloff among technology stocks.\nInstead, the S&P 500 ended at a record high, gaining 105.23 points, or 2.11%, to 5,087.03, as did the Dow Jones Industrials, which closed at 39,069.11 after rising 456.87 points, or 1.18%. It was the first time the Dow has ever finished above 39,000 points.\nThe Nasdaq Composite added 460.75 points, or 2.96%, to 16,041.62.\n\"As Nvidia goes, so goes the world,\" joked Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.\nHe noted how Nvidia's earnings performance trounced high market expectations, showing doubters that plenty of juice was left in the AI trade after the recent rally.\n\"When do you sell - maybe you don't. Maybe there's still room, and I'm happy to sit and ride it out,\" Janasiewicz added.\nNvidia added $277 billion to its market capitalization, beating Meta Platform's $196 billion surge earlier this month as the biggest one-day gain by any company in Wall Street history.\nThose shorting Nvidia stock were left nursing more than $2.9 billion of paper losses, per data from Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.\nThe benchmark index will finish this year above the 5,000 mark, according to strategists in a Reuters poll.\nAll but one of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, with technology stocks leading gains with a 4.4% increase. The outlier was utilities, which slipped 0.8%\nThe S&P 500 growth index advanced 3.3%, its biggest daily percentage gain since November 2022.\nShares of other companies, seen as beneficiaries of the AI boost, also got a shot in the arm. Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices, server component supplier Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings jumped between 4.2% and 32.9%.\nSynopsys soared 6.9%, to a record finish, after the software maker for chip designers reported estimate-beating earnings and outlook.\nAlso posting a record close was the Philadelphia Semiconductor index, with its 5% increase its largest one-day gain since October.\nBig Tech and growth stocks such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta Platforms climbed between 1.1% and 3.9%.\nElsewhere, vaccine maker Moderna jumped 13.5% after surprising investors with a fourth-quarter profit. The stock's technicals also pointed to a bullish outlook.\nHowever, Rivian and Lucid tumbled 25.6% and 16.8%, respectively, after the electric vehicle startups forecast 2024 production well below analyst estimates on slowdown in demand.\nThe volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.93 billion shares, compared with the 11.64 billion average over the last 20 trading days.\n(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Bansari Mayur Kamdar in Bengaluru and David French in New York; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta, Shinjini Ganguli and David Gregorio)\n"

        "Author": "  Noel Randewich ",
        "Text": "By Noel Randewich\n(Reuters) -Chipmaker Nvidia is replacing Tesla as Wall Street's most traded stock by value, adding to its prominence after becoming the third-most valuable U.S. company and showing more evidence of how central AI-related bets have become to investors.\nNvidia's outsized representation in day-to-day stock trading could leave investors more vulnerable should the chipmaker's revenue growth fail to meet investors' high expectations and puncture a Wall Street rally that has been fueled by euphoria about artificial intelligence.\nThe Santa Clara, California chipmaker's quarterly report late on Wednesday will be one of Wall Street's most watched events of the week. Some strategists believe anything short of a blowout report could reverse a rally that has sent Nvidia's stock soaring 40% in 2024.\nNvidia's stock dropped about 5% on Tuesday, reflecting investors' jitters ahead of the report.\nAbout $30 billion worth of Nvidia shares changed hands daily on average over the past 30 sessions, pulling ahead of Elon Musk's electric car maker, which averaged $22 billion per day over the same period.\nTesla since 2020 had dominated daily U.S. stock trading, according to LSEG data, with turnover -- a stock's share price multiplied by the number of shares exchanged -- peaking above $35 billion several times in recent years.\nOn Tuesday, combined trading in Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, another company benefiting from the boom in AI, accounted for 46% of all turnover of the 10 most traded U.S. stocks, including Tesla, Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.\n\"There's an argument here that this is the dawn of a new era of trading, like the dawn of the internet, with Nvidia in the pole position,\" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading in Ontario, Canada.\nBut Dick also warned that sky-high turnover in AI-related stocks suggests retail investors and algorithmic traders are driving share prices higher based on momentum rather than fundamentals, such as expectations of future revenue growth.\nSuper Micro, which sells AI-related server components to Nvidia, has seen its value nearly triple to $43 billion so far in 2024. It fell about 5% on Tuesday following a 20% collapse from record highs on Friday after Wells Fargo started covering the stock with an equal weight rating, saying its valuation already discounts \"solid upside\".\nNvidia controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, and last week its market capitalization eclipsed, separately, Amazon's and Alphabet's to make it Wall Street's third-most valuable company, behind Microsoft and Apple.\nFollowing Tuesday's selloff in Nvidia shares, Alphabet and Amazon's stock market values both pulled back ahead of the chipmaker. Nvidia's stock market value last stood at $1.7 trillion, compared to $540 billion a year ago.\nMeanwhile, Tesla's stock has tumbled 23% so far in 2024 as it struggles with tepid demand for its electric cars and growing competition.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Rosalba O'Brien)\n"

        "Text": "Newly-tailored chips for China from Nvidia are set for direct competition with a processor developed by domestic giant Huawei Technologies, with the two products having a similar price and performance, according to industry sources.\nNvidia has started to take pre-orders for its H20, a powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) that the US chip design firm can supply to China-based customers for artificial intelligence (AI) training, with a single card price range between US$12,000 and US$15,000, according to industry sources, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\nThe computing capabilities of the H20 are similar to Ascend 910B, an AI chip developed by Huawei, the Shenzhen-based firm under US trade sanctions, separate sources said, adding that the price would also be similar.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nA high-end server, embedded with eight Nvidia H20 cards, is priced at about 1.4 million yuan (US$195,800), according to one source with direct knowledge of the matter.\nNvidia declined to comment on Friday, while Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Ascend 910B chip is available through various sales channels in China, although the company has never officially confirmed the product's existence, sources said. A distributor from the eastern province of Shandong said on Thursday that a Huawei server embedded with 910B chips sells for around 1.36 million yuan as of January this year.\nUS trade sanctions prevent Nvidia from exporting to China its advanced GPUs, such as the A100 and H100, which have become sought-after components for AI training. Its tailor-made A800 and H800 GPUs, developed as workarounds for Chinese clients, were blocked by updated US controls last October, resulting in new alternatives such as the H20.\nNvidia's authorised distributors have started to discuss shipments of the H20 with Chinese clients, and some are expected to start testing the chip soon, according to three people familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified as they are not authorised to talk to the media.\nOne source, which has placed H20 orders with Nvidia, said they expect the first volume shipment to arrive in China in the second quarter. Another source with a major Chinese internet gear and server maker, said they expected to start shipments of their products containing the H20 in July.\nA third source said that a small number of Chinese clients had already received H20 samples for testing purposes.\nNvidia graphics cards are in hot demand from global tech firms and cloud services providers, with Chinese Big Tech companies spending billions of dollars to amass supplies of the GPUs to help power the new era of generative AI technologies kick-started by OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nNvidia saw its data centre segment exceed video gaming for the first time to become the top revenue contributor in its 2023 financial year. In the third quarter ending October 31, Nvidia's data centre revenue jumped 279 per cent year on year to reach a record US$14.51 billion.\nIt is not yet clear how the H20 will be received by Chinese clients, as the chip's capabilities have been constrained to meet the new US rules.\nTwo of the sources the Post spoke to said that the H20's capabilities fall behind its predecessors - the A800 and A100 - by a large margin although the source from the server maker said the situation was still unclear as full, in-house testing is not complete.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) closed the latest trading day at $722.48, indicating a +0.16% change from the previous session's end. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.1%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.33%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.3%.\nShares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have appreciated by 31.85% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 11.35% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.78%.\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Nvidia in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on February 21, 2024. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $4.51, signifying a 412.5% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $20.18 billion, reflecting a 233.52% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Nvidia. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 1.04% increase. At present, Nvidia boasts a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nLooking at valuation, Nvidia is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 35.62. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 26.52, so one might conclude that Nvidia is trading at a premium comparatively.\nOne should further note that NVDA currently holds a PEG ratio of 2.64. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - General industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.72 as of yesterday's close.\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

        "Title": "Could Nvidia Stock Help You Retire a Millionaire?",
        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Up a whopping 1,720% over the past five years, semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has produced life-changing returns for investors. But it's not a new act. The stock is up an even more impressive 87,000% over its lifetime.\nA true millionaire maker.\nToday, at a humungous $1.5 trillion market cap, it probably won't continue multiplying in size. After all, America's entire annual economic output is worth $28 trillion. But that doesn't mean Nvidia still can't help you retire a millionaire.\nInvestors can confidently buy and hold Nvidia in a diversified portfolio and enjoy the compounding returns that are likely on the way.\nI'll discuss how Nvidia can still change your financial fortunes below.\nNvidia built a tremendous company by specializing in dedicated graphics processing units (GPUs). These are computer chips designed for intense workloads like high-end gaming. As technology advanced over time and demanded higher-performing hardware, Nvidia's chips began spreading to new end markets like cryptocurrency mining, autonomous driving, and, yes, artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe company has become the dominant AI chip supplier in short order. Nvidia built a software ecosystem that made it easy for customers to implement and develop AI models on Nvidia chips. Today, Nvidia has an estimated 90% market share, and it's believed the AI chip market could grow to sizes ranging from $120 billion to $400 billion by 2027 (and could keep growing beyond that).\nRegardless of where the numbers ultimately land, AI is clearly a tremendous opportunity. As the dominant chip company, Nvidia could technically capture much of that growth, but investors may want to pump the brakes. There is no doubt Nvidia will remain a significant factor in AI, but competition will aggressively chase it. Additionally, some more prominent AI chip users could design in-house hardware; some are already working on it.\nThe bottom line is that Nvidia will continue growing, but it's unlikely that Nvidia will maintain its recent pace.\nThe good news is that's OK. Nvidia doesn't need to become some $10 trillion company to make you extremely wealthy over the long term. It's just going to happen differently than investors are used to. You see, Nvidia is already highly profitable, and its tremendous revenue growth is making it a cash cow.\nNvidia has converted 39% of its revenue to free cash flow over the past four quarters, totaling $17.5 billion. Analysts currently estimate $109 billion for the fiscal year ending January 2026. Cash flow margins could improve as Nvidia grows, but that's still about $40 billion in cash flow even if they don't.\nWhere am I going with this? There's a good chance that Nvidia's massive cash flow and what it does with that money will drive investment returns over the next decade and beyond. Shareholders could see Nvidia's profits trickle down to them as dividends and share repurchases. The company already pays a dividend, though its yield is hilariously low at 0.03% because of how much shares have risen.\nShareholders will be too giddy to laugh if management raises the dividend faster. The dividend only costs Nvidia about $394 million, a rounding error to the company today. I'm more optimistic that Nvidia will turn into a cannibal, repurchasing staggeringly large amounts of stock to boost its earnings-per-share (EPS) as revenue growth eventually slows.\nYou can see that management recently began pressing this button, so investors could be at the beginning of a long stretch where repurchases lower the share count, making yours worth more.\nNvidia is too big to be the lottery ticket it once was. But is Nvidia capable of helping you retire a millionaire? Absolutely.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "Is Nvidia (NVDA) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.20 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 40 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.5% and 5% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>The ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nShould You Invest in NVDA?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 17.8% over the past month to $23.22.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nvidia.

        "Title": "As Nvidia\u2019s stock price soars above $788, market sage Rob Arnott has a warning for investors: \u2018Disruptors are often disrupted\u2019",
        "Author": "  Shawn Tully ",
        "Text": "For the worlds of finance and tech, Nvidia is now widely viewed an historic pioneer whose time has come, a colossus bound to dominate the artificial intelligence revolution en route to lifting the productivity and profitability of businesses worldwide to new heights. That's the message underscored by the astounding liftoff that on February 22, following its big-time earnings beat, boosted its market cap in a single day by 16% or $270 billion, and by mid-morning on February 23, added another 2% to hike its valuation to over $2 trillion.\nAmidst the widespread drumbeat of praise, skeptical voices are few. But we've heard many times before that the first mover in a change-the-world thrust forward will maintain its top position far into the future, only to witness the shooting stars get smothered by disruptors lured by the leader's rich profitability, and the industry's immense promise. So to get a perspective on the likelihood that Nvidia likely faces that fate, I asked two veterans who've seen super-hot innovators rise and fall to provide their take to Fortune.\nI put the question first to an expert who spans the worlds of academic finance and capital markets. Rob Arnott is founder and chairman of Research Affiliates, a firm that oversees investment strategies for $139 billion in mutual funds and ETFs. Arnott, alongside RA's CEO Chris Brightman, personally manages Pimco's $13 billion All Asset Fund. He's the father of \"fundamental indexing,\" an approach that weights companies in a portfolio by sales, net worth and other metrics measuring their size in the economy rather than by market cap, so that investors aren't trapped into putting more and more of their savings into the most expensive stocks. Arnott, who also served as editor-in-chief of the Financial Analysts Journal, oversees a group of PhDs at RA who conduct groundbreaking research, and consults regularly with the top minds at universities and business schools on ideas to refine RA's playbook.\nIn an email to Fortune, Arnott notes that the notion underpinning Nvidia's rise, that a single or even a couple of trailblazers that initially rule a new technology will maintain overwhelming leadership and deserve epic valuations, is another in a long series of \"big market delusions.\" He says that today's situation mirrors the early days in everything from hand-held devices to personal computers to eCommerce to laying pipes for The Internet. The AI frenzy, he declares, recalls such crazes as \"the dot.com bubble in 1999 and EVs in 2021.\"\nFor Arnott, when apparent breakthroughs first appeared and attracted strong investor backing you could usually count on three things: \"First, an exciting new industry is taking shape. Second, it will show impressive growth in the years ahead and probably change the world. Third, at the start, there's a handful of companies dominating this exciting new landscape.\"\nSo in most cases, the promise eventually paid off. But that doesn't mean those who led the way greatly profited over the years ahead. \"It was usually not true that first, the new technology brought on change nearly as rapid as the markets predicted,\" he says. \"And second, it was often not true that these will be the dominant players 5 or 10 or even 20 years in the future.\" Most of all, he adds, it's wrong to think that \"We can pay any price because these companies can achieve stupendous profits in due course. That's usually not true.\"\nArnott describes the herd mentality that's so swelled Nvidia's stock price as \"the classic nature of bubbles. Disruptors change the world in wonderful ways, but they cannot succeed unless their customers are succeeding even more than they are, and disruptors are often themselves disrupted.\" He points to Palm, dominant in handheld technology in 2000 losing out to BlackBerry in 2003, then BlackBerry losing to Apple's iPhone in 2008. Arnott's point is that competition eventually drives down a new industry's initially sterling profitability. The biggest beneficiaries are the customers that bank big productivity gains from advances in software or online advertising algorithms, and the sectors' enduring champs are the players that keep innovating so that their products help customers work faster, better and cheaper.\nArnott agrees that fast-growers such as Nvidia deserve \"premium valuations.\" But he argues that Nvidia's market cap is far, far too high versus the dollars it now generates in earnings. In his view, the risk Nvidia will follow so many others that have fallen from glory is much too great to justify its current PE (now at nearly 70). \"Nvidia's priced for perfection,\" he says. \"Its valuation leaves no room for shocks. Never short-sell bubble stocks when they're on a roll. But you don't have to own them, either.\"\nJack Ciesielski, former author of the Analyst's Accounting Observer, has long been one of the most astute commentators on trends in the financial markets. And he agrees with Arnott that the same forces that hammered the early winners in other great leaps forward could well stymie Nvidia. \"Remember what happened in word processing and early PCs,\" he says. \"First, you had the likes of WordPerfect, Ami Pro and Lotus, along with Commodore, Radio Shack and Eagle. But they lost, and the prizes went to Apple and Microsoft. It was the same in the early days of the internet. The companies that laid the cable such as UUNET and Lucent got big valuations, and are no longer with us. But those that thrived turned out to be the Amazons, Googles and companies that used the pipes.\"\nCiesielski observes that, \"It's not the first movers who usually win, it's the second movers\" who follow on with better strategies for winning customers and hatching the best new products. Plus, Nvidia is far from alone right now in minting AI software. Today, AMD and Intel are rolling out their own AI chips. As Arnott and Ciesielski both note, Nvidia's created a rage that all the software giants want ardently to join. Its takeoff is luring a herd of competitors set on winning their places as the princes or kings of AI. By attracting an onslaught, Nvidia's sorcerous success may be planting the seeds of its decline.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

The Rank was signaling something was going on in the datacenter and chip industries as the Rank moved to the highest level, the Strong Buy, last year and has mostly stayed at that level.\nCurrently, NVIDIA, Super Micro Computer and Vertiv, all three involved in AI and datacenters, remain Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks after their recent earnings reports.\nWere you noticing the Rank on these stocks? It was signaling something \u201cgood\u201d was going on at these companies.\nWhat is the Zacks Rank?\nThe Zacks Rank is Zacks stock ranking system which ranks stocks into 5 categories with Strong Buys being the top category, and Strong Sells the bottom category. However, most stocks will be ranked in the middle, as Holds.\nZacks ranks over 4400 stocks. The top ranked stocks are rare. There are currently just 244 Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) stocks.\nThe Zacks Rank is based on analyst earnings estimate revisions and can change daily. It is just a 1 to 3-month recommendation.\nHow to Get a Strong Buy Rank\nIn order to get the #1 Strong Buy rank, the analysts have to be in agreement and raising earnings estimates.\nWhen a company reports earnings, beats, and then raises guidance, that\u2019s the perfect conditions for the company to achieve the top rank. After a beat and raise, the analysts usually end up revising their own estimates higher.\nMany AI and datacenter companies have been beating, and raising, for several quarters. The Zacks Rank has been signaling for months that something \u201cgood\u201d was going on.\nHow the Zacks Rank Got it Right on NVIDIA and other Datacenter Stocks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\nNVIDIA first became a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the second quarter of 2023, after it reported earnings and beat and raised.\nNVIDIA actually fell to a #2 (Buy) late in 2023 but it jumped back up to a #1 (Strong Buy) again in 2024 after the recent earnings beat and raise. Shares of NVIDIA are up 73% since May 30, 2023, which is a few days after earnings to the present.\nNVIDIA analysts are still raising estimates. Fourteen earnings estimates are higher for fiscal 2025 in the last week and none have been cut.\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about NVIDIA?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI)\nSuper Micro Computer was a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as early as the fourth quarter of 2021. It also fell to a #2 (Buy) during that period before busting out to #1 (Strong Buy) rank again in the third quarter of 2023, after earnings.\nZacks only has 3 analyst estimates on Super Micro Computer for the full year, as it\u2019s not as highly followed on the Street as NVIDIA.\nBut those analysts are still bullish. 2 estimates have been revised higher on Super Micro Computer in the last month for both Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2025.\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about Super Micro Computer?\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vertiv Holdings Co. (VRT)\nVertiv, like NVIDIA, has been beating and raising every quarter for the last year. Vertiv became a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the same time as NVIDIA, in the second quarter of 2023. It has briefly fallen to a #2 (Buy) stock but has now reclaimed the Strong Buy rank.\nAnalysts are bullish on Vertiv as well. 2 earnings estimates have been revised higher in the last week for both 2024 and 2025. Even though it\u2019s a large cap company, Zacks has just 3 estimates on the company for both years. It is not heavily covered on the Street.\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about Vertiv?\nWhat\u2019s Does the Zacks Rank Signal About Mega Cap AI?\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)\nAlphabet has not been a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) since the fourth quarter of 2021. It was briefly a #2 (Buy) in the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\nAlphabet is currently a Zacks #3 (Hold), which is where most stocks end up. The analysts are mixed on Alphabet for 2024. 10 estimates were raised for the full year in the last 30 days, but 7 were also cut during that time.\nIs the stock reflecting the uncertainty in Alphabet\u2019s earnings outlook?\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t been a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) since the first quarter of 2020. It has, however, recently been a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock. It was a Buy stock in the fourth quarter of 2023 and again in the first quarter of 2024. It remains a #2 (Buy) stock.\nAnalysts are bullish on Microsoft for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. 17 earnings estimates are higher for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 in the last 30 days, with no analyst estimate cuts.\nWith all that bullishness, why isn\u2019t Microsoft a #1 (Strong Buy) instead of a #2?\nWhat Else do you Need to Know About Using the Zacks Rank? \u00a0\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of VRT, MSFT and GOOGL in her own personal portfolio.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Microsoft is developing a new network card that could improve the performance of its Maia AI server chip and potentially reduce the company's reliance on chip designer Nvidia, The Information reported on Tuesday.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has tapped Pradeep Sindhu, who co-founded networking gear developer Juniper Networks, to spearhead the network card effort, the report said citing a person with knowledge of the matter. Microsoft acquired Sindhu's server chip startup, Fungible, last year.\nThe new network card is similar to Nvidia's ConnectX-7 card, which the chip developer sells alongside its graphic processor units (GPUs), the report added.\nThe equipment could take more than a year to develop and, if successful, could lessen the time it takes for OpenAI to train its models on Microsoft servers as well as make the process less expensive, according to the report.\nMicrosoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nMicrosoft has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and has incorporated its technology in a wide variety of products, giving the Windows-maker a leg up in the race to sell artificial-intelligence software.\nThe company had introduced Maia, a chip meant to run large language models and support AI computing, in November.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)\n"

And I think that's a mistake.\"\nFollowing a new round of U.S. restrictions in October imposed on some of its AI chips, Nvidia said in November it was working with customers in China and the Middle East to obtain export licenses for new products that would comply with U.S. rules.\nThe CEO did not address that issue on Monday.\nNvidia is due to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 21.\n(Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Christopher Cushing & Shri Navaratnam)\n"

        "Title": "Up 63% in 2024, Where Will Nvidia's Soaring Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "With shares up a whopping 63% year to date, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is still riding high on the artificial intelligence (AI) wave that boosted its shares by almost 240% in the last 12 months alone. \nStellar fourth-quarter results confirm that the company still enjoys significant near-term momentum. But what could the next five years have in store? Let's explore how new business verticals and valuation concerns could shape this iconic chipmaker's long-term trajectory. \nNvidia's earnings have become big events for tech investors. Because of the chipmaker's outsized role in the burgeoning AI industry, its operational results can give valuable clues about the state of the sector as a whole. This time, the company didn't disappoint. \nFourth-quarter revenue jumped 265% year over year to $22.1 billion (up 22% sequentially) based on sales of its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs) for training and running AI applications. \nPerhaps most importantly, Nvidia's gross margin of 76% (up 12% year over year) remains spectacularly high for a hardware company. The margins suggest the chipmaker still enjoys significant pricing power despite rising competition from rivals like Advanced Micro Devices, which recently entered the market with its new MI300 family of AI chips. \nThe AI chip industry may still be in its early stages, with some experts expecting it to be worth $400 billion by 2027. That said, Nvidia may need to diversify its strategy in this market. Over time, some of its largest data center customers may invest more in making proprietary chips instead of relying on its expensive third-party supplies. Management is taking several steps to get ahead of this potential challenge. \nIn February, Nvidia announced a $30 billion investment into a new business unit focused on helping cloud computing clients make customized chips. This move could help Nvidia leverage its economies of scale to tackle the market for niche use cases that aren't well served by its general-purpose chips like the H100 and A100. \nNvidia is also betting on the software through its supercomputer DGX Cloud, designed to help clients create and run AI applications without going through the trouble of building their own infrastructure. Together, these diversification efforts can help the company maintain its extremely high growth rate in the face of rising competition. \nNvidia is arguably one of the most compelling companies in the world from an investor standpoint. It has a rock-solid economic moat in a high-margin opportunity. And it is future-proofing its business by expanding into synergistic opportunities in custom chips and software. Most surprisingly, shares still trade at a reasonable valuation of just 33 times forward earnings -- slightly higher than the S&P 500 average of 28. \nNvidia's only serious risk seems to be if the AI industry fails to meet its lofty expectations. But there are no signs of that happening yet. Investors who purchased shares near the lows in 2023 may want to take some profits off the table. But the stock still looks like a long-term buy. \nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) closed the latest trading day at $682.23, indicating a -1.6% change from the previous session's end. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.23% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.37%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.07%.\nThe maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence's shares have seen an increase of 32.69% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 11.06% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.3%.\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Nvidia in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on February 21, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $4.49, indicating a 410.23% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $20.1 billion, up 232.16% from the year-ago period.\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Nvidia. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Nvidia is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nWith respect to valuation, Nvidia is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 34.55. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 25.15 for its industry.\nAlso, we should mention that NVDA has a PEG ratio of 2.56. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Semiconductor - General stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.64 based on yesterday's closing prices.\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 235, finds itself in the bottom 7% echelons of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

        "Author": "  Derek Lewis ",
        "Text": "Earnings season continues to wind down, with the majority of S&P 500 companies already delivering quarterly results. The period has been primarily positive, with results from the Technology sector keeping market sentiment in check.\nConversely, Energy results have weighed on the overall earnings picture. Nonetheless, one of the most highly-awaited quarterly releases was delivered yesterday after the bell \u2013 NVIDIA\u2019s NVDA Q4 and FY24 results.\nThe stock has been on a tear over the last year thanks to the AI frenzy, with shares up more than 230% during the period. Investors took its quarterly print in stride, pushing shares higher post-earnings. Let\u2019s take a closer look at a few key metrics from the release.\nNVIDIA Q4 \nThe company delivered Q4 revenue of a record $22.1 billion, up 27% sequentially and a sizable 409% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP EPS totaled $5.16, climbing 28% sequentially and 485% from the year-ago period.\nBoth items exceeded our consensus earnings and revenue expectations, penciling in beats of 13% and 8%, respectively.\nData Center\nOf course, Data Center was the real highlight of the release, which included sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA\u2019s Data Center raked in $18.4 billion (yet again, another quarterly record) throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack.\nThe reported figure handily beat our consensus estimate of $16.9 billion by nearly 9% (or $1.4 billion). It reflected the company\u2019s fourth consecutive release of posting better-than-expected Data Center results, as we can see below.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nJensen Huang, CEO, on the results: \u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,\u201d. \nGaming\nGaming revenue growth was also robust, with quarterly revenue of $2.9 billion 56% higher year-over-year. It\u2019s also worth noting that the company launched its GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs throughout the period, with generative AI capabilities for over 100 million RTX AI PCs also announced.\nSimilar to Data Center results, the reported figure exceeded our consensus estimate by 7% (or $186 million), continuing a recent streak of better-than-expected Gaming results.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nIt was another robust quarter for market-favorite NVIDIA NVDA, with the company continuing to enjoy robust growth stemming from AI demand. Unsurprisingly, shares jumped following the release, reflecting investors\u2019 positive sentiment.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "How much are Nvidia's rivals investing in startups? We investigated",
        "Author": "  Kyle Wiggers ",
        "Text": "Over the past couple of years, Nvidia, by far the largest AI chipmaker, has ramped up its investments in startups that propel it deeper into the AI space. According to S&P Global and Crunchbase, the funding and investment database, Nvidia's startup investments jumped 280% year-over-year from 2022 to 2023, with the company and its VC arm, Nvidia Ventures, participating in ~46 deals last year.\nIt's not the only one. Nvidia's chief rivals in the AI chip space -- AMD, Arm and Intel -- have been investing aggressively in startups, too, looking to make up ground in markets inclusive of the especially frothy generative AI segment.\nWe at TechCrunch were curious to see how the investments stacked up between the top AI chipmakers -- Nvidia, AMD, Arm and Intel. So we pored over Crunchbase data, with an eye toward recent activity from each chipmaker and their VC divisions.\nOf Nvidia's competitors, Intel far and away has the biggest startup investment operation thanks to Intel Capital, its long-running VC. In 2023, Intel Capital deployed over $350 million across its investments, including OpenAI rival AI21 Labs, identity risk management platform Grip Security, app delivery network Fly.io and workplace safety outfit TuMeke.\nCrunchbase data isn't exhaustive. But it shows that Intel Capital participated in 32 startup deals in 2023, down from 47 in 2022. Intel also directly invested in two startups last year (Hugging Face and Twelve Labs), per Crunchbase, plus made a \"non-equity\" investment in payment infrastructure startup Tweed (via Intel's Ignite accelerator) -- bringing its grand total deal count to 34 in 2023 and 47 in 2022.\nCrunchbase lists Intel as having invested in Vanguard SemiConductor and Aleph Alpha, but a spokesperson tells TechCrunch that's incorrect, so we've excluded them from the count.\nCuriously, AI startups -- despite their strategic importance to the chip industry these days -- make up a relatively small portion of Intel's venture portfolio. According to Crunchbase, Intel's holdings in software, IT and enterprise SaaS companies far outnumber its AI startup holdings by deal volume.\nThat could change as Intel seeks to deliver new software products and services, including GenAI-powered products, that make its hardware more attractive for a range of AI applications. Just in January, Intel spun out a company, Articul8 AI, to build GenAI solutions running on Intel chips for enterprises in the aerospace, financial services, telecommunications and semiconductor industries.\nArm might not be a particularly active startup investor compared to Intel. But the company, which makes most of its money licensing chipsets it designs to customers, has several direct investment deals as well as deals through Deeptech Labs, a VC fund and accelerator that Arm co-launched with the University of Cambridge, Cambridge Innovation Capital and Martlet Capital.\nLast year, Arm made four direct investments in startups -- microprocessor venture SiPearl, eSIM security company Kigen and Raspberry Pi and the Raspberry Pi Foundation -- and six investments through Deeptech Labs. Beneficiaries of the Deeptech Labs cash included Nu Quantum, a quantum networking startup; RoboK, which is building 3D sensing tech; and Perceptual Robotics, a provider of automated wind turbine inspection tech.\nAltogether, then, Arm poured money into 10 startups in 2023. That's a significant uptick from 2022, when Arm invested in just four companies -- a direct investment in the open source hardware startup Arduino and three investments through Deeptech Labs (Waku Robotics, Xapien and SonicEdge).\nOne presumes Arm's future investments will rope in AI in a more obvious way, given that the company's betting on sales of both its data center and consumer AI chips to steeply increase this year.\nAMD has a VC org of its own, AMD Ventures, through which it invests in startups. But for AMD, the deals come relatively few and far between.\nLast year, AMD Ventures made a handful of investments, participating in the Series A for Ethernovia, a startup building a family of ethernet chips and software, and investing in rounds for Essential AI, which looks to pioneer AI-powered software automation tech; Moreh, a company creating tools to optimize AI models; and Hugging Face (alongside Intel and Nvidia). The year before, AMD inked a single deal with Radian Arc, an infrastructure-as-a-service platform for cloud gaming and AI -- and made no other investments.\nAMD's deal total in 2023 came to four -- on the conservative side compared to rivals. But 2024 may look a bit different. Contacted for comment, AMD had this to share from Matthew Hein, the company's chief strategy officer of corporate development:\nAMD Ventures has ramped up its investment activity in the past year and is looking to accelerate further in 2024, targeting reaching a double-digit investment level. We invest across stages, supporting promising early startups poised to become market leaders, as well as mature later stage companies. Most of our new investments in 2024 will be targeting the AI ecosystem, including AI platforms, generative model companies and AI infrastructure offerings.\n2024 will be a pivotal year for AMD in other respects. The company's ramping up production of its MI300 AI chip, which is designed to handle AI workloads in data centers, and launching Ryzen 8040, its mobile AI-accelerated processors bound for laptops.\nSo it's true: Nvidia isn't the only chipmaker investing in early ventures. But it does appear to be outgunning the competition. In the first three quarters of 2023 alone, Nvidia funneled nearly a billion dollars to \"non-affiliated\" firms, per the earlier S&P Global report -- a figure even Intel Capital struggled to match.\nSuccess in the AI chipmaking space needn't entail fostering a robust startup ecosystem. But it's clear that Nvidia, one of the world's most valuable companies with control of about 95% of the market for AI chips, is playing for keeps -- attempting to shore up dominance by spreading its financial influence far and wide.\nI'd say its rivals have their work cut out for them.\n"

        "Author": " Karen Friar    and Hamza Shaban    ",
        "Text": "March arrived with a bang on Wall Street as stocks set new records, fueled by a promising inflation reading and a relentless tech rally, which saw Nvidia closing with a market cap above $2 trillion for the first time.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.8%, setting a new high. The S&P 500 has risen 16 out of 18 weeks, chugging along after passing 5,000 for the first time last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2% or just under 100 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) rose 1.1%, claiming a record of its own for the second day in a row.\nStocks are kicking off March with an upbeat reaction to PCE data that showed inflation continued to cool \u2014 easing worries the Federal Reserve would get more reason to hold off from interest rate cuts. But further scrutiny has highlighted signs of \"sticky\" inflation that will be harder to shift.\nAmong big movers, Nvidia (NVDA), the tech company at the center of the AI excitement on Wall Street ended the day with a market cap exceeding $2 trillion for the first time. Meanwhile, shares in New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) tumbled 26% after the exit of its CEO, a $2.7 billion quarterly loss, and findings of \"material weaknesses\" in the bank's loan processes. Finally, Dell (DELL) shares rose 31% in the wake of a quarterly sales and profit beat fueled by AI prospects for its servers.\nDevelopments at OpenAI caught the attention of investors tracking the sector. Elon Musk has sued the Microsoft-backed (MSFT) company and its CEO Sam Altman, among others, over a breach of contract. Also, the ChatGPT maker is reportedly set to name new board members in March to end an impasse linked to Altman's abrupt firing last year.\nThe February rally never ended and now the March rally has begun.\nTwo major indexes claimed record highs Friday, fueled by the excitement around tech's AI moment.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.8%, setting a new high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2% or just under 100 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) rose 1.1%, claiming a record close for the second day in a row.\nTarget (T), Costco (COST), and Box (BOX) are among the major names to report next week, as the earnings winds down but continues to ramp up Wall Street's optimism, propelling market to new highs.\nFebruary's jobs report will inform Fed officials as they continue to weigh economic data leading up to the their next policy meeting later this month. As growth resurges and stubborn inflation pressures remain, some officials have tempered expectations that rate cuts will arrive soon. The Fed will release heir updated forecasts on March 20, alongside its next monetary policy decision, which Wall Street expects to go unchanged.\nThursday's inflation reading of the Fed's preferred measure the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4% over the prior month in January. And compared to a month ago, the market is more confident that a rate cut wont arrive until June.\nInvestors and and policymakers will also be on the lookout for the latest data on job openings and labor turnover pinned to January 2024, providing more insight into employers' staffing prospects and the confidence of job seekers.\nYahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week:\nSave your condolences for the death of the AppleCar and send your congratulations. Who needs an expensive, low-margin electric vehicle when you have ambiguous hopes for AI?\nAfter an ill-fated, decade-long odyssey, Apple has said goodbye to its car project and will redirect resources to its artificial intelligence division. A blow to all who longed to see exactly which generation Fiat 500 Jony Ive would have paid homage to.\nIf the decision was an admission of defeat \u2014 Elon Musk responded to the news on X with an emoji of a salute and a cigarette \u2014 it didn't feel like one. The collective response from several analysts and the market was something close to \"good riddance.\"\nScuttling the multibillion-dollar insurgent effort will allow Cupertino to focus on a broad AI strategy within the Apple ecosystem, said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.\nOthers have pointed to the way Apple's software and intuitive design have already reshaped the car industry through CarPlay, software that connects iPhones to cars, effectively transforming other companies' hardware into extensions of its walled garden.\nMusk's recent fuss over unlocking Tesla's AI potential makes Apple's car exit even more compelling. CEO Tim Cook already has multiple conduits for intimate data gathering and platforms for refining AI tools. Musk's vehicles are parked outside; Cook's screens tuck you in at night.\nBut there's something too on the nose and a little bleak about the world's most valuable company shuffling staff from its daring EV project to the trend of the moment, pursuing a more dazzling version of ChatGPT, or finding immersive ways to sink users more deeply into their couch. You'd think the phrase \"If you can't beat em, join em\" shouldn't apply to an enterprise packing hundreds of billions of dollars to throw at a problem.\nAt the company's annual shareholder meeting earlier this week, Cook said Apple will share details of its new AI features later this year. It's still not clear how AI will resuscitate Apple's growth story. But at least now we know where it won't come from.\nLegacy media is facing a two-pronged conundrum: TV networks are in decline as a dismal ad environment drags on revenue. In the meantime, streaming remains unprofitable for the majority of players as costs rise and subscriber growth stalls.\nMost recently, Paramount (PARA) reported linear ad revenue slumped 15% year over year in Q4, steeper than the 12% drop expected by analysts and also worse than the 14% drag seen in the third quarter.\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA) also saw ad revenue in their traditional broadcast and cable businesses slump this earnings season.\nIt's a tough spot for media companies, which have invested in expensive streaming endeavors amid the mass exodus of pay TV consumers.\nPrior to the cord-cutting phenomenon, linear advertising and cable affiliate fees had consistently boosted revenues. But as ad buyers now flee traditional TV channels in favor of digital options like streaming, companies are beginning to realize that they may never see the same level of returns.\nAdding on to financial pressures? The streaming boom may be over.\n\"The headlines have been unavoidable suggesting that the boom times are over and streaming video is in a new phase of sobriety,\" subscription analytics platform Antenna wrote in its quarterly \"State of Subscriptions\" report published on Tuesday.\nAntenna revealed that subscribers to premium subscription services grew at their slowest pace since before the pandemic began, rising just 10.1% compared to the 21.6% seen in 2022.\nOn top of slowing growth, churn \u2014 or subscribers canceling their streaming plans \u2014 has nearly tripled since 2019 with 140.5 million cancellations in 2023, the largest drop in subscribers over the last five years.\nAs consumer sign-ups slow, streaming profitability still has a long way to go.

        "Author": "  Yelin  Mo and Brenda Goh ",
        "Text": "By Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh\nBEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Nvidia has started taking pre-orders for a new China-specific artificial intelligence (AI) chip from distributors who are pricing it on par with a rival product from Huawei, sources familiar with the matter said.\nThe graphics card, the H20, is the most powerful of three Nvidia has been developing for the Chinese market after the U.S. expanded bans on high-end chip exports, aiming to hamper China's ability to develop AI and sophisticated computers for its military.\nThe H20 will naturally deliver less computing power than Nvidia's flagship H100 AI chip and the H800 - the later China-specific card that was also banned in October.\nBut specifications for the H20 also appear to indicate it is less powerful than Huawei's Ascend 910B in some key areas, according to three sources, who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.\nNvidia has in recent weeks been pricing orders for H20 distributors in China in a range of $12,000 to $15,000 per card, according to two sources.\nSome distributors have started advertising the chips with a significant markup to the lower end of that range at about 110,000 yuan ($15,320), one of the sources said. By comparison, Huawei's 910B is being sold for around 120,000 yuan, two of the sources said.\nNvidia declined to comment.\nOne source said distributors are offering H20 servers, which are pre-configured with 8 of the AI chips, for 1.4 million yuan. By comparison, servers that used 8 of the H800 chips were sold at around 2 million yuan when they were launched a year ago.\nDistributors have told clients they will be able to start delivering the H20 products in small batches in the first quarter of 2024 and in larger quantities from the second quarter, the source added.\nBefore the U.S. curbs, Nvidia dominated China's AI chip market with more than 90% share. However, it currently faces increasing competition from domestic rivals, chief among them being Huawei.\nHuawei's 910B chip is widely considered the most competitive AI offering now available within China and has become more popular amid concern that buyers could be faced with further restricted access to Nvidia's products resulting from U.S. sanctions.\nIn terms of specifications, one example of where the H20 appears to lag the 910B in its FP32 performance - a critical metric that measures how quickly a chip can process common tasks and which is rated at less than half of its rival's capability, one source said.\nHowever, the H20 appears to have an advantage over the 910B in terms of interconnect speed, which measures how quickly data can transfer between chips, according to the source.\nThat means the H20 remains competitive with the 910B in applications that require linking a large number of chips together to work as a system, he said.\nReuters reported last month that Nvidia plans to begin mass production of the H20 in the second quarter of this year.\nIt was originally scheduled for launch last November but that plan was delayed, with sources saying at the time that the delay was due to issues that server manufacturers were having in integrating the chip.\nNvidia also plans to roll out two other China-specific chips, the L20 and the L2. Reuters was not able to determine the current status of the rollout for those two chips. Neither the H20, the L20 or the L2 are currently listed on Nvidia's website.\nUnderscoring the importance of the China market to Nvidia, CEO Jensen Huang visited the company's offices in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing last month for the company's annual parties before the Lunar New Year holiday, local media reported.\n($1 = 7.1780 Chinese yuan)\n(Reporting by Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n"

        "Title": "Should You Worry About Nvidia's Decline in China?",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of investors' biggest questions in recent days was whether Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), in its latest earnings report, would be able to keep up its incredible pace of triple-digit revenue growth. When the artificial-intelligence (AI) chip giant announced fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter earnings this week, it hit the ball out of the park.\nRevenue reached new records, advancing in the triple digits in the quarter and for the year. And net income also climbed in the triple digits for both periods.\nAll of this is thanks to the company's dominance in the AI chip market. It has an 80% share, and demand is increasing for its products. Nvidia's stock has reflected this, advancing more than 270% over the past year.\nBut one element in Nvidia's earnings report left a mark on the otherwise pristine picture -- the drop in Nvidia's data center revenue in China, a country that's accounted for 20% to 25% of its data center revenue in recent quarters. Should you worry about the decline?\nIt's important to consider the reason for this movement, which has to do with a U.S. ban starting late last year on high-performance chips to China and other countries considered a security threat. When the U.S. announced the move, it cited the potential for China to use the chips to produce \"advanced military systems,\" such as weapons of mass destruction.\nTo comply with the ban, Nvidia stopped exporting its top-performing chips to China. As a result, data center sales to the country dropped \"significantly\" in the fourth quarter, when the country represented a mid-single-digit percentage of data center revenue. The company expects China data center revenue to make up about the same percentage of revenue in the current quarter, too.\nWhat is Nvidia doing to address the situation? The technology giant is introducing alternative chips -- products that don't require a special license from the U.S. -- to the Chinese market. The company says it's now testing its new offering in the marketplace and aims to do its best to compete within the limits of the U.S. legislation.\nThe big risk for Nvidia is that local competitors will produce chips superior to what the American company is authorized to export to China -- and that could derail its sales there. Chinese customers may not want the slower chips at all or may accept them for a time -- until they're able to access more powerful chips at home.\nNvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said during the recent earnings call that after the end of this new quarter, \"[H]opefully we can go compete for our business and do our best, and we'll see how it turns out.\"\nLet's get back to our question: Should you worry about a drop in China revenue persisting and hurting Nvidia's growth prospects? And the answer is, not necessarily.\nTwo reasons prompt me to say this. First, data center revenue climbed across all other geographies, resulting in triple-digit gains year over year to a record level of $18.4 billion. Even with revenue considerably lower in China, Nvidia's overall data center revenue still is soaring. If we imagine the worst-case scenario -- local chipmakers taking major market share -- other geographies have what it takes to drive major growth at Nvidia.\nSecond, when it comes to its competitiveness in China, Nvidia is just getting started with alternative products. As the company communicates with customers and learns how to navigate in the new environment, we may see stronger revenue down the road. And if we don't, as I mentioned, it may not be catastrophic for this high-growth AI player.\nWhat does this mean for you as an investor? It's important to keep an eye on how things evolve in China. It's still a key market, and if Nvidia can win over customers with its new offerings and increase its growth there, the company's already bright picture could get even brighter. But if China revenue remains lackluster, it doesn't mean disaster for the company.\nNvidia remains a great buy today, thanks to its earnings gains in recent quarters and prospects in the high-growth area of AI.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are playing a major role in overall market dynamics right now. Last year, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite soared more than 40% thanks in large part to euphoria surrounding the AI narrative.\nSpecifically, the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Nvidia -- have had a major influence on the record-setting performance by the S&P 500 so far in 2024.\nBut there are many opportunities beyond those seven. One company that has experienced quite a bit of volatility over the last year is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), which works extremely closely with semiconductor leaders Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\nGiven that Super Micro Computer stock has surged 812% over the last year, it's no surprise that one Wall Street pundit has hailed the company as a \"stealth Nvidia.\"\nCould Super Micro have prospects as lucrative as Nvidia stock? Maybe. But a more thorough understanding of the company's business, underlying market trends, and valuation compared to peers should help determine if it is a buy right now.\nBoth Nvidia and AMD manufacture a series of high-end chips called graphics processing units (GPUs), which play an instrumental role in quantum computing, especially as it relates to generative AI. Super Micro does not produce semiconductors itself, but it plays an important role in how they are deployed.\nThe company specializes in designing IT architecture including server racks and storage clusters. Given the unprecedented demand for GPUs, it's not surprising that its business has been a major beneficiary.\nI'll concede that the slope of the revenue line above is impressive. However, there are some important things to consider before pouring into Super Micro.\nThe chart below illustrates the stock movements of Nvidia and Super Micro over the last year.\nNot only are both stocks up significantly, but they have also demonstrated eerily similar ebbs and flows throughout the last 12 months. As I wrote in a prior article, Super Micro's stock seems to trade almost in parallel with that of Nvidia. While some investors have undoubtedly profited from this theme, this dynamic does not come without significant risk.\nFor example, Arm Holdings is a smaller and somewhat troubled semiconductor company. But an encouraging earnings report earlier this year coupled with a newly revealed ownership stake from Nvidia sent Arm stock soaring, with its market cap nearly doubling in just a matter of days.\nWhile Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings each have some investment merit, the overlapping feature between the two companies is that both have witnessed abnormally high buying activity thanks in large part to their relationships with Nvidia.\nAs long as demand for GPUs remain high, Super Micro should remain a beneficiary one way or another. But the primary risk I see is the company's heavy reliance on Nvidia in particular.\nThe chart above benchmarks Super Micro stock against a cohort of other IT-systems integrators on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis. The analysis clearly illustrates that Super Micro's P/S of 5.3 is essentially double that of its next closest competitor, International Business Machines. Of note, IBM is a much more diversified conglomerate that even sells its own AI-powered software in addition to its many other businesses.\nThe other important thing to drive home here is that many other IT architecture companies trade at a P/S of less than 1. While it could be argued that Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell Technologies, and Lenovo have lacked innovation in recent years, the disparity among legacy players and Super Micro is tough to brush aside.\nTo me, Super Micro will need to generate market-leading revenue and profit growth in order to justify its premium valuation. But I see this as unlikely as demand for GPUs will eventually normalize, which will affect Super Micro's long-term performance. Moreover, it's paramount that the company foster and nurture relationships outside of Nvidia and AMD, since the GPU market will begin to see other players emerge -- potentially from big tech stalwarts like Amazon.\nWhile I understand Wall Street's metaphorical comparison to Nvidia, investors should understand that Super Micro and chipmakers are very different businesses. The former could represent a unique stock to own outside of traditional AI opportunities.\nBut it's important to realize that the long-term investment prospects between Super Micro and other semiconductor leaders like Nvidia are not the same and carry much different risk profiles.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Alexandra Canal    and Karen Friar    ",
        "Text": "US stocks closed in the red on Tuesday as investors looked to big retailer earnings to provide insight into consumer resilience amid doubts about the odds of a \"soft landing.\"\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the declines, dropping nearly 1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped roughly 0.2% after the three gauges closed a turbulent week lower.\nEarnings are front of mind as markets reopen after the Presidents' Day break, with quarterly reports from leading US retailers Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) providing a mixed picture. Shares of Home Depot dipped after it signaled demand has failed to pick up amid \"sticky\" inflation, while Walmart jumped as its upbeat sales outlook and dividend increase boosted the mood.\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nLooming large are Wednesday's earnings from Nvidia (NVDA), seen as a potential turning point for markets. With just a handful of megacap stocks driving the lion's shares of gains, any shortfall amid high hopes for the AI-focused chipmaker \u2014 the third-biggest company by market value \u2014 risks a pullback for stocks more broadly.\nUS stocks closed lower across the board on Tuesday.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the declines, dropping nearly 1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped roughly 0.2%.\nEarnings from Nvidia, due Wednesday, could be a potential turning point for markets as investors eye big results from Wall Street's AI darling.\nA soft housing market has weighed on the home improvement sector over the past year, and signs of a turnaround could remain elusive in 2024, according to the country's biggest home improvement retailer.\n\"I'd say we have a neutral look on housing for 2024,\" Home Depot (HD) CEO Edward Decker said on the company's fourth quarter earnings call this morning. \"We don't think there's incremental pressure nor do we think that we're quite ready for a hockey stick recovery.\"\nHome Depot stock was up about 0.2% in afternoon trade on Tuesday.\nThe retailer said Tuesday that its fourth quarter sales declined 3% to $34.8 billion from the year-earlier period. It expects sales growth of 1% in its fiscal year 2024.\n\u201cWe have a housing market in the US that is largely in a state of paralysis. There\u2019s just not much happening right now. Lower rates will help unlock that paralysis and serve as a better driver in better sales for Home Depot,\" Oppenheimer managing director Brian Nagel told Yahoo Finance Live Tuesday morning.\nExisting home sales slumped last year given rising interest rates, limited housing inventory, and lower affordability, which in turn led to some softness around home improvement spending as turnover in the housing market slowed.\nAnd with the odds of an imminent rate cut from the Federal Reserve falling, Decker expects to see an extension of this moderation in home spending through the first half of this year.\n\"[Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail] has been talking for some time [about] the Fed's stance of higher for longer,\" Decker added. \"I think we now we have an appreciation that longer is going to go through the first half of this year.\"\nThese comments echo what others in the housing industry have said of late.\n\"But the inflation numbers, if they continue to stay persistently higher, then, that calls into question whether or not the Fed is going to cut three times, maybe they only cut two, and then when do they cut?\" NAHB CEO Jim Tobin told Yahoo Finance Live last week.\n\"This idea that they're going to cut in the spring seems to be off the table now.\"\nIt's almost Nvidia (NVDA) earnings day!\nI hope you have preordered your food delivery for tomorrow night so you can place full attention on CEO Jensen Huang's earnings call. For to miss Huang's comments could mean not good things for your broader portfolio of tech stocks if he says something bad (and the opposite if he really delivers an effortless earnings call).\nBut before that call, below are some impactful new stats from the strategy team over Goldman Sachs.\nI think they go a long way to explaining why Nvidia and the Magnificent Seven have become such an important driver of stock prices.\nThe high-water mark for Wall Street's S&P 500 (^GSPC) predictions has moved up yet again.\nThe S&P 500 has hit new record highs to kick off 2024.\nThe surge in stocks put the benchmark average above the average Wall Street strategist year-end target less than two months into the year. And now, several of those strategists are boosting their projections for how far stocks can run in 2024.\nOn Friday, Goldman Sachs boosted its year-end target from 5,100 to 5,200. Three days later, UBS also boosted its target. The UBS Investment Bank equity strategy team led by Jonathan Golub now sees the S&P 500 ending this year at 5,400, up from a prior call for 5,100. This reflects nearly an 8% increase from Monday's opening price.\n\"Despite our bullish outlook, it appears we were not bullish enough,\" Golub wrote.\nBoth Goldman Sachs and UBS expressed a more upbeat outlook for corporate earnings this year than previously forecasted when describing why they see further upside in stocks. To Goldman, an increased earnings and profit outlook for the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks is likely to drive a lion's share of the gains.\nMeanwhile, UBS points out that recent readings on stickier-than-expected inflation might not be as troublesome for stocks as initially feared.\n\"Earnings benefit from higher inflation,\" Golub wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\nHe added: \"Returns and profits are measured in nominal dollars. ... Put differently, higher inflation tends to be a positive for stock prices. While the market sold off on more robust [Consumer Price Index] and [Producer Price Index] reports last week, our work indicates that these demand-driven readings are constructive for future returns.\"\nHere are the stocks trending in mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday:\nNvidia (NVDA): The chipmaker's stock fell about 6% on Tuesday \u2014 on track for its largest percent decrease since May 2023 as the company shed about $100 billion off of its market cap. The moves come just ahead of its quarterly results on Wednesday.\nNvidia, which has greatly benefitted from the AI boom, is expected to report Q4 revenue of $20.4 billion, up 236% year over year, with earnings per share estimated to clock in at $4.60, an increase of 422% compared to the year-ago period.\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI): The company's stock fell another 10% on Tuesday following a Friday reversal after shares tripled in value in less than a month. SMCI has seen shares surge amid AI optimism with investors beginning to weigh frothiness in the market.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD), another AI darling, also saw shares fall on Tuesday, declining about 6%.\nBut analysts say there's more room to run. On Tuesday, Rosenblatt Securities increased its price target on SMCI shares to $1,300 from $700. The stock has soared nearly 700% since last year.\nWalmart (WMT): Shares climbed about 3% after the retailer reported another strong quarter of sales growth while also confirming plans to buy budget TV maker Vizio. Same-store sales climbed 4% in the quarter, driven by more shoppers going to the store more frequently.\nDiscover Financial Services (DFS): Shares surged about 15% after Warren Buffett-backed Capital One confirmed plans to acquire Discover in a $35.3 billion deal. The agreement, which is expected to receive intense antitrust scrutiny, would form the sixth-largest US bank by assets.\nUS stocks took another leg down by mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the day's declines, dropping more than 1.5%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank about 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell around 0.5%.\nAll eyes will be on Nvidia (NVDA) this week with the chipmaker set to report earnings after the bell on Wednesday.\nThe company's anticipated Q4 revenue is $20.4 billion, up 236% year over year. To put that expectation into perspective, its total 2022 revenue was $27 billion. Earnings per share are expected to clock in at $4.60, an increase of 422% compared to the year-ago period.\nStill, the stock dropped about 6% on Tuesday \u2014 on track for its largest percent decrease since May 2023 as it shed about $100 billion off of its market cap.\nNvidia has been one company that's greatly benefitted from the AI boom.\nDespite Tuesday's losses, the company boasts a current market cap of just under $1.7 trillion. That's the third-highest market cap in the world, behind only Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\nShares are up nearly 40% since the start of the year and have soared about 220% since last year.\nWednesday's report will not only be important for shares, but will also be critical for markets. \n\"If Nvidia misses or just fails to hit a home run ... that can have a gravitational effect on the whole market,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills.\nWalmart (WMT) might have just confirmed plans to acquire TV maker Vizio \u2014 but don't expect the retailer to be a content generator.\nWhile speaking in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday, Walmart CFO John David Rainey revealed the company has no plans to enter the crowded media business.\n\"That's arguably a red sea of competition and I'm not sure that that's really what we need to be focused on,\" Rainey said.\n\"I think we can provide better value on focusing some of the basics that our customers expect from us,\" he continued, adding improving its delivery and e-commerce capabilities remain top priorities.\nIn other words, Walmart doesn't seem to want to compete in the original content and streaming space, which competitor Amazon (AMZN) has certainly leaned into over the past several years after the tech giant completed its acquisition of MGM in 2022.\n\"We want to focus on the basics,\" Rainey reiterated.\nWatch the full interview here. \nWalmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) reported quarterly results before the bell on Tuesday.\nHere's what to know:\nWalmart: The retailer saw shares climb more than 5% in early trading after it reported yet another strong quarter of sales growth while also confirming plans to buy budget TV maker Vizio.\nSame-store sales climbed 4% in the quarter, compared to Bloomberg consensus estimates of 3.12%. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, the rise was driven by more shoppers going to the store more frequently. However, a slight drop in the average ticket signaled they added less to their basket.\nRead the full earnings breakdown here.\nHome Depot: Shares dipped about 1.5% after the company's guidance disappointed investors. Home Depot said it expects 1% sales growth in fiscal 2024. Wall Street was expecting closer to 1.6%.\nStill, the home improvement giant beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines, despite quarterly sales declining nearly 3% compared to the year-ago period.\nUS stocks fell on Tuesday to kick off a shortened holiday trading week.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the early morning losses, dropping roughly 0.4%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped around 0.2% after the three gauges closed a turbulent week lower.\nAll eyes now turn to earnings, with leading US retailers Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) reporting mixed quarterly results on Tuesday. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings on Wednesday.\nYours truly and the Yahoo Finance Live team are sitting down with Walmart (WMT) CFO John David Rainey today at 9:30 a.m. ET \u2014 so we plan to drill into the company\u2019s play for Vizio (VZIO) revealed this morning, along with earnings.\nAt first, you would think this deal is all about selling more TVs at Walmart during the Super Bowl or Christmas. Vizio, after all, relies on Walmart for about 50% of its annual sales.\nBut there is so much more to this deal beneath the surface, which Walmart alluded to in its press release:\nUltimately, this deal is bad news for Roku (ROKU). Shares are down 6% on the news after getting hit on deal speculation a couple of weeks back. Trade Desk (TTD) is also being sent lower by 3% \u2014 but I need to do more work on their business before saying there is a bad impact on them.\nNo real movement in shares of Best Buy (BBY) on the news, though Citi did reiterate a Sell rating on the stock this morning into earnings later this month.\nVizio shares are up 16%.\nBefore you go, a look back at Yahoo Finance's coverage of Vizio's IPO in 2021 via a chat with their CFO Adam Townsend.\nI could tell you who is probably having a busy morning: top execs at Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), and American Express (AXP) following Capital One\u2019s (COF) $35.3 billion deal for Discover (DFS).\nI suspect they will be fielding calls from investors who will be curious about their thoughts on what this transaction could mean for the future of competition in the payments space (notice I say could, because in this regulatory climate and ahead of an election, a consumer credit card deal will be very closely scrutinized by regulators).\nSome initial talking points for what this combined company will look like:\nThe vibe on the Street this morning is that the deal makes strong sense for Capital One and is the right move even if the price tag is stiff (said price tag is hitting Capital One\u2019s stock to the tune of over 3%).\nBut it\u2019s the commentary around the implications for Visa, Mastercard, and Amex that has captured most of my attention this morning(note: shares of Visa, Mastercard, and Amex are all lower).\nFor your review:\n\"According to The Nilson Report, Capital One issued debit and credit cards generated ~$600 billion in purchase volume in 2022 (3% of V/MA global volume), making it the third largest domestic issuer of V/MA credit cards (~60% of its credit card portfolio being with Mastercard according to Nilson, ~40% Visa) and the twelfth largest debit card issuer (primarily Mastercard, we believe). We expect any transition away from V/MA would likely be slow (Mastercard renewed its network partnership with Capital One in 1Q22, Visa in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2022) and portfolio by-portfolio (V/MA have a ~40% larger global acceptance network). Acknowledging Discover\u2019s network is much smaller generating 2% the volume as V/MA globally, it gives Capital One the optionality to negotiate away from (or price-down) the global networks over time, in our view.\" -JPMorgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang\n\"We believe the combination of COF and DFS should be strategically compelling from a competitive perspective vs. V/MA. At a high level, the risk to the networks is simple\u2014can COF monetize DFS\u2019s network capabilities, which historically have not gained much market share vs. the networks? COF\u2019s strong card and banking presence could prove to be the combo platter that starts a more competitive environment vs. V/MA and AMEX. Obviously, V/MA do not underwrite credit and therefore must rely on their card issuing bank relationships for direction and non-anonymized data, but in an environment of AI, whereby large 'specific' data assets are becoming more valuable, the combination of Capital One and Discover becomes more compelling, in our view. All else equal, we believe the combination could prove to be more competitive for V/MA and thus worth watching.\" -RBC analyst Daniel Perlin\n"

        "Title": "Invest with Confidence: Intrinsic Value Unveiled of NVIDIA Corp",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAs of 2024-02-26, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $379.69. It's currently trading at a price of $788.17. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -107.58%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$12.15\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.24%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 41.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n591.55\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n1000.21\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n379.69\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $338.47. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -132.86%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Take the Zacks Approach to Beat the Market: NVIDIA, Carrols, CyberArk in Focus",
        "Author": "  Abhinab Dasgupta ",
        "Text": "Last Friday, the three widely followed indexes closed out a fourth straight winning week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.4%, 1.4% and 1.1%, respectively.\nThe S&P 500 hit its all-time closing high on Friday. Investor sentiment was mixed throughout the week, with a prevailing uncertainty about the timeline for rate cuts. Currently, it is anticipated that the Fed will start cutting rates from June of this year. Mega-cap earnings numbers released throughout the week and strong numbers from the labor market kept investors optimistic.\nExpectations of a rate cut of at least 25 bps in March moved down to 20.5% to close out the week, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. With a low-data week in the offing, over the next few days, earnings would continue to dominate the headlines.\nRegardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market.\nAs usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies. Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action.\nHere are some of our key achievements:\nShares of monday.com Ltd. MNDY have gained 19.7% (versus the S&P 500\u2019s 8.6% increase) since it was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on November 28.\nAnother stock, Eaton Corporation plc ETN, which was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on November 27, has returned 18.1% (versus the S&P 500\u2019s 8.3% increase) since then.\nZacks Rank, our short-term rating system, has earnings estimate revisions at its core. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nA hypothetical portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks returned +20.63% in 2023 vs. +24.83% for the S&P 500 index and +15% for the equal-weight S&P 500 index. The portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 stocks is an equal-weight portfolio, while the S&P 500 index is a market-cap-weighted index that has been notably distorted by the concentrated performance of mega-cap stocks in 2023.\nWe are not trying to cherry-pick here. But since this Zacks Model portfolio, consisting of Zacks Rank #1 stocks, is an equal-weight portfolio, the equal-weight S&P 500 index is the appropriate benchmark for comparison. Looked at this way, this portfolio has handily outperformed the index.\nThe Zacks Model Portfolio - consisting of Zacks Rank #1 stocks \u2013 has outperformed the S&P index by more than 13 percentage points since 1988 (Through January 1st, 2024, the Zacks # 1 Rank stocks generated an annualized return of +24.18% since 1988 vs. +10.88% for the S&P 500 index).You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here >>>\nCheck monday.com\u2019s historical EPS and Sales here>>>\nCheck Eaton\u2019s historical EPS and Sales here>>>\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nShares of Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF and Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc. TAST have advanced 41.9% (versus the S&P 500\u2019s 8.8% rise) and 20.7% (versus the S&P 500\u2019s 7.8% rise) since their Zacks Recommendation was upgraded to Outperform on December 7 and December 8, respectively.\nWhile the Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon, the Zacks Recommendation aims to predict performance over the next 6 to 12 months. However, just like the Zacks Rank, the foundation for the Zacks Recommendation is trends in earnings estimate revisions.\nThe Zacks Recommendation classifies stocks into three groups \u2014 Outperform, Neutral and Underperform. While these recommendations are determined quantitatively, our analysts have the flexibility to override them for the 1100+ stocks they closely follow based on their better judgment of factors such as valuation, industry conditions and management effectiveness than the quantitative model.\nTo access our research reports with Zacks Recommendations for the 1100+ stocks we cover, click here>>>\nShares of NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, which belongs to the Zacks Focus List, have gained 36.9% over the past 12 weeks.

        "Text": "(This Feb. 14 story has been corrected to change stock performance to 'nearly 240%' from 65%, in paragraph 2)\nBy David Randall\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Several well-known funds jumped into shares of chipmaker Nvidia at the end of last year, securities filings showed on Wednesday, potentially setting themselves up to benefit from the nearly 50% gain the stock has notched so far in 2024.\nNvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build artificial intelligence into their products and services, with investor excitement over the new technology sending the stock up nearly 240% last year.\nThe chipmaker overtook Alphabet as the third most valuable U.S. company on Wednesday, with a market capitalization of $1.78 trillion.\nAmong the funds adding new stakes in Nvidia were Rokos Capital Management, which bought more than 254,000 shares, a stake worth more than $126 million as of the end of December.\nBridgewater Associates, the hedge fund founded by billionaire Ray Dalio, increased its stake in Nvidia by 458% to more than 268,000 shares. The position was valued at $133 million at the end of December.\nArrowstreet Capital, meanwhile, added 3.9 million shares to its previous small position, leaving it with a $2.1 billion position.\nSome funds, meanwhile, sold all or part of their stakes.\nGreg Poole's Echo Street Capital Management sold all of its more than 355,000 shares. D1 Capital Partners sold nearly 147,000 shares, closing out its position, while Discovery Capital Management sold its about 119,000 shares, which had been 9.2% of its prior portfolio.\nThe positions were revealed in securities filings known as 13Fs that hedge funds and other institutional investors file at the end of each quarter. While they are backward-looking and do not reveal current holdings or short positions, the filings are one of the few ways to gain insight into the portfolios of often-secretive funds.\nNvidia will release its quarterly earnings results on Feb. 21. Analysts, on average, see the company's January fiscal quarter revenue more than tripling to $20.37 billion, fueled by demand for its top-shelf AI chips, according to LSEG data.\nAnalysts see its adjusted net profit surging more than 400% to $11.38 billion.\n(Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Jamie Freed)\n"

        "Author": "  Keith Noonan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) stock is pulling back in Wednesday's trading. The company's share price was down 2.9% as of 3 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The otherwise red-hot artificial intelligence (AI) stock had been down as much as 4.6% earlier in the day's trading.\nWhile there isn't any business-specific news driving Supermicro's stock lower today, the company's valuation is dipping due to developments for other high-profile AI companies. In particular, news surrounding Nvidia stock and SoundHound AI stock appears to be driving sell-offs for Supermicro today.\nWhen it comes to shaping valuation moves in the broader artificial intelligence space, no company is more influential than Nvidia. The AI leader posted fourth-quarter results last week that crushed the market's expectations; the report powered big gains for its own stock and also had the effect of boosting share prices for other top AI players. On the heels of explosive gains, investors now appear to be cooling on Nvidia stock a bit.\nYesterday, Nvidia published filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealing that two members of the company's board of directors had sold shares last week. Per the public filings, board members Harvey Jones and Mark Perry sold shares worth $53 million and $11.9 million, respectively.\nWhile the stock sales don't necessarily say much about Nvidia's long-term performance outlook, they arrive at a time when investors may be wondering what the next major near-term performance catalyst for the stock will be. Nvidia's share price was down roughly 0.6% as of 3 p.m. ET and had been down roughly 2% earlier in the day. The sell-off dampened enthusiasm for Super Micro Computer and other high-profile AI names.\nFollowing explosive gains for Nvidia and Supermicro, SoundHound AI has recently emerged as the market's latest red-hot artificial intelligence stock. The company's share price has rocketed 247% higher over the last month, but recent coverage from a Northland analyst suggested that it may be time to pump the brakes a bit.\nIn a note released today, Northland's lead analyst on the company downgraded his rating on the stock from \"outperform\" to \"market perform.\" SoundHound AI stock was down 6.3% as of 3 p.m. ET and had been down as much as 14% earlier in the day, and the bearish momentum is having some mild spillover effects for Supermicro stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is Nvidia's Investment a Massive Game-Changer for SoundHound AI?",
        "Author": "  Bradley Guichard, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Companies invest in other companies all the time with no fanfare. But heads turn when a company the size and stature of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) does it. This was the case when an Nvidia filing revealed a $3.7 million position in SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). As you can see, the stock shot up overnight.\nFor perspective, SoundHound has a market cap of around $1 billion, so this investment is well under 1% of its market cap and almost nothing to Nvidia's nearly $2 trillion market cap. But this wasn't the only news. SoftBank Group, which invests in many successful tech companies (like Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM), which you can read about here), purchased 1.1 million shares in fourth-quarter 2023. Neither of these investments breaks the bank, but they have investors asking: What exactly does this SoundHound company do, and is it an excellent investment?\nThe days of a person taking your order at fast-food restaurants are ending. Sure, humans will still be needed to oversee it, but voice recognition technology will do the heavy lifting. Automobiles are also advancing voice recognition and AI-powered virtual assistants. SoundHound's tech allows people to communicate conversationally to make complex orders or queries. It's incredible stuff.\nAs shown below, SoundHound's software is already deployed by brands like White Castle, Krispy Kreme, and Jersey Mikes, so you may have already used it.\nSoundHound has plenty of competition from other tech companies, but it claims it has 260 patents that have been granted or are pending. This is tremendously valuable, even though it isn't quantified on the financial statements.\nThe implications for businesses based on cost savings and efficiency are massive. It's important to acknowledge that jobs will be affected. However, technological advancements, from cars to the internet, create more jobs in the long run.\nSoundHound makes money through royalties and subscriptions that are usage-based. In other words, the more orders, queries, or volume used, the more SoundHound gets paid. This is a terrific model because sales are recurring and increase dramatically from adoption. SoundHound's revenue has grown impressively since it went public in April 2022 to $13 million in third-quarter 2023, as depicted below.\nMore importantly, the company's backlog (revenue to be recognized in future periods) grew from $303 million to $342 million year over year.\nThe company has tremendous potential, but investors should be cautious. SoundHound isn't profitable or cash flow positive. Marketing, research, and development are expensive, and SoundHound generated cash by selling millions of shares. As you can see below, the share count is up 50% since SoundHound went public, ballooning to 242 million as of Q3.\nThis gives the company the cash it needs to grow (over $100 million on hand as of Q3 2023), but dilutes existing shareholders. Hopefully, the aggressive dilution will end soon. The company forecasts $16 million to $20 million in Q4 2023 sales and predicts becoming EBITDA positive.\nFast-growing, relatively small companies like SoundHound are difficult to value. The $1 billion market cap is expensive for an unprofitable company generating $20 million in quarterly sales. However, if SoundHound's technology keeps being adopted and sales ramp up, the current price will be a bargain.\nHere's the bottom line: Nvidia's and SoftBank's investments lend credibility but should be kept in perspective. SoundHound has a tremendous market opportunity but shaky financials. The stock is best for aggressive investors who don't mind risk.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Artificial intelligence chip wunderkind Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is closing in fast on the largest stocks on the market. Yes, a company in the highly cyclical semiconductor sector is now being valued at a market cap similar to those of much steadier, and usually high-margin software businesses.\nOne analyst suggests this situation may not be as outlandish as it looks.\nOn Wednesday, investment bank Susquehanna raised its price target on Nvidia stock by 36%, to $850 a share, ahead of next week's earnings report for fiscal year 2024.\nConsensus forecasts have Nvidia more than quintupling its Q4 2022 earnings in Q4 2023. Profits should come in at $4.55 per share. That's even better than the forecast for Nvidia's sales, which are expected to \"only\" triple to $20.3 billion.\nSusquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland expects the AI superstar to exceed even these lofty expectations in the Feb. 21 report. Rolland sees Nvidia \"beating\" by at least $1.5 billion in quarterly sales, reporting $99 billion in sales for its fiscal 2025.\nFor Nvidia investors, that sounds like good news. But is it good enough to justify more than the current price of $730 per Nvidia share? Yes, perhaps.\nIf Rolland is right about Nvidia generating $99 billion in sales this year, that's more than twice the company's $45.9 billion in trailing revenue -- more than doubling. And earnings could grow even faster, as Nvidia is raising prices on its chips.\nGranted, Nvidia stock looks expensive at 95 times earnings. But by meeting these targets, Nvidia's PEG ratio will actually fall below 1.0, the usual rule of thumb for identifying a value stock.\nYes, indeed. Even at $1.8 trillion in market cap, Nvidia could be a value stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) we really liked what we saw.\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on NVIDIA is:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.46 = US$21b \u00f7 (US$54b - US$9.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).\nSo, NVIDIA has an ROCE of 46%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 10%.\n See our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for NVIDIA compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for NVIDIA.\nInvestors would be pleased with what's happening at NVIDIA. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 46%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 274%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\nIn summary, it's great to see that NVIDIA can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And a remarkable 1,717% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if NVIDIA can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\nIf you'd like to know about the risks facing NVIDIA, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia have shot up 206% in the past year as the massive demand for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) chips triggered rapid growth in its top and bottom lines.\nThat rally has also lifted the broader semiconductor sector, as shown by the 49% gain in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index in the past year. But not all components of the index have benefited equally. ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) is one such example.\nShares of the Dutch chipmaking equipment company have jumped only 32% in the past year, underperforming the index and Nvidia by a big margin. But all that could change very soon -- ASML stock shot up nearly 9% after the company released its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jan. 24. Let's see why Wall Street gave those results a big thumbs-up.\nASML finished 2023 with total revenue of 27.5 billion euros ($29.8 billion), up 30% over the previous year. Its fourth-quarter revenue of $7.84 billion, however, increased at a slower 12% over the prior year.\nThe good news was that ASML's top line exceeded the $7.43 billion consensus estimate. The company's earnings of $5.64 per share were also well ahead of the $5.16 Wall Street predicted.\nThe slower year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter can be attributed to the slowdown in semiconductor equipment spending last year, which is estimated to have been 15% lower. This explains why ASML saw a decline in orders in 2023. The company's net bookings, which refers to all the system sales orders for which it has received written authorizations, fell to $21.7 billion from $33.2 billion in 2022.\nWhat's more, management adopted a cautious approach on guidance. The company expects 2024 revenue to remain at last year's levels, which means that its growth could drop sharply this year.\nThat cautious guidance could be attributed to the drop in orders last year, but ASML adds that there are \"positive signs\" in the semiconductor industry and the company is witnessing an improvement in utilization levels.\nThis is evident from the sharp increase in ASML's orders in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company received net bookings worth $10 billion in the fourth quarter, a huge jump from $2.8 billion in the preceding quarter.\nThe year-over-year growth in bookings was 46%. Analysts would have settled for net bookings worth just $3.9 billion, but ASML knocked it out of the park with a substantially stronger order book.\nThe reason behind this significant outperformance is simple: AI. The company's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines are used for manufacturing chips based on advanced process nodes, allowing chipmakers to produce\u00a07-nanometer (nm), 5nm, and 3nm chips.\nThe demand for these advanced chip nodes, especially 5nm and 3nm, is booming thanks to AI. That's because chips manufactured using these smaller process nodes carry more computing power and are more power efficient -- ideal for AI workloads.\nNvidia, for instance, is expected to move to a 3nm manufacturing node for its next-generation H200 data center GPUs (graphics processing units) in 2024. Its new GPU is expected to have more than double the performance of the current H100, which is manufactured on an advanced 5nm node.\nWith the demand for AI chips predicted to increase at an annual rate of 38% through 2032, according to Allied Market Research, chipmakers are aggressively placing orders for ASML's EUV lithography machines.\nThe company received $6.1 billion worth of orders for its EUV machines last quarter, which was 60% of the total orders. On a year-over-year basis, EUV bookings jumped 65% from $3.7 billion in the 2022 fourth quarter. The demand for ASML's EUV machines could increase further as the AI chip market gains momentum.\nInvestors should also note that ASML exited 2023 with a massive order backlog of $42.3 billion, which is more than the company's 2024 revenue forecast. So, it won't be surprising to see ASML outpacing its prediction and delivering stronger growth this year.\nASML is also expecting to achieve \"significant growth\" from 2025 following this year's flat performance, which explains why analysts have substantially raised their forecasts for the next two years.\nASML is a much cheaper AI bet when compared to Nvidia right now. ASML is trading at 11 times sales and 40 times trailing earnings. These multiples are lower than Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 34 and trailing earnings multiple of 81. ASML's forward multiples are lower than Nvidia's readings as well.\nHowever, ASML might not be available at such attractive multiples in the future given the increase in the company's AI business, its impressive backlog, and the sharp jump that analysts are expecting in its revenue from next year.\nThat's why investors looking to buy an AI stock that's cheaper than Nvidia right now, but one that could go on a bull run, should consider buying ASML while it is still trading at relatively affordable levels.\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and ASML wasn't one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Nvidia (NVDA) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 39.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 64.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -2.8%.\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\nRight now, Nvidia has an S/TA ratio of 0.95, which means that the company gets $0.95 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.72, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\nIn addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Nvidia is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 54.7% this year versus the industry average of 3.7%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Nvidia is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For investors looking to find parallels between today's stock market and other points in history, some have made concerning comparisons to the dot-com bubble, in which the Nasdaq Stock Market fell by 75% in just over 2\u00bd years.\nEven J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) strategists have flagged some similarities to the era. A recent note by analyst Khuram Chaudhry said, \"Parallels to the \u2018Dotcom Bubble' era are often dismissed due to the \u2018irrational exuberance' that characterized this period. In this note, we demonstrate that there are a plethora of similarities between these two periods.\"\nAt the time, valuations were extreme but justified by the market given a then-expected surge in future demand caused by the internet boom.\nDon't Miss:\nNew in startups \u2013 Fortnite\u2019s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\nDid you know StartEngine Private is your portal to investing in venture-backed businesses without spending millions?\nSun Microsystems Inc. was a poster child of the dot-com era, reaching as high as $250 per share only to fall back to $10 per share near the end of 2002.\nSun Co-Founder and CEO Scott McNealy told Bloomberg around that time that it was obvious his company was ridiculously overvalued.\n\"Two years ago, we were selling at 10 times revenues when we were at $64.

That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D [research and development] for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate.\nTrending: This startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents \u2013 what\u2019s the catch?\n\"Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don't need any transparency. You don't need any footnotes. What were you thinking?\"\nMcNealy explained how challenging it is to live up to lofty market expectations, especially when a high price to sales is used by analysts to value stock prices.\nThe price-to-sales metric continues to be used and explains how much investors are willing to pay for $1 of a company's sales.\nWhile McNealy explains why a 10 times price-to-sales is high, investors have had no problem bidding up Nvidia Corp.'s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock price, giving them a 32.27 price-to-sales ratio.\nInvestors scared off by a lofty price-to-sales metric would have missed out on a massive gain in Nvidia's stock, which is up around 235% in the past year and close to 2,000% over the past five years, even though its price-to-sales has been higher in the past than it is today.\nIn July 2023, for example, its price-to-sales ratio was as high as 45.8 and even ended 2021 over 30, well before the artificial intelligence (AI) boom started.\nThis goes to show that companies can live up to their high expectations but are required to maintain and increase their incredibly fast growth just to keep their stock prices at today's levels and allow for future appreciation.\nAny companies looking to compete with Nvidia will be working to eat into their margins and gain market share, meaning investors buying and holding Nvidia today better hope they can maintain their dominant position for years to come.\nRead Next:\nHarvard-founded AI startup is solving paywalls, growing 5x yearly and looking for new shareholders.\nThis startup in the climate tech industry could unlock the riches flowing 30 feet above your head.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article This Tech Bubble CEO's Warning Resurfaces After Nvidia's Blockbuster Earnings \u2014 'What Were You Thinking? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 March 1, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA and Celsius Holdings CELH.\nEarnings season continues to wind down, with the bulk of notable companies already delivering quarterly results. The cycle has primarily been positive, underpinned by the Technology sector's strong performance that has uplifted the overall earnings picture.\nAnd throughout the period, there have been several companies delivering results that reflected quarterly records, including Apple, NVIDIA and Celsius Holdings.\nLet's take a closer look at each.\nApple\nMarket-favorite Apple posted quarterly sales of nearly $120 billion and record EPS of $2.18, exceeding our consensus expectations by 1.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Sales grew 2% year-over-year, whereas EPS showed 16% growth.\nStill, EPS wasn't the only quarterly record, as Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and grew 11% from the same period last year. Services revenue has become a nice growth driver for Apple overall, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone.\nIt's worth noting that the reported figure modestly fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate, snapping a streak of recent surprises.\nShares couldn't hold positivity post-earnings, with AAPL shares down nearly 7% YTD and underperforming the S&P 500 by a notable margin.\nNVIDIA \nNVIDIA's quarterly release stole the market spotlight, undoubtedly the most highly-awaited release of the period following an unbelievable growth story stemming from the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe company generated record Q4 revenue of $22.1 billion and posted EPS of $5.16, reflecting remarkable growth rates of 409% and 485%, respectively. Both items exceeded our consensus earnings and revenue expectations, representing beats of 13% and 8%, respectively.\nUnsurprisingly, Data Center results were the real highlight of the release, which include sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA's Data Center raked in a record $18.4 billion throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack and reflecting the unrelenting demand the company has been enjoying.\nThe reported figure blew away our consensus estimate by nearly $1.5 billion, continuing a recent streak of Data Center positivity.\nAnalysts have been revising their earnings expectations higher for the company over the last year, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nCelsius Holdings\nCelsius just delivered its latest batch of quarterly results, with Q4 revenue of $347 million 95% higher than the year-ago period and reflecting a record. Quarterly earnings totaled $0.17 per share, above our consensus estimate and well above the $0.01 per share mark in the same period last year.\nShares have soared following the print, up a sizable 170% just over the last year.\nResults were driven by strength across both International and North American markets, with sales of each growing 97% and 68% year-over-year, respectively. The company continues to win over new customers, also seeing an uptick in consumption occasions.\nEarnings season is slowly grinding to a halt, as the majority of notable companies have already delivered quarterly results. The Q4 cycle turned out to be positive, underpinned by the Technology sector's strong growth.\nAnd throughout the period, several companies, including those above, have posted quarterly records.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc. META, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Micron Technology Inc. MU.\nThe Nasdaq Composite is back in action after an astonishing rally in 2023. The tech-heavy index soared 43.4% last year, recording its best year since 2020. The index\u2019s smooth rally suffered a small hurdle last month, although finally, it closed January on a positive note with a mere 1% gain.\nHowever, the tech-laden index has regained momentum in February. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite is up 8.3% compared with 6% gain of the S&P 500 and 2.5% of the Dow. Last week, the index advanced 2.4%, posting the fifth straight winning week and the 14th positive week in 15.\nThe tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. Some financial and technology experts believe that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe that the AI-space is yet to unfold in the U.S. and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies to produce high-end products.\nMoreover, the robust fundamentals of the U.S. economy reduce concerns of a near-term recession. Additionally, the blockbuster earnings in the last reported quarter of NVIDIA \u2014 the largest global manufacturer of generative AI chipsets \u2014 raised expectations of investors that the market for AI will show strong growth in the coming decade.\nTaiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. \u2014 the world's largest contract chipmaker \u2014 recently projected more than 20% revenue growth in 2024 on booming demand for high-end chips used in AI applications even as the broader industry faces weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\nThe World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (\u201cWSTS\u201d) projects robust growth in 2024, with an estimated surge of 13.1% annually. As estimated by WSTS, global semiconductor sales should reach $588.4 billion in 2024.\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\nGrand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\nOn Feb 9, the Biden administration announced an investment of $5 billion in a public-private consortium to support R&D activities in advanced computer chips. On Aug 9, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act. This legislation allots $50 billion to help computer chip manufacturers and ease the shortage of components vital for a range of industries.\nThe National Semiconductor Technology Center (\"NSTC\") was funded through this act with $39 billion allocated to chip manufacturers and $11 billion set aside for chip R&D purposes. The newly released $5 billion will also be given to NSTC as the government recognized NSTC as the centerpiece of the administration\u2019s R&D efforts.\nThe Biden administration has expressed concerns that the United States had a 39% share of global semiconductor and microelectronic production in 1990, which has drastically dropped to just 12% at present.\nWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite listed technology behemoths with solid exposure to AI. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nAmazon.com Inc. is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. The strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, a strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN\u2019s cloud dominance.\nAn expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN gain further momentum among customers. Robust Alexa skills and an expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. AMZN\u2019s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.4% and 39%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.\nMeta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\nMETA\u2019s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to drive growth. Reels continued to impress across both Instagram and Facebook backed by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\nMeta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.4% and 31.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.\nNVIDIA Corp. is gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. The datacenter end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\nA surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. The collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance NVDA\u2019s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVDA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 53.7% through fiscal 2024-2026.\nZacks Rank #2 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 54.7% and 64.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last seven days.\nMicrosoft Corp. has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues of MSFT rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues of MSFT were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.9% and 18.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.2% over the last 30 days.\nMicron Technology Inc. has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.\nThe expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU\u2019s chips used in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU\u2019s memory and storage.\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 42.8% and 90.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.3% over the last 30 days.\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nIt\u2019s a little-known chemical company that\u2019s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.\nThis company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks\u2019 Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.\nFree: See Our Top Stock and 4 Runners Up >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Stock market today: Asian stocks are mixed after Nvidia sets off a rally on Wall Street",
        "Author": "  ZIMO ZHONG ",
        "Text": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Asian markets were mixed on Friday after Nvidia delivered stunning results, setting off a rally in other technology companies that carried Wall Street to another record high.\nTokyo\u2019s markets were closed for a holiday, a day after they surged to an all-time high.\nU.S. futures rose while oil prices fell back.\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 0.2% to 16,705.50 and the Shanghai Composite index was virtually unchanged at 2,983.10.\nGovernment data on Wednesday showed few signs of recovery in China\u2019s real estate market, as prices of new homes in first-tier cities fell 0.4% in January from a month earlier, extending a downward trend.\nThe property sector accounts for nearly a third of China's economic activity and the industry-wide meltdown has weighed on growth and sapped the confidence of both investors and consumers.\nMarkets were higher elsewhere in Asia.\nAustralia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.4% at 7,642.30, the Kospi in Seoul added 0.5% to 2,676.57.\nIn India, the Sensex gained 0.7% and Bangkok's SET edged 0.1% higher.\nOn Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 2.1% to 5,087.03, an all-time high. The Nasdaq rose 3% to 16,041.62.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has a smaller weighting in tech stocks, jumped 1.2%, to 39,069.11. That marks its first close above 39,000.\nNvidia\u2019s stock price surged Thursday after delivering another blowout quarter, setting off a rally in other technology companies that carried Wall Street to another record high.\nThe chipmaker, which soared 16.4%, reported scorching demand for its semiconductors. Its stock has tripled over the past year thanks to a surge in investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Synopsis, which makes software used to test and develop chips, rose 6.9% after raising its profit forecast.\nOther chipmakers and companies involved in the chipmaking industry also gained ground. Advanced Micro Devices rose 10.7% and Lam Research added 4.7%.\nTechnology stocks have been the driving force behind the market\u2019s rally that started in October. Solid earnings from some of the biggest names in the sector are helping justify and reinforce those gains.\nWall Street expects just under 4% growth for earnings in the overall S&P 500 during the fourth quarter. The communication services sector, which includes Google's parent Alphabet, is expected to report 45% growth. Information technology companies, which include Nvidia, are expected to notch 22% growth.\n\u201cThe near-term momentum in AI-related stocks is likely to continue,\u201d said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.\nNearly 90% of companies in the S&P 500 have reported earnings. There are still a few big names left to report over the next several weeks, including Lowe's, Dollar Tree and Best Buy.\nWall Street's focus on earnings this week follows economic data from the previous week that prompted a stumble in the market. Inflation data came in hotter than Wall Street expected, while retail sales fell more than anticipated. That raised concerns about the timing of hoped-for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.\nWall Street is now betting that the central bank will start trimming its benchmark rate in June, rather than March.\nInvestors could get more clarity on inflation next week when the government releases its monthly report on personal consumption and expenditures, the Fed\u2019s preferred measure. The Fed is trying to get inflation back down to its target of 2%. Analysts expect that report to show inflation cooled to 2.3% in January. It peaked at 7.1% in June of 2022.\nBond yields were relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.33% from 4.32% late Wednesday.\nIn energy trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 36 cents to $78.25 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 31 cents to $82.39 per barrel.\nThe U.S. dollar was trading at 150.50 Japanese yen, down slightly from 150.51 yen. The euro rose to $1.0831 from $1.0827.\n"

        "Title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, Microsoft, Cadence Design Systems, ASML Holdings and Arista Networks",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 February 15, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Cadence Design Systems CDNS, ASML Holdings ASML and Arista Networks ANET.\nAlthough we have all become very familiar with the Artificial Intelligence darlings like Nvidia and Microsoft, there are a handful of companies that are quietly powering this revolution, creating the tools and infrastructure that enable AI's remarkable capabilities.\nWhile AI advancements grab headlines, these companies play a crucial, yet often unseen, role in its development. Here, we dive into three such companies:\nIt is also worth noting that these companies aren't overly reliant on the burgeoning technology either, as the stocks have been mega-performers in their own right. Cadence Design Systems, ASML Holdings, and Arista Networks have all trounced the broad market over the last decade, further cementing them as worthy investment considerations.\nImagine intricate blueprints for miniaturized cities teeming with billions of transistors. That's what Cadence Design Systems does, providing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software that helps design and verify complex integrated circuits (ICs), the brains powering everything from smartphones to AI supercomputers.\nCadence plays a crucial role in developing the specialized chips needed for AI applications. Their tools enable engineers to create efficient, high-performance AI chips with features like specialized processing units and optimized memory access. As AI demands grow, so too will the need for advanced EDA solutions, potentially boosting Cadence's prospects.\nCadence Design Systems currently enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Expectations have been upgraded across timeframes for the chip designer.\nCDNS stock is already up 10.4% YTD, showing considerable momentum.\nAt the heart of chip manufacturing lies ASML Holdings, the undisputed leader in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems. These complex machines etch minuscule circuit patterns onto silicon wafers, enabling the creation of ever-denser, more powerful chips.\nEUV lithography is crucial for producing the advanced chips needed for AI applications. ASML's dominance in this space positions them as a key player in enabling the AI revolution.\nAlthough ASML has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, signaling a mixed earnings revisions trend, it still has a lot going for.\nASML sits in the top 7% of the Zacks Industry Rank and boasts very impressive EPS growth forecasts over the next 3-5 years. Over that period, earnings are expected to climb 20.3% annually. Additionally, ASML has a near-monopoly in EUV lithography, which has incredibly high barriers of entry and recurring revenues, securing its business future.\nThe stock market has been strong since the start of the year, but ASML Holdings has been stronger. The stock is up an incredible 21.3% YTD.\nAs AI models grow larger and more complex, efficient communication between data centers becomes crucial. Enter Arista Networks, a leader in high-performance data center networking solutions.\nArista's switches and routers are specifically designed to handle the demanding workloads of AI applications, enabling efficient data transfer and communication between AI systems.\nAs can be seen in the chart below, both ANET's share price and earnings revision trend have been steadily climbing higher over the past three years. Arista Networks has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, further increasing the odds of another advance in the share price.\nANET stock has already rallied 13.7% YTD, demonstrating strong demand from investors.\nBecause none of these stocks are household names, investors who can dive a little deeper into the minutiae of the industry can gain a real edge. But don't get it twisted, just because they aren't well known doesn't mean their contributions aren't vital to technological development.\nBy enabling the creation of specialized chips, building the manufacturing foundation, and facilitating high-speed data communication, they're laying the groundwork for AI's continued advancement.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Checking the Average Zacks Price Target for Nvidia's Stock Before Earnings",
        "Author": "  Shaun Pruitt ",
        "Text": "Seeing if Nvidia (NVDA) can deliver on its lofty Q4 expectations after the closing bell today has been circulating through investors' minds. After all, high demand for its AI chips has boosted Nvidia\u2019s stock over +200% in the last year and NVDA shares are already up +30% year to date.\nThe perplexity comes as NVDA shares have dipped more than -10% from their 52-week highs of $756.11 a share seen earlier in the month. Some investors may be contemplating\u00a0on taking profits while others may be eying their entry point and wondering if the fall to under $700 a share is just a brief pause before Nvidia\u2019s stock rips higher.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPrice Target & Broker Recommendations\nAwaiting the analysis of Nvidia\u2019s Q4 results this evening investors may be scouring through analyst price targets. Based on the short-term price targets offered by 38 analysts, the Average Zacks Price Target of $724.19 a share currently implies 7% upside with NVDA shares down roughly -3% to around $674 a share in this morning's trading session.\nNotably, 35 out of 40 brokerage firms covering Nvidia\u2019s stock and offering data to Zacks have a strong buy rating at the moment with 2 at a buy and 3 at a hold. This gives Nvidia a very favorable ABR (average broker recommendation) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nQ4 Expectations & Earnings Estimate Revisions\nTaking a last look at Nvidia\u2019s Q4 projections before results this evening the Zacks Consensus for earnings is at $4.55 per share which would represent 417% growth from $0.88 per share in the comparative quarter. Fourth quarter sales are projected to increase 235% to $20.31 billion.\nOverall, Nvidia is expected to round out its fiscal 2024 with annual earnings climbing 270% to $12.36 per share and total sales increasing 119% to $59.13 billion. More importantly, the trend of earnings estimate revisions has been positive with FY24 EPS estimates slightly up over the last 60 days while FY25 EPS estimates have risen 3%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile investors may be on edge for Nvidia\u2019s Q4 results the number of brokers recommending its stock is very reassuring. To that point, Nvidia\u2019s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) attributed to rising earnings estimate revisions and a post-earnings rally wouldn\u2019t be surprising if the chip giant can reach or exceed its lofty Q4 expectations.\u00a0\u00a0\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 February 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA.\nWe have seen some awe-inspiring results from Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon in recent days that reconfirm their leadership position in this market.\nThese companies, along with their peers in the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 group of stocks \u2013 Apple, Alphabet, Tesla and Nvidia \u2013 led the market higher last year, and that momentum has continued this year.\nOther than Tesla, whose results disappointed the market once again and reflected the fourth quarter in a row of disappointing results, all of the other Mag 7 members that have reported came out with impressive growth numbers. The market wasn\u2019t particularly impressed with the Alphabet and Apple reports, but they came out with Q4 earnings growth of +51.8% and +13.1%, respectively.\nTesla\u2019s earnings were down -45.8% in Q3 on +3.5% higher revenues, as the EV-maker continued to grapple with weakening margins in an increasingly competitive EV market.\nUsing estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its December-quarter results on February 21st, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +48.7% from the same period last year on +14.5% higher revenues.\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 28.6% of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 19.5% of the index\u2019s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 23.1% of all S&P 500 earnings.\nGiven their enormous earnings power and growth profiles, it is hard to argue with the group\u2019s market leadership. Importantly, analysts had been raising their estimates for the group even before the December-quarter results, with these numbers now adding to the positive revision momentum.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues.\nThis week\u2019s blockbuster Tech results has pushed the aggregate earnings growth picture for the S&P 500 index to +4.3% from last week\u2019s +1.1% growth pace. Excluding the contribution from the Mag 7 stocks, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -4.2%.\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, February 2nd, we now have Q4 results from 230 S&P 500 members, or 46% of the index\u2019s total membership.\nWe have more than 500 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. This week\u2019s line-up includes a who\u2019s who of the index, including Disney, Elli Lilly, MacDonalds, DuPont, Caterpillar, Ford, Pepsi, Chipotle, Uber, PayPal, Expedia, and many others.\nTotal Q4 earnings for the 230 index members that have reported already are up +4.2% from the same period last year on +2.8% higher revenues, with 81.3% beating EPS estimates and 63.9% beating revenue estimates.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q4 Earnings: Tech Flexes Strong Growth \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.
