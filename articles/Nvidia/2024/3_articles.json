        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "On Monday, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang took the wraps off of the company\u2019s highly anticipated Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU) at the company\u2019s annual GTC conference in San Jose, Calif.\nThe Blackwell is the successor to Nvidia\u2019s already highly coveted H100 and H200 GPUs, and according to the company, it is the world\u2019s most powerful chip. The H100 and H200 chips have become the go-to GPUs for AI applications, helping to rocket Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue over the last few quarters.\nIn its latest quarter alone, the company reported data center revenue of $18.4 billion. To put the segment\u2019s growth into perspective, Nvidia reported annual revenue of $27 billion for all of 2022.\n\u201cFor three decades we\u2019ve pursued accelerated computing with the goal of enabling transformative breakthroughs like deep learning and AI,\u201d Huang said in a statement.\n\u201cGenerative AI is the defining technology of our time. Blackwell GPUs are the engine to power this new industrial revolution. Working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry.\u201d\nLike its prior Hopper GPUs, the Blackwell GPU will be available as a standalone GPU, or two Blackwell GPUs can be combined and paired with Nvidia\u2019s Grace central processing unit to create what it calls its GB200 Superchip.\nThat setup, the company says, will offer up to a 30x performance increase compared to the Nvidia H100 GPU for large language model inference workloads while using up to 25x less energy. That energy savings is an important part of the story.\nNvidia customers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), are currently using or actively developing their own in-house AI chips as alternatives to Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Part of the reason for that is so that they don\u2019t have to pay the tens of thousands of dollars Nvidia\u2019s chips are estimated to cost. But the other reason is that Nvidia\u2019s chips are especially power-hungry.\nBy talking up its energy savings with the Grace Blackwell Superchip, Nvidia is speaking directly to its customers\u2019 concerns.\nNvidia says Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle (ORCL) will be among the first companies to start offering access to Blackwell chips through their cloud platforms.\nIn addition to the Blackwell and Grace Blackwell chips, Nvidia also debuted its DGX SuperPOD supercomputer system. The DGX SuperPOD is made up of eight or more DGX Grace Blackwell 200 (GB200) systems, which include 36 Grace Blackwell 200 Superchips paired to run as a single computer. Nvidia says customers can scale up the SuperPOD to support tens of thousands of GB200 Superchips depending on their needs.\nThe DGX SuperPOD also gets a new liquid-cooled rack-scale architecture, which means the system is cooled off using fluid circulating through a series of pipes and radiators rather than straight-up fan-based air cooling, which can be less efficient and more energy intensive.\nThe Blackwell GPU and GB200 Superchip will be Nvidia\u2019s new top-of-the-line leaders when it comes to AI training and inferencing, which means they\u2019ll be in high demand the moment they hit the market.\nBut competitors AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) aren\u2019t sitting idly by; they are almost certainly working on their own chips with the hopes of eventually catching Nvidia.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become a candidate to overtake Microsoft and Apple as the largest company in the world. After starting 2023 being valued at around a $350 billion market cap, Nvidia is now worth about $2.2 trillion.\nThat's a dramatic expansion in value and it puts it within striking distance of Microsoft and Apple, which are valued at around $3.1 trillion and $2.6 trillion, respectively. It's still a sizable gap to close, but it may happen sooner than you think if the right circumstances occur.\nNvidia is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, as it provides the computing power necessary to make these models work. Its primary product, the GPU (graphics processing unit), excels at crunching through arduous workloads. GPUs are connected to create powerful supercomputers, which often have over 1,000 GPUs.\nWith Nvidia's flagship GPU, the H100, rumored to cost about $30,000, there's a lot of potential revenue for Nvidia. When AI demand started to take off during Nvidia's second quarter of 2023 (ending July 30, 2023), that's when its growth really started.\nIn the last three quarters, Nvidia's revenue more than tripled compared to the previous year's results. For the current quarter, which is first quarter of fiscal year 2025, that trend is also expected to continue as management projects $24 billion in revenue -- a 234% projected increase.\nAfter Q1, Nvidia will have harder comparisons. However, if it can maintain its revenue levels in the mid-$20 billion range, it will still post strong growth, as Q2 and Q3 of FY 2024 saw $13.5 billion and $18.1 billion in revenue, respectively.\nBut will that be enough to surpass Apple and Microsoft?\nIf Nvidia can achieve its projection of $24 billion in revenue in Q1 and barely grow quarter over quarter throughout the year to attain $100 billion in revenue for FY 2025, that could set Nvidia up nicely.\nUsing its Q4 profit margin of 55% as a baseline, Nvidia would produce $55 billion in profits. But how does that compare to Microsoft and Apple?\nThe chart below shows the trailing 12-month (TTM) total of each company's net income. So, even if Nvidia achieves $55 billion in annual profit, it would still be far behind Microsoft and Apple.\nFor Nvidia to surpass either company, investors would have to place a significant premium on the stock, reflected in an expensive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Nvidia's P/E ratio is already much higher than that of Microsoft or Apple, as it trades for 77 times earnings versus Microsoft's 38 and Apple's 27.\nIf Nvidia kept its 77 times earnings price tag with $55 billion in profit, it would be valued at $4.24 trillion, easily surpassing Microsoft as the world's largest company. But that isn't likely.\nNvidia's stock is valued at a premium because investors know that this figure will come down as it grows into its newfound business. So, the only way Nvidia will maintain its 77 times earnings premium at the end of this fiscal year is if it continues doubling or tripling its revenue each quarter.\nIf Nvidia does that, it will have earned the title of the world's largest company. This seems a far stretch, considering that many GPU orders have already been placed.\nWill Nvidia overtake Microsoft or Apple in valuation? I'd say it's unlikely. But Nvidia has produced uncommon growth for the last three quarters, and if that trend continues over the next year, it has a shot at capturing the title of the world's largest company.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Any doubts about Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) ability to sustain its red-hot stock market momentum were put to rest last week following the release of the company's fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results (for the quarter ending Jan. 28). The semiconductor giant not only crushed Wall Street's expectations handsomely, but it also guided strongly for the current quarter, suggesting that its artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled growth is here to stay.\nNot surprisingly, Nvidia stock soared impressively following its earnings release. Additionally, analysts have started raising their growth forecasts for the current and the next two fiscal years, suggesting that its outstanding growth is here to stay.\nHowever, a key statement from Nvidia CFO Colette Kress on the company's earnings conference call suggests that it can sustain its terrific growth for a much longer period: \"We estimate in the past year approximately 40% of data center revenue was for AI inference.\"\nLet's dive into the details.\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) shot into the limelight once it was evident that they are playing a mission-critical role in training large language models (LLMs), which form the backbone of popular generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. Multiple cloud service providers have lined up to get their hands on Nvidia's GPUs to train their AI models and bring generative AI services to the market. As a result, Nvidia controls a whopping 90% share of the AI training chip market.\nAs it turns out, the demand for Nvidia's flagship H100 AI GPU is so strong that customers are willing to wait between 36 and 52 weeks to get their hands on this piece of hardware. Nvidia is shoring up its supply capacity to meet that solid demand, and that explains why the company is expected to keep growing at a terrific pace and more than double its revenue by fiscal 2027 as compared to fiscal 2024's reading of $60.9 billion.\nHowever, Kress' comment that 40% of Nvidia's data center revenue is coming from selling chips used for AI inference applications suggests that it could keep up its eye-popping growth for a very long time. That's because AI inference chips are expected to account for the majority of the overall AI chip market. According to technology news and analysis provider TechSpot, inference is expected to account for 45% of the AI chip market, while AI training chips will account for 15% of this space in the future.\nThat's not surprising, as once an AI model is trained using general-purpose computing chips such as graphics cards, which Nvidia sells, it will be put to use to generate results using new data sets. This process of generating results from an already trained AI model is known as inferencing. By 2030, Verified Market Research estimates that the demand for AI inference chips could jump from an estimated $16 billion in 2023 to almost $91 billion in 2030.\nBased on Kress' statement, Nvidia sold $19 billion worth of AI inference chips last year (40% of its total data center revenue of $47.5 billion for the year). That's higher than the $16 billion revenue estimate from Verified Market Research. This means that Nvidia is dominating the AI inference market already, and the potential revenue opportunity bodes well for the company's future.\nIf the AI inference chip market indeed generates $90 billion in revenue as Verified Market Research estimates, then Nvidia's data center revenue could keep growing nicely through the end of the decade and supercharge its overall business.\nWhat's more, Nvidia is taking steps to ensure that it remains the leading player in the AI inference space with a potential move into custom chips, formally known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These chips are specifically designed for AI inference purposes thanks to their computing power and low power consumption. According to third-party estimates, the market for custom chips used for inferencing could jump from an estimated $30 billion in 2023 to $50 billion in 2025.\nIn all, it is easy to see why analysts are forecasting outstanding growth for Nvidia.\nNvidia's earnings and revenue are set to increase rapidly in the coming years. The market should ideally reward Nvidia stock with handsome gains if it can indeed deliver on that front.\nThat's why buying this AI stock right now looks like a no-brainer, especially considering its forward earnings multiple of 33 is currently lower than its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 39. Meanwhile, Nvidia remains extremely cheap when you look at its price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio).\nThe PEG ratio is calculated by dividing a company's P/E ratio by the estimated annual earnings growth it could deliver. As the following chart shows, Nvidia's PEG ratio is way below 1, the reading below which a stock is considered to be undervalued.\nAll this means that investors are still getting a good deal on Nvidia despite its big surge in the past year, and they should consider buying this AI stock hand over fist given the moves it is making to ensure solid growth.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has soared 258% over the past 12 months. The initial hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) centered around OpenAI and its ChatGPT platform, which quickly attracted a $10 billion investment from Microsoft in early 2023.\nHowever, the technology industry quickly realized OpenAI's success wouldn't have been possible without Nvidia's specialized data center chips, which are designed specifically to process AI workloads. As a result, Nvidia experienced a tidal wave of demand -- from the smallest of AI start-ups to the world's largest tech giants.\nNvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) was the hottest piece of AI hardware last year, and it drove the company's data center revenue to $47.5 billion during its fiscal 2024 year (ended Jan. 28). That was a 217% increase from fiscal 2023.\nAs the below chart shows, the data center segment accounted for 78% of Nvidia's total revenue ($60.9 billion) in fiscal 2024. That's a substantial increase from just 12% in fiscal 2017, when the company generated just $830 million in revenue from the data center. Gaming dominated Nvidia's business back then.\nNvidia will ramp up shipments of its new H200 GPU this year, which can inference (ingest live data so AI models can make predictions) twice as fast as the H100, while consuming half the amount of energy. That's a winning combination for data center operators, so demand could be off the charts for the new chip.\nNvidia is now a $2 trillion company, yet despite its surge in value over the past year, its stock isn't necessarily expensive based on forecast earnings per share for its fiscal 2025, which just began. Therefore, it won't be a surprise if Nvidia stock continues to trend higher.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "For the past three decades, Wall Street and investors have been on a never-ending quest to locate the next big investment trend. Some of these trends have completely changed the growth trajectory of the U.S. economy, such as the advent of the internet. For the time being, no innovation is captivating the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like artificial intelligence (AI).\nBroadly speaking, AI involves the use of software and systems to handle tasks that would normally fall to humans. What makes AI so intriguing is machine learning, which is what allows software and systems to grow smarter over time, which can translate into higher proficiency at assigned tasks, or perhaps the learning of new tasks.\nThe reason AI stocks have skyrocketed is because the technology (in theory) has applications across virtually every sector and industry. It's what compelled the analysts at PwC to predict that AI will add close to $16 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030.\nBut make no mistake about it: semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the undeniable face of the artificial intelligence revolution.\nOver the course of a little more than a year, Nvidia has established itself as the infrastructure foundation of AI-accelerated data centers. The company's high-powered A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are staples of enterprise-operated high-compute data centers. According to lofty expectations issued last year by analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia could account for a 90% share of GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers in 2024.\nAnother factor helping Nvidia is that enterprise demand has overwhelmed the supply of its AI GPUs. The law of supply and demand in economics states that if the supply of a good is constrained and demand is high, the price of that good will increase. The simple fact that data center sales growth has increased many multiples faster than Nvidia's cost of revenue demonstrates that the company is enjoying exceptional pricing power on its top-notch GPUs.\nThe potential good news in the current fiscal year -- Nvidia's fiscal 2025 began on Jan. 29, 2024 -- is that GPU production should meaningfully ramp up. Leading chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is sizably increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity (CoWoS). High-bandwidth memory systems are a practical necessity for AI-accelerated data centers, and they're packaged on CoWoS. With this supply chain issue easing, Nvidia should be able to meet the demand of more enterprise customers this year.\nBut in spite of this seemingly perfect scenario, Wall Street's AI darling may be headed for disaster.\nThere is no shortage of reasons why Nvidia could struggle to sustain a market cap in excess of $2 trillion. Just this week I pointed to its historically lofty valuation\u00a0relative to trailing-12-month sales, as well as the tendency of next-big-thing trends to navigate early-stage bubbles, as viable reasons to be skeptical of Nvidia's surging stock.\nBut arguably nothing is scarier than Nvidia's customer concentration.\nPrior to Nvidia reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Feb. 24, Bloomberg and Barclays Research revealed Nvidia's top customers as a percentage of total sales. The company's four largest customers account for 40% of total revenue and include:\nMicrosoft: 15%\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META): 13%\nAmazon: 6.2%\nAlphabet: 5.8%\nCustomer concentration isn't, by itself, an issue. In fact, you can make a solid argument that having some of the world's most influential innovators as your top customers is an advantage for Nvidia.\nThe problem for the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement is that its four largest customers by revenue are actively developing AI chips of their own to complement the Nvidia GPUs they've been purchasing for their high-compute data centers. It's a pretty clear indication that these four companies aim to lessen their reliance on Nvidia's GPUs in subsequent years, or would prefer to completely ditch Nvidia's infrastructure in favor of internally developed technology.\nThe other issue is that even if Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet continue to purchase Nvidia's GPUs, we're more than likely witnessing a peak in orders in 2024.\nFor example, Meta spent almost $27.3 billion on property and equipment last year. The 350,000 H100 GPUs the company is purchasing from Nvidia will come at a cost of up to $10.5 billion. That's a pretty sizable percentage of Meta's annual capital expenditures coming from a single purchase, which almost certainly isn't going to be duplicated in future years. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has noted that his company will have \"around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs\" by the end of 2024. Presumably, Meta's chief is intimating the use of Meta's in-house-developed AI chips along with Nvidia's H100 GPUs.\nThe point being that Nvidia's top customers are either moving away from its GPU technology, or are highly unlikely to sustain their existing order activity beyond the current year. This is a potentially scary scenario for Wall Street's hottest AI stock that's receiving very little attention.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Will Nvidia Be a $3 Trillion Stock by 2025?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) made headlines by increasing from a $350 billion company at the start of 2023 to a $2.2 trillion company now. But with all of Nvidia's success, many investors wonder if this is the peak of the mountain, or if there is more in store.\nThe next great threshold Nvidia has as a stock is crossing the $3 trillion valuation line, something only Apple and Microsoft have done (although Apple sits lower than this point right now). Could Nvidia be a $3 trillion company sometime in 2025? A lot would have to go right.\nOne technological shift investors can point to for Nvidia's astronomical rise: artificial intelligence (AI). Almost every company is developing an AI strategy or rolling out its own AI-powered products. However, creating these models requires extreme computing power.\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are often recognized as the best in class for this task, so Nvidia has seen the lion's share of the GPU demand wave over the past year. This caused Nvidia's revenue to triple in multiple quarters from a year-over-year standpoint. But the problem with great success is that it becomes difficult to compare to the following year.\nBut if Nvidia can maintain (or marginally grow) its current revenue levels, it will still be OK.\nIn Q1 FY 2025 (ending around April 30), management expects revenue of $24 billion, indicating 234% revenue growth from a year ago. AI demand really picked up after Q1 last year, so the more difficult comparisons will begin next quarter. But with Q2 and Q3 revenue coming in at $13.5 billion and $18.1 billion, respectively, Nvidia's growth rates will continue to look healthy if it can maintain a constant revenue stream of $24 billion throughout FY 2025 (ending January 2025).\nWall Street analysts estimate that Nvidia will be able to generate $110 billion in revenue in FY 2025, so we'll use this as the basis of our analysis to see if Nvidia can become a $3 trillion company by 2025.\nWhen companies are profitable like Nvidia, valuing a company by its sales isn't wise. Instead, investors use a company's earnings per share (EPS) to value it. By dividing a company's stock price by its annual EPS, you get the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a relative metric that describes how expensive a stock is.\nNvidia trades for an incredibly expensive 75 times earnings. But that's not a fair assessment, as the market is a forward-looking machine, and it knows Nvidia will grow this year.\nSo if we use that $110 billion revenue estimate and Nvidia's last quarterly profit margin of 56%, we can estimate that Nvidia will produce around $61.6 billion in profits. If we divide its $3 trillion market cap (market cap is the number of shares outstanding for a company times its stock price) by its theoretical profits, we get a valuation of 49 times earnings.\nThat's still an expensive valuation, although it is cheaper than today's levels. If we use FY 2026 estimates of $134 billion, its required valuation premium falls to 40 times earnings, a much more reasonable price.\nSo to answer the question, Nvidia could be worth $3 trillion by 2025 if it hits analyst estimates; it would just be an expensive stock. But Nvidia's stock has rarely been cheap over the past year, and likely won't get much cheaper moving forward, especially if it continues to post strong growth.\nWith Nvidia's growth trajectory, it may be able to pass Apple as the second-largest company by then as well!\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) needs little introduction at this point. The GPU maker dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) era. It's become the third-most-valuable company in the world behind only Microsoft and Apple, and its revenue more than tripled in its most recent quarter, driving even faster growth on the bottom line.\nNvidia stock jumped more than 500% since the start of 2023. But with its gains accelerating in the first few months of 2024, a new narrative has emerged around the stock, and with it, some pernicious myths. Some investors now believe the stock is in a bubble that will soon collapse, believing that the stock has run too high, too fast and that its profits aren't sustainable.\nHowever, many of the arguments that form that thesis fall apart upon closer examination. Keep reading to see three such talking points that investors should be skeptical of.\nThere's been no shortage of comparisons between the AI boom and the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, and many tech CEOs have likened the disruptive potential of AI to the early days of the internet. Of the famous busts from that era, Cisco Systems\u00a0sticks out as an analogue for Nvidia. Like Nvidia, Cisco was seen as the picks-and-shovels play of that period, selling routers and switches that were essential for internet connectivity.\nHowever, there seem to be more differences than similarities between Nvidia now and Cisco then. Nvidia's competitive advantages are more entrenched than Cisco's were, and it's been building its empire for far longer. Nvidia invented the GPU in 1999 and has been far and away the leader in the category since. It's also built an ecosystem to complement its GPU hardware family, which centers around CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a parallel computing platform it created in 2006 that enables general-purpose computing on Nvidia's GPUs. CUDA essentially functions as a software layer on top of its hardware. While Cisco was just a seller of hardware, Nvidia is selling an entire tech ecosystem.\nNvidia is also growing much faster than Cisco ever was during the dot-com boom. In fact, Cisco's earnings per share only increased 140% total from 1996 to 2000, about 25% annually, rising from $0.15 to $0.36 due in part to excessive share-based compensation. Additionally, Cisco's margins actually declined during that period.\nNvidia, on the other hand, reported a 588% increase in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share in fiscal 2024, outpacing the stock's gains; its margins exploded, and its share count fell over the year.\nOverall, Nvidia is a much stronger company than Cisco was during the dot-com boom, and Nvidia stock hasn't gained nearly as much as Cisco did.\nAnother core tenet of the Nvidia bear thesis is that competition will level the playing field in AI. While it's true that AI GPU competition is already arriving in the form of products like Advanced Micro Devices' MI300 and Intel's\u00a0Gaudi3, AI components are not a commodity product, and this won't be a race to the bottom.\nBecause of assets like CUDA and libraries of prebuilt code on its Superchips, Nvidia's product line is more than just hardware. Those components effectively lock in vendors and provide a suite of tools for customers that is difficult for competitors to match.\nWhile competing products are likely to alleviate the current shortage of GPUs and could weigh on Nvidia's pricing, investors should also remember that the AI market continues to expand and there are new frontiers for Nvidia to penetrate.\nFor example, the company launched an AI PC chip in January, opening up a market that it previously hadn't contested. If Nvidia bears believe AMD and Intel will swipe market share in data center GPUs, which Nvidia currently dominates, they should also consider the prospects of Nvidia turning the tables on its rivals in PCs, their traditional bastion.\nMeanwhile, the market for edge computing AI chips, meaning in end-user devices, is also up for grabs, giving Nvidia a key growth opportunity there as well.\nCompetition is coming, but Nvidia's competitive moat is formidable, and it can penetrate new AI markets as well.\nIn order for Nvidia stock to be in a bubble, it has to be overvalued. By definition, a bubble means that the price of an asset has risen unsustainably because of momentum rather than fundamentals.\nNvidia's fundamentals, on the other hand, look rock-solid. As noted above, the company's GAAP profits jumped by nearly 7 times last year, and Wall Street consistently underestimated the company's growth along the way.\nIts valuation also doesn't seem irrational. The stock trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of around 75, and analysts expect earnings per share to nearly double this year, giving it a forward P/E of less than 40. Nvidia could easily top that forecast as well.\nBased on the company's expected growth rate and its manifest competitive advantages, that valuation seems reasonable. While the stock would certainly fall if it missed estimates, a full-on collapse based on those ratios seems unlikely.\nThere's still a lot of uncertainty in the developing AI market, but there's also huge potential growth even for market leaders like Nvidia.\nNvidia stock has been on fire in recent months, and the stock could certainly undergo a significant correction if its results disappoint or the AI revolution doesn't live up to expectations.\nHowever, based on its current valuation, the competitive landscape, and the strength of the business, the stock is considerably safer than the naysayers claim, and over the long term, Nvidia's prospects continue to look bright as AI applications proliferate to areas like autonomous vehicles. And Nvidia's chips are likely to play a role in emerging technologies.\nWhile it's difficult to predict the short-term movements of any stock, Nvidia still looks like a long-term winner despite claims of an AI stock bubble.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "One of the leaders of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services is surging along with interest in generative AI.\nShares of Nvidia have soared 280% over the last year. Given the unrelenting momentum pushing the stock higher, some investors might be wondering if it's time to take some profits.\nLet's dig into the full story surrounding Nvidia to determine if trimming your position makes sense.\nLast year was a milestone for Nvidia. The company increased its revenue by 126%, all while expanding its margins and increasing cash flow sixfold. With such a dominant performance and an optimistic outlook, it's not surprising that investors have poured into the stock. And to add some color here, Nvidia has added $1 trillion of market cap to its valuation in less than two months.\nThat is a rise of epic proportions. Nvidia is now the world's third-most-valuable company, sitting behind only Microsoft and Apple.\nThe recent momentum pushing shares higher is likely causing some investors to consider taking profits. I don't blame them, but as an investor in Nvidia myself, I'm going to share why I see even better days ahead.\nInvestors should realize that the majority of Nvidia's growth last year stemmed from its computing and networking business. But outside of GPUs and data center services, it has loads of opportunity.\nThe company ended 2023 with $26 billion in cash on the balance sheet, double what it had at the end of 2022. Over the last several months, it has been aggressively investing in new areas in AI that it can use to complement its hardware operation.\nSpecifically, Nvidia invested in two different software businesses: voice-recognition company SoundHound AI, and big data analytics start-up Databricks. I see these as particularly savvy moves. AI-powered voice control is an area where many of Nvidia's big tech cohorts have demonstrated an interest.\nApple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft have all invested in this technology and deployed it across their respective lines of smart-home and personal-computing products. Considering that the addressable market for voice-recognition applications is expected to reach $50 billion by the end of the decade, Nvidia's moves in this lesser-known pocket of AI are understandable.\nAnother area where Nvidia is investing is robotics. The company recently joined Microsoft, Intel, and OpenAI in a funding round for Figure AI, which is developing humanoid robots that it plans to commercialize in manufacturing, warehousing, and retailing.\nGoldman Sachs estimates that humanoid robotics could be a $38 billion market by 2035. Nvidia's GPU hardware coupled with its fast-growing software services business puts the company in a unique position to help move Figure AI's ambitions further along in more ways than one.\nAll of the investments outlined above tell me one thing: Nvidia's journey isn't over. The company is planning for the future and is not sitting on its hardware cash cow.\nThis is why I am optimistic about the company. Yes, the stock has gone parabolic, and many investors are likely up a significant amount of money. But selling a stock simply because the price changed isn't sound financial judgment, it's emotional.\nI understand that taking some profits is tempting at the moment. There are a lot of unknowns regarding AI -- like emerging developers and potential regulatory actions. Also, the moves that the Federal Reserve will or won't make this year are a mystery at best, and this can add to market volatility in the short term.\nBut investors should be thinking about the long-term implications here. The artificial intelligence (AI) narrative is just beginning, and it would behoove investors to continue monitoring the next several chapters of the story. For these reasons, I would continue holding Nvidia as it remains one of the strongest opportunities in AI at the moment.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has emerged as the hottest player in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) are the most important hardware element of the servers that run advanced AI applications.\nIn the particularly high-margin category of GPUs tailored to run AI and other accelerated computing applications, Nvidia currently commands roughly 90% of the market. While competitors, including Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, are making moves to ramp up their capabilities in the ultra-high-performance GPU space, many analysts expect Nvidia to retain its incredible strength in the category.\nWith incredible performances behind it and management guiding for further explosive growth, Nvidia stock has risen by 240% over the last year and is up 82% so far in 2024.\nThese gains have pushed Nvidia's market cap to roughly $2.27 trillion. It now ranks as the world's third-most valuable company and the third-most valuable member of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Apple, currently sitting in second place, has a market cap of $2.65 trillion, while top dog Microsoft is valued at approximately $3.12 trillion.\nCould Nvidia soon be the world's most valuable company?\nStarting late in 2022, incredible leaps forward in artificial intelligence technologies began to emerge at a rapid pace. That progress ramped up dramatically in 2023, and it has shown no sign of slowing down this year.\nAs businesses and institutions have made moves to gain exposure to the AI space, demand has soared for Nvidia's most advanced processors. Its sales and earnings have shot through the roof.\nIn last year's fourth quarter, the company's sales grew 265% year over year to $22.16 billion. Thanks to dramatic performance acceleration in 2023's second half, Nvidia's annual sales increased by 126% to $60.9 billion.\nNvidia posted $29.76 billion in net income last year -- equal to 49% of its total sales. That's an incredible net income margin for a hardware-oriented business; those often have lower margins compared to software-oriented businesses due to the higher incremental costs associated with producing physical goods.\nBut the company's incredible margins reflect just how highly in demand its GPUs are right now. It's reasonable to expect that Nvidia's incredible growth will moderate, but the business looks poised to grow at a much faster rate than Apple and Microsoft for the next few years at least.\nApple and Microsoft still generate far more revenue and net income than Nvidia. On the other hand, the chip powerhouse looks well positioned to continue being the biggest winner in the AI revolution, and has been growing at a far faster rate than those larger tech giants.\nFor comparison, Microsoft\u00a0 grew its sales roughly by 10% over the trailing-12-month period and increased its net income by 20%. Meanwhile, Apple's revenue was flat across that stretch, though its net income rose by 7%.\nIf demand for AI services continues to rise dramatically, there's a good chance that Nvidia will surpass Apple's market cap and take the title of world's most valuable company from Microsoft within the next five years. While the GPU leader's business has historically been shaped by cyclical trends, it still appears to be in the early stages of benefiting from the unfolding AI revolution.\nRight now, Nvidia is benefiting from the emergence of an unprecedented new technology -- and that means forecasting its performance over the next five years involves a heavy dose of speculation. But given its incredible sales and earnings momentum and the overall market excitement for artificial intelligence applications, it wouldn't be shocking to see Nvidia claim the title of world's most valuable business.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "GPU giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) officially unveiled its latest AI chip on Monday built on the new Blackwell architecture. The chip links together two GPUs to provide a big performance boost over Nvidia's current-generation offerings, with architectural improvements delivering some performance and efficiency gains as well.\nWhile Nvidia faces an ever-expanding cadre of competitors, including Advanced Micro Devices and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), it will be difficult for anyone to catch up with Nvidia in terms of raw AI computing power anytime soon.\nIntel plans to launch its third-generation Gaudi AI accelerator this year, but there's little chance the company will catch up with Nvidia in terms of AI training performance. However, buried in Nvidia's announcement was a piece of good news for Intel's nascent foundry business.\nNvidia is using a custom version of the 4NP process node from Taiwan Semiconductor\u00a0(NYSE: TSM), or TSMC. The 4NP node was announced way back in 2021 as the third iteration of TSMC's 5nm-class process nodes. Nvidia's current-generation Hopper architecture is built on a custom version of the TSMC 4N process, which preceded 4NP.\nThe notable thing here is that the 4NP node is not the most advanced node offered by TSMC. Apple currently uses TSMC's 3nm-class nodes for its custom chips. It was widely assumed prior to Nvidia's unveiling that Blackwell would adopt the 3nm-class nodes as well.\nBut Blackwell will instead use a refined version of the manufacturing process used for Hopper. This choice by Nvidia suggests that the reported challenges TSMC has been facing with its 3nm nodes are big and persistent enough to force one of its biggest customers to use a less advanced process.\nReports over the past few years have painted a picture of struggle for TSMC as rolled out its 3nm-class nodes. A problem with low yields was reported in early 2022. About a year later, it was reported that TSMC was struggling to meet demand from Apple due to continuing yield and tool issues. In late 2023, a report suggested that production was increasing but that TSMC would likely fail to meet demand for customers outside of Apple.\nTSMC's struggles come as Intel is ramping up its own foundry operations. Intel is aiming to become the second-largest foundry by 2030, and a big part of the plan hinges on the Intel 18A process. Set to be ready for production by the start of 2025, Intel expects this process to surpass TSMC's 2nm process, which is expected to enter volume production sometime after Intel 18A.\nIf TSMC faces similar struggles with its 2nm process, only able to deliver enough capacity for Apple, Intel could have an opening to score a major coup as other chip designers look for alternatives. Microsoft has already chosen Intel 18A for an undisclosed custom chip, and others may follow if Intel doesn't face any delays.\nIntel has one important trick up its sleeve: Backside power delivery. This technology shifts the interconnects for power delivery in a way that enables a boost in performance or greater power efficiency. Intel 18A will feature backside power delivery, while TSMC isn't expected to implement the technology until sometime in 2026.\nIntel's foundry growth story will play out over many years. It takes time for customer wins to translate into revenue, and Intel 18A isn't even out the door yet. Intel also has a spotty manufacturing track record after facing long delays in the past. But with TSMC having trouble scaling up production, likely forcing Nvidia to stick with less-advanced process nodes, Intel will have an opportunity over the next few years to score some major market share gains.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Nvidia earned its $2.2 trillion market cap by producing artificial-intelligence chips that have become the lifeblood powering the new era of generative AI developers from startups to Microsoft, OpenAI and Google parent Alphabet.\nAlmost as important to its hardware is the company's nearly 20 years' worth of computer code, which helps make competition with the company nearly impossible. More than 4 million global developers rely on Nvidia's CUDA software platform to build AI and other apps.\nNow a coalition of tech companies that includes Qualcomm, Google and Intel plans to loosen Nvidia\u2019s chokehold by going after the chip giant\u2019s secret weapon: the software that keeps developers tied to Nvidia chips. They are part of an expanding group of financiers and companies hacking away at Nvidia's dominance in AI.\n\"We're actually showing developers how you migrate out from an Nvidia platform,\" Vinesh Sukumar, Qualcomm's head of AI and machine learning, said in an interview with Reuters.\nStarting with a piece of technology developed by Intel called OneAPI, the UXL Foundation, a consortium of tech companies, plans to build a suite of software and tools that will be able to power multiple types of AI accelerator chips, executives involved with the group told Reuters. The open-source project aims to make computer code run on any machine, regardless of what chip and hardware powers it.\n\"It's about specifically - in the context of machine learning frameworks - how do we create an open ecosystem, and promote productivity and choice in hardware,\" Google's director and chief technologist of high-performance computing, Bill Magro, told Reuters in an interview. Google is one of the founding members of UXL and helps determine the technical direction of the project, Magro said.\nUXL's technical steering committee is preparing to nail down technical specifications in the first half of this year. Engineers plan to refine the technical details to a \"mature\" state by the end of the year, executives said. These executives stressed the need to build a solid foundation to include contributions from multiple companies that can also be deployed on any chip or hardware.\nBeyond the initial companies involved, UXL will court cloud-computing companies such as Amazon.com and Microsoft's Azure, as well as additional chipmakers.\nSince its launch in September, UXL has already begun to receive technical contributions from third parties that include foundation members and outsiders keen on using the open-source technology, the executives involved said. Intel's OneAPI is already useable, and the second step is to create a standard programming model of computing designed for AI.\nUXL plans to put its resources toward addressing the most pressing computing problems dominated by a few chipmakers, such as the latest AI apps and high-performance computing applications. Those early plans feed in to the organization's longer-term goal of winning over a critical mass of developers to its platform.\nUXL eventually aims to support Nvidia hardware and code, in the long run.\nWhen asked about the open source and venture-funded software efforts to break Nvidia\u2019s AI dominance, Nvidia executive Ian Buck said in a statement: \"The world is getting accelerated. New ideas in accelerated computing are coming from all across the ecosystem, and that will help advance AI and the scope of what accelerated computing can achieve.\"\nNvidia shares gained 0.8% to close at $950.02 on Monday.\nNEARLY 100 STARTUPS\nThe UXL Foundation's plans are one of many efforts to chip away at Nvidia's hold on the software that powers AI. Venture financiers and corporate dollars have poured more than $4 billion into 93 separate efforts, according to custom data compiled by PitchBook at Reuters\u2019 request.\nThe interest in unseating Nvidia through a potential weakness in software has ramped up in the last year, and startups aiming to poke holes in the company's leadership gobbled up just over $2 billion in 2023 compared with $580 million from a year ago, according to the data from PitchBook.\nSuccess in the shadow of Nvidia's group on AI data crunching is an achievement that few of the startups will be able to achieve. Nvidia's CUDA is a compelling piece of software on paper, as it is full-featured and is consistently growing both from Nvidia's contributions and the developer community.\n\"But that's not what really matters,\" said Jay Goldberg, chief executive of D2D Advisory, a finance and strategy consulting firm. \"What matters is the fact that people have been using CUDA for 15 years, they built code around it.\"\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Super Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist, According to Wall Street",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the role model for the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company is worth a whopping $2.2 trillion as of this writing, with $1.5 trillion of that value added within the last 12 months alone. Nvidia's recent success boils down to its data center chips designed for processing AI workloads, which continue to attract incredible demand.\nBut despite capturing the lion's share of investors' attention, Nvidia isn't the only opportunity in the semiconductor space. According to The Wall Street Journal, analysts have a consensus overweight (bullish) rating on two other names: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ: ACLS).\nHere's why owning shares of AMD and Axcelis might be a fantastic idea, too.\nAMD's chips power some of the world's most popular consumer electronics, including Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox Series X, and even the infotainment systems in Tesla's electric vehicles. However, investors' attention is now on the data center.\nThe company has begun shipping its latest MI300 lineup of data center chips designed for AI workloads -- hardware that competes with Nvidia's industry-leading H100 graphics processing unit (GPU). The MI300 comes in two configurations: The MI300A combines GPU and CPU hardware to create an accelerated processing unit (APU), whereas the MI300X is a pure GPU.\nThe MI300A was selected by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to power its new El Capitan supercomputer, which is expected to be the fastest in the world when it comes online this year. However, AMD is also experiencing strong commercial demand for the MI300 range from leading data center operators like Oracle, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms.\nThe MI300 will likely send AMD's data center revenue soaring in the next few years. It won't be easy to catch Nvidia in that segment. However, AMD does have a 90% market share in AI-enabled personal computers. Its Ryzen 700 series (Ryzen AI) chips are designed to handle powerful AI workloads on-device, leading to faster response times for the end user because requests aren't traveling back and forth to the data center.\nMillions of computers from leading manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Asus (among others) have already shipped with Ryzen AI chips. In the recent fourth quarter of 2023, Ryzen AI chips sent AMD's Client segment revenue soaring 62% year over year. The company plans to launch a new processor, which is up to three times faster than previous iterations, so this business is just getting warmed up.\nCombined with a forecast $3.5 billion revenue contribution from the MI300 series in their first full year of sales, 2024 is set to be AMD's biggest year yet. It's no surprise that the majority of the 50 analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal have given AMD stock the highest possible buy rating.\nAxcelis Technologies isn't a glamorous producer of GPUs like Nvidia or AMD. In fact, it's relatively overlooked, with The Wall Street Journal tracking just eight analysts who cover its stock. Nevertheless, the majority of them have given it the highest possible buy rating, and it trades at a very attractive valuation right now, which might entice investors to follow the Street's lead.\nAxcelis manufactures ion implantation equipment, which is critical to the chip fabrication process. Producers of silicon carbide power devices -- which regulate electric power in workloads with high currents -- are a significant source of demand for Axcelis at the moment, thanks especially to the electric vehicle industry. Silicon carbide chemistry is more efficient than traditional silicon chemistry, which leads to more mileage per battery charge and faster charging times.\nThe company is also preparing for growing demand from producers of AI-related semiconductors. Last year, the company noted that AI requires significantly more memory and storage capacity, which could make DRAM and NAND chips more complex to manufacture, and more expensive.\nAxcelis generated a record $1.13 billion in revenue during 2023, representing a 22.9% year-over-year increase. But here's the kicker: The company ended 2023 with an order backlog worth $1.2 billion, so 2024 is shaping up to be another record year.\nThe stock is up over 400% in the last five years, but it has taken a breather over the last few months, suffering a 44% decline from its all-time high. That might spell opportunity, because based on the company's $7.43 in earnings per share in 2023, the stock now trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.6. That's a 59% discount to the 35.6 P/E ratio of the iShares Semiconductor ETF, so Axcelis' stock is substantially cheaper than the rest of the chip industry, on average.\nMoreover, when you also consider Wall Street's bullish stance on Axcelis stock, there is a very clear case for buying it right now.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA surpassed the $2 trillion market capitalization last Friday as it continues to benefit from the robust demand for its next-generation chips for artificial intelligence models. This makes the graphic processing unit (GPU) maker the third publicly traded U.S. company, following Microsoft and Apple, which have a valuation of more than $2 trillion as of Mar 1.\nIt took NVIDIA around nine months to attain the $2 trillion milestone from the $1 trillion market capitalization as of Jun 14, 2023. The share price momentum, which started at the beginning of 2023 with NVDA stock soaring 239% in the year, has continued in 2024. Year to date, shares of the company have surged 66.1%.\nNVIDIA\u2019s remarkable share price run is primarily attributable to investors\u2019 hopes that this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company will be a prime beneficiary of growing investments in generative AI. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\nThough AI has been around for years, the meteoric rise of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT has captivated the world\u2019s attention on the power of generative AI to augment human capability, suggesting that the AI boom may just get started.\nThe growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $66.62 billion in 2024 and $207 billion in 2030, according to a new report by statista. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 20.8% from 2024 to 2030.\nThe adoption of ChatGPT among enterprises has already proven generative AI technology\u2019s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.\nThe proven success of generative AI has sparked competition among software makers, including Salesforce CRM, Cisco CSCO and Adobe ADBE, to integrate the technology into their products. However, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\nNVIDIA\u2019s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. The company\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, had previously stated that existing data centers are insufficiently equipped to handle growing AI workloads.\nNVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are already being applied in AI models, which is expanding its footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing. The generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. NVIDIA expects its first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues to reach $24 billion from $7.19 billion in the year-ago quarter, largely driven by surging AI investments across the data center end market.\nSalesforce forayed into the generative AI space with the launch of Einstein GPT in March 2023. Later, in 2023, the company elevated the set of its generative AI tools with the launch of the AI Cloud service. With this, the company claims to offer one-stop AI-powered solutions for enterprises looking to enhance productivity.\nSalesforce\u2019s AI Cloud is a suite of services that delivers enterprise-ready real-time, open and secure generative experiences across all applications and workflows. The suite powers new capabilities across Salesforce\u2019s products, including Einstein service, data analysis software Tableau and workplace-messaging app, Slack.\nCisco\u2019s AI and machine learning offerings encompass a wide range of computing solutions for enterprises, including a focus on cybersecurity. The company plans to enhance customer experience solutions, devices and its video conferencing platform, Webex Suite, with machine learning technologies, automation and generative AI features from meeting summaries to visual enhancements.\nThe digital media solutions provider, Adobe, aggressively expanded its footprint in the generative AI space through partnerships and new solutions. Adobe has unveiled a family of generative AI models, Firefly, focused on the generation of texts and images. Per the company, Firefly offers more precision, speed, power and ease in content creation. It lets users of various experience levels create high-quality images and stunning text effects.\nAt present, Salesforce and Adobe each carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Cisco has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of CRM have rallied 20.4% year to date, while CSCO and ADBE have declined 4.2% and 4.3%, respectively.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Board members at Nvidia\u2014 the AI company no one can stop talking about that is at the forefront of the tech evolution\u2014are reaping the benefits of a runup in the company\u2019s stock. Shares in the company traded at $887 today, up 26.5% this month alone.\nFour insiders sold holdings via multiple transactions in the past four weeks, SEC filings show. They joined a growing list of executives who have unloaded billions in company stock in recent months. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon logged his first-ever stock sale last month to the tune of $150 million, while Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sold $8.5 billion in Amazon stock. Meta Platforms founder Mark Zuckerberg sold $1.2 billion and private equity founder Leon Black made his first-ever sale worth $172.8 million.\nOn the Nvidia board, Tench Coxe, former managing director at venture capital investment firm Sutter Hill Ventures, sold $170 million in company stock in three transactions yesterday. As a director, Coxe earns restricted stock valued at $255,000 annually and $85,000 in cash. Coxe has been an Nvidia board member since 1993.\nSimilarly, board member Mark Stevens offloaded 12,000 shares of stock worth $10.2 million this week after shedding 15,000 shares last month, worth about $12 million. Stevens is managing partner at private family office investment firm S-Cubed Capital and was previously a partner at VC investment company Sequoia Capital. Stevens was a director from 1993 to 2006 and rejoined the board in 2008. Stevens previously sold 36,000 shares in January when the stock was about $546 for about $19.7 million.\nAnother board member, Mark Perry, sold 15,000 shares for about $11.9 million on Feb. 23, just two days after the company reported earnings on Feb. 21. Perry has been a director for nearly a decade and is a consultant for nonprofits and former CEO at biopharmaceutical company Aerovance.\nHarvey Jones, a longtime director who also joined the board in 1993, carved off a portion of his stake in the company for about $53 million. Jones is managing partner of Square Wave Ventures.\nDespite their sales, Coxe, Jones, Stevens and Perry still have significant stakes in the AI chip developer. Coxe holds around 4.1 million shares, Jones holds nearly a million shares, Perry holds 152,000 and Stevens holds 4.4 million shares. CEO Jensen Huang holds about 86 million shares in the company, a 3.5% stake.\nMeanwhile, Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy sold 50,000 shares in Amazon this week for about $9 million. His sale was made as part of a trading plan set up in advance.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "While Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) AI-fueled rally may not be over, it becomes increasingly difficult to justify buying the stock as the GPU maker's valuation soars. With a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion as of midday Wednesday, the stock requires investors to ignore the myriad threats that could unravel the company's dominance of the AI chip market.\nThe biggest advantage Nvidia has comes from software. CUDA is Nvidia's software toolkit for developing applications that can be accelerated by its GPUs. CUDA has been around for 16 years and has become the de facto standard. As the AI boom got underway, the path of least resistance was Nvidia GPUs and CUDA-powered software.\nWhile there are alternatives to CUDA, there's a tremendous amount of inertia keeping Nvidia's dominance intact. Without this software advantage, competing AI chips from AMD, Intel, and others would be having an easier time winning market share.\nNvidia recently updated its end-user license agreement for CUDA to explicitly disallow translation layers that enable CUDA-based software to run on non-Nvidia hardware. The company is clearly worried about competition chipping away at its dominant market position. The end of CUDA's dominance would be a boon for any company that buys AI accelerators, and it's likely to happen sooner or later as AI companies seek alternatives.\nWhile Nvidia's competitive advantages will likely erode over time as competition heats up, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) is positioning itself to be the go-to platform for AI among large enterprises and organizations. The company's watsonx AI platform, which gets its name from the Watson AI supercomputer that won Jeopardy! in 2011, is aimed at the type of customers that can't throw caution to the wind as they adopt AI technology.\nThe watsonx platform enables enterprises to train, validate, and deploy AI models while keeping an eye on compliance, risk management, and governance issues. Companies that operate in highly regulated industries must follow strict rules regarding their data, and no company wants a customer-facing AI chatbot to go off the rails. IBM's watsonx platform provides guardrails for enterprises deploying AI.\nBeyond general use cases, watsonx has some specific capabilities that can drive adoption. IBM's mainframe systems, which have been at the heart of some industries for decades, run billions of lines of sensitive, mission-critical code written in an ancient programming language called COBOL. As the number of developers capable of writing and maintaining COBOL code declines, IBM's mainframe customers are put in a bind.\nThis is where the watsonx Code Assistant comes into play. One application for this product is modernizing COBOL code by transforming it into Java code. This process must be done with care because much of this code is highly sensitive -- think software that processes transactions at major financial institutions. This functionality will not only drive customers to adopt the watsonx platform but also strengthen the mainframe business by making it much easier to modernize applications.\nIBM stock has rallied over the past year, gaining about 50% in that time. Optimism about the company's AI prospects along with a string of solid results are the likely culprits behind the surge.\nEven as IBM stock closes in on its all-time high, the stock remains a great value for investors. The company expects to generate free cash flow of about $12 billion this year, which puts the price-to-free cash flow ratio at 15. For comparison, other large tech companies trade at significantly higher multiples of free cash flow.\nAI is just a piece of what IBM does, but it's likely to be a key growth driver in the years ahead. The stock isn't nearly as cheap as it once was, but it's still an attractive investment for those looking to tap into the AI boom without taking on excessive levels of risk.\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been on top of the world over the last year as it has cornered the market on artificial intelligence (AI) chips, with its stock up more than 247% since last March.\nAs demand for AI services soared, so has the need for graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the chips necessary for training and running AI models. Meanwhile, Nvidia has held a leading market share in GPUs for years, perfectly positioning it to immediately begin supplying its chips to AI developers everywhere.\nConsequently, Nvidia's earnings have skyrocketed as it achieved a majority market share in the AI GPU market while competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have scrambled to catch up.\nNvidia's meteoric rise has some analysts questioning how much room the company has left to run. However, its stock keeps defying expectations, rising 20% in the last month alone. Given the massive potential of AI and Nvidia's position in the market, I wouldn't bet against it over the long term.\nSo, here are two reasons to buy Nvidia stock like there's no tomorrow.\nThe launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 reignited interest in AI and highlighted just how far the technology had come. Companies from countless industries began pivoting their businesses toward the budding arena as it became clear that AI could bolster a wide variety of businesses, from consumer tech to autonomous vehicles, e-commerce, cloud computing, and more.\nData from Grand View Research shows the AI market hit close to $200 billion last year and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. For reference, that projection would see the industry reach nearly $2 trillion by the end of the decade. As a result, there seems to be no end in sight to the soaring demand for AI GPUs.\nMeanwhile, last year, Nvidia's head start in the market saw it achieve an estimated 90% market share in AI chips, leading to soaring earnings.\nIn its most recent quarter (the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. This monster growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales.\nAdditionally, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion. So, despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed the company further ahead, providing it with more significant cash reserves to continue investing in technology and retain market supremacy.\nLast year, Nvidia became the first chipmaker to achieve a market cap above $1 trillion. In fact, its market cap is currently more than $2 trillion, with Nvidia the world's third most valuable company, only after Microsoft and Apple.\nNvidia has come a long way in a short time. Yet its stock has actually increased in value over the last 12 months.\nThe chart above shows that Nvidia's price-to-free-cash-flow and price-to-earnings ratios plunged in the last year, indicating its stock is at one of its best-valued positions in 12 months.\nP/E is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share. Meanwhile, the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio divides its market cap by free cash flow. These are helpful valuation metrics as they take into account a company's financial health. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value.\nThis, in addition to Nvidia's potent position in a burgeoning industry and significant cash reserves, makes the company's stock worth considering right now for a long-term investment.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "You know those far-fetched headlines asking if a stock can go to $10,000 by 2025, but it\u2019s only trading at $1,000? It is pure silliness. However, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock could be the exception.\nAs I write this, Nvidia\u2019s share price is $904, up 14% for the month, 107% for six months, 234% for the past 52 weeks, and 1,912% over the last year. From its October 2022 low of around $112, it\u2019s up 707% in 18 months.\nTo reach $10,000 by the end of 2025, Nvidia must generate a compound annual growth rate of nearly 300%. It seems outlandish and probably is, but if the company continues to deliver AI-fueled growth in 2024 and 2025, I\u2019m not sure investors can count it out.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nI mean, look at Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST). Over the past 30 years, its shares have appreciated by around 200,000%, a CAGR of nearly 29%.\nNow, beverages might not have cyclical corrections like chip companies, but they also don\u2019t have the kind of rocket-fueled growth that chip companies experience, especially when we\u2019re talking about life-altering technology like generative AI.\nI don\u2019t think it can reach $10,000 by 2025. But if it did, here\u2019s how it would do so.\nNvidia trades at a multiple of nearly 75 times its trailing 12-month earnings and 35.6 times its forward earnings.\nThe latter is actually below its five-year average of 39.3x. At the same time, its price-to-sales ratio is 36.6x, while its five-year average is 18.2x.\nIts PEG ratio, at 1.55, suggests that it is undervalued, considerably lower than its five-year average of 2.44.\nFor those unfamiliar with the PEG ratio, it is P/E (current price divided by EPS estimate for the current fiscal year) divided by its projected 5-year EPS growth rate.\nAs Motley Fool contributor David Jagielski pointed out in February, Nvidia\u2019s EPS growth rate projection is very bullish for Nvidia. Any unexpected slowdown in AI would put a major dent in the PEG ratio.\nIn a January article, Jagielski quotes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman from his appearance at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.\n\u201cIt will change the world much less than we all think and it will change jobs much less than we all think,\u201d Altman said.\nInvestors are faced with a dilemma. Buy into the AI hype, and face crippling losses as NVDA stock returns to more historical levels below $400.\u00a0 Before June 2023, it had never traded above $400.\nThe only way Nvidia will get to $10,000 by the end of 2025 is if the PEG ratio expands to a five-year average double where it is now.\nNo one understood that AI was a big deal until ChatGPT came out. Then, a light went on in most people\u2019s heads that this technology was a game-changer. That was November 30, 2022. It\u2019s been out there for 16 months.\nIn February 2023, ChatGPT Plus launched for subscribers only. Everyone and their dog is trying to create the next great generative AI app or program.\nThe University of Toronto\u2019s Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society published a commentary on Jan. 31, 2023, called ChatGPT \u201ca game changer for artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\u201cWith more than one million users within the first five days of its launch, followed by news that Microsoft will invest US $10 billion in OpenAI in January 2023, ChatGPT is a transformative development in AI natural language processing,\u201d the institute\u2019s commentary stated.\nOne area that will benefit from ChatGPT and AI is academia. Plenty of university students will use the technology to cheat their way through school. However, there is so much good from the technology.\n\u201cTech\u2019s ability to revolutionize schools has been overhyped in the past, and it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement around ChatGPT\u2019s transformative potential,\u201d stated MIT Technology Review contributor Will Douglas Heaven in April 2023. \u201cBut this feels bigger: AI will be in the classroom one way or another. It\u2019s vital that we get it right.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t know what lies beyond the original generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Claude, Jasper, etc.\nThat could be an even bigger revenue generator than current AI initiatives. Nvidia would surely benefit.\nThe only caveat: It won\u2019t happen soon enough to get NVDA stock to $10,000 by 2025.\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Text": "There's a shortage of high-powered chips capable of training and running advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. Mega-tech companies are battling each other for AI supremacy, scooping up boatloads of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) data center GPUs along the way, and AI start-ups with rocketing valuations are multiplying.\nThere's little question that AI is a revolutionary technology. There's also little question, at least in my mind, that AI is fueling a classic bubble. Start-ups founded less than a year ago, like Mistral AI, are already worth billions. Some publicly traded companies, notably server maker Super Micro Computer, have seen their valuations skyrocket to levels that seem illogical. Caution is increasingly being thrown to the wind.\nNvidia and its GPUs are at the center of it all. Not only are the company's GPUs well suited for the calculations necessary for training and running AI models, but its proprietary CUDA platform has become the de facto standard for accelerated computing over the past 16 years. With companies scrambling to win the AI race, Nvidia's GPUs are the path of least resistance.\nIt's not surprising then that demand for Nvidia's AI accelerators has exploded. The company's data center segment generated $18.4 billion of revenue in its latest quarter, a fivefold increase from the prior-year period. Profits are soaring as well. In the recently completed fiscal 2024, Nvidia earned a net income of $32.3 billion of $60.9 billion of revenue.\nNvidia stock has more than tripled over the past year, pushing up the company's market capitalization beyond $2 trillion.\n\"I've seen gluts not followed by shortages, but I've never seen a shortage not followed by a glut,\" says Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who is regarded as an expert on risk. The inertia behind Nvidia's CUDA has slowed down competitors, but a tsunami of competing AI accelerators is building. Nvidia's incredible profits and pricing power won't survive once supply catches up with demand.\nAdvanced Micro Devices launched new AI-centric data center GPUs late last year. Intel will launch the third generation of its capable Gaudi line of AI accelerators this year. OpenAI's Sam Altman is reportedly seeking vast funding for new semiconductor factories to build AI chips. Cloud giants including Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are designing and installing their own AI chips. The list goes on.\nHere's how the current shortage turns into a glut. First, insatiable demand and extravagant long-term projections drive a wave of competition. This is what's happening now. AMD has predicted that the AI chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. For perspective, global semiconductor sales were just over $500 billion last year.\nSecond, future demand inevitably falls short of these wild projections. AI chip demand can still soar in the coming years and miss expectations, given how optimistic industry players have become. Eventually, this leads to a situation where there's more than enough supply of AI chips.\nAt this point, Nvidia's pricing power would have eroded considerably. CUDA would no longer be dominant as alternatives pop up and gain traction. For big cloud companies, there's a strong incentive to be able to support AI accelerators from a wide variety of suppliers.\nThis isn't the first time Nvidia's stock has soared thanks to a revolutionary technology. The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s pushed up the company's valuation to extreme levels as well. The aftermath was a disaster for shareholders.\nRelative to sales, Nvidia stock is far more expensive today than at any point during the dot-com bubble. \"This time is different,\" you might say. Demand for AI is real, and the company's revenue is soaring. But you've just uttered the four most dangerous words in investing.\nThis time might be different. Or the market dynamics that play out during nearly every shortage of anything will play out once again and grind down Nvidia's pricing power and profits. By investing in Nvidia, you'll likely be paying a high price to relearn the lessons of the dot-com bubble.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been one of the best-performing stocks globally over the past 18 months. The chip manufacturer\u2019s shares are up nearly 7x over the period. This extraordinary growth can certainly turn some investors off, making them believe it\u2019s overvalued. However, it\u2019s worth remembering that momentum can actually be one of the best indicators of forward stock performance, especially if the company has a track record of beating expectations.\nPersonally, I remain bullish on NVDA stock, not just because of momentum but because the company is so central to the AI revolution, which has only just begun.\nNvidia, as a company, is at the very heart of the AI revolution due to its graphics processing units (GPUs), which possess the capabilities required for huge AI and large language models. The units were originally built for the gaming sector, but GPUs are also perfect for AI\u2019s massive data processing needs.\nUnlike central processing units (CPUs) that handle tasks one by one, GPUs excel at parallel processing, allowing them to take on multiple tasks simultaneously. Without this technology, the step forward we\u2019ve seen in AI, which includes developments in facial recognition technology and self-driving cars, wouldn\u2019t be possible.\nNvidia\u2019s dominance stems from the architecture of its GPU. Unlike CPUs with a few cores, Nvidia packs a massive number of cores onto a single chip. In turn, this allows for high processing power within a smaller space, and this is hugely important for efficient AI processing. Moreover, Nvidia has focused on high-bandwidth memory, which allows these cores to access data rapidly, further accelerating AI computations. As such, Nvidia has earned a significant edge in the AI hardware race.\nHowever, in the AI world, it\u2019s not just about hardware. Nvidia\u2019s CUDA software provides direct access to the GPU\u2019s virtual instructions. This software ecosystem empowers developers to build and refine AI projects and has made Nvidia a one-stop shop for all things AI.\nNvidia stock is expensive in that it\u2019s becoming less affordable for many investors. Trading around $900 a share, some investors may struggle to purchase a single Nvidia share as part of a diverse portfolio of holdings. However, from a valuation perspective, I don\u2019t think Nvidia stock is expensive or overpriced. In fact, it may still represent good value.\nNvidia currently trades at 35.4x forward earnings, making it more expensive than the S&P 500 (SPX), but it\u2019s by no means too expensive for the tech sector. Moreover, the company is expected to continue delivering stellar growth throughout the medium term. In fact, Nvidia\u2019s earnings are forecasted to grow by 34.78% annually throughout the medium term.\nThis means that Nvidia\u2019s all-important PEG ratio is 1.02. While 1.0 may be considered the benchmark for fair value, I still think this represents good value, noting long-term trends in the AI industry and the market\u2019s bullishness on U.S. tech.\nIn turn, this means that Nvidia is trading at 29.77x earnings for 2026, 25.26x earnings for 2027, and 21.49x earnings for 2028. Moreover, it\u2019s worth recognizing that Nvidia just keeps on beating analysts\u2019 most bullish forecasts. That\u2019s always a good sign, and maybe it could continue to beat expectations, going forward.\nDue to its enabling position in the AI revolution and its attractive valuation metrics, Nvidia stock earns a Strong Buy from analysts. Currently, Nvidia has 39 Buys, two Hold ratings, and zero Sell ratings. The average Nvidia stock target price is $913.74, inferring 1.1% upside potential. The highest share price target is $1,200, and the lowest share price target is $608.40.\nNvidia has been central to the AI revolution, but there are two important things to consider moving forward: Nvidia\u2019s competitive advantage in the all-important generative AI market and the fact that the AI revolution has only just begun.\nOver the past 18 months, Nvidia has found itself with a formidable moat, which it has successfully built upon. Other companies, including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), have eyes on Nvidia\u2019s crown, but it\u2019s not clear how they will catch up. The Santa Clara-based firm\u2019s new H200 chipset is the must-have for generative AI and large language models. The H200 is thought to be between 1.4 and 1.9 times faster than the H100 when it comes to large language model inference. That\u2019s an impressive jump in just one year.\nMoreover, the market is growing and has the potential to grow much faster. SoftBank\u2019s (OTC:SFTBY) Masayoshi Son is considering a $100 billion venture in the AI chip space, and OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman is reportedly looking for $7 trillion for\u00a0a string of AI chip factories that would respond to burgeoning demand and restructure the world\u2019s semiconductor sector.\nGiven the near-term momentum in the sector, the fact that demand for GPUs still outstrips supply, and the fact that we really are just at the start of the AI revolution, I remain bullish on Nvidia.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) have soared big time since the beginning of 2023, clocking astronomic gains of 441% as the stock market has handsomely rewarded the company's outstanding top- and bottom-line growth, but that tremendous rally has made the stock extremely expensive.\nNvidia stock is currently trading at 41 times sales, significantly higher than its five-year average sales multiple of 17.7. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index has an average price-to-sales ratio of 2.7. Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is also quite expensive at 97. The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index, of which Nvidia is a part, has an average P/E ratio of 34.\nThese valuation multiples indicate that Nvidia isn't exactly a value pick right now. However, that's half the story, as a closer look at Nvidia's forward multiples and its potential growth prospects suggests something else.\nWhile Nvidia does seem expensive as far as its trailing multiples are concerned, the picture changes completely when it comes to the company's forward-looking multiples. The stock sports a forward P/E multiple of 33. That's almost in line with the Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 30, using the index as a proxy for tech stocks.\nGiven Nvidia's leading position in the market for chips used for training artificial intelligence (AI) models -- the driving force behind the company's outstanding performance in the recently concluded fiscal year 2024 -- it is easy to see why its forward earnings multiple is substantially lower. The chipmaker's revenue jumped an impressive 126% in fiscal 2024 (which ended on Jan. 28) to almost $61 billion. Non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings shot up to $12.96 per share from $3.34 per share in the previous year, almost quadrupling in value.\nWorth noting is that Nvidia's growth in the final two quarters of fiscal 2024 was majestic. In Q3, for instance, its revenue was up 206% year over year to $18 billion. That was followed by a 265% year-over-year increase in revenue in the previous quarter to $22.1 billion. The chipmaker anticipates its revenue in the ongoing quarter to come in at $24 billion at the midpoint, which would be a 234% year-over-year increase.\nBut that's not where the good part ends, as analysts are anticipating Nvidia's revenue to increase significantly in the new fiscal year, and beyond.\nAs the chart above indicates, Nvidia's revenue is expected to jump 2.5x in the next three fiscal years from fiscal 2024's reading. That's not surprising, considering the potential growth opportunity in the AI chip market and Nvidia's pole position in this space.\nNvidia management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that its data center revenue shot up a whopping 409% year over year to $18.4 billion and produced 83% of its total revenue thanks to robust demand for \"both training and inference of generative AI and large language models across a broad set of industries, use cases, and regions.\"\nThe company also added that it is witnessing an improvement in the supply of its data center chips. But despite that, it sees demand for its next-generation AI chips to be stronger than supply. That's not surprising, as Nvidia reportedly controls more than 80% of the market for AI chips, and customers have been lining up to get their hands on its offerings for AI training and inference.\nMore importantly, the company is focused on maintaining its leadership position in this lucrative market with its upcoming H200 AI graphics processing unit (GPU). Nvidia will start the initial shipments of this processor in the next quarter and claims that it is already witnessing solid demand for this product.\nWith the AI chip market set to clock annual growth of almost 38% through the end of the decade, generating an annual revenue of $207 billion in 2030, Nvidia is all set to capitalize on this tremendous opportunity thanks to its aggressive product plan. As a result, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia's stock head higher in the future, especially considering the terrific earnings growth it is predicted to deliver.\nNvidia delivered $12.96 per share in earnings in fiscal 2024. As the chart below tells us, analysts have significantly raised their earnings growth expectations.\nIf Nvidia does hit $34.21 per share in earnings in fiscal 2027, as seen in the chart, and maintains its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 39.2 at that time, its stock price could increase to $1,341. That would be a 70% increase from current levels.\nGiven that Nvidia is trading at a lower forward earnings multiple at present, investors are getting a good deal on this AI stock right now, which they should consider grabbing with both hands, as its red-hot rally seems here to stay.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If there was a poster child for the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), there's a strong argument it should be Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock generated blistering gains of 239% in 2023 and was already up 72% so far this year (as of the market close on Monday), regularly notching new all-time highs.\nThe company, best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), has adapted its technology to run AI systems and has essentially cornered the market. Rivals are scrambling to invent a better mousetrap, but thus far, none has been forthcoming.\nThis has investors in a quandary. After clocking 483% gains in roughly 14 months, is Nvidia stock still a buy? Let's dig into the evidence to see what it reveals.\nIt's easy to dismiss Nvidia's recent run as a delightful happenstance, but it was actually years in the making. More than a decade ago, CEO Jensen Huang focused on technology that wasn't discussed much outside academic circles -- AI.\nBack in 2009, researcher Geoffrey Hinton, widely acknowledged as the \"Godfather of AI,\" used Nvidia processors to train a deep learning neural network, laying the ground for much of the AI research that followed. After achieving astonishing results, Hinton sang the praises of Nvidia GPUs to his colleagues, who soon began using the processors for AI, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nSince then, Nvidia has become the gold standard for machine learning, an established branch of AI, controlling an estimated 95% of the market, according to market intelligence company CB Insights (via BBC). This extends to data centers, where much of the AI processing is done, as Nvidia controls a dominant 95% share of that market as well, according to CFRA analyst Angelo Zino.\nBecause Nvidia was so entrenched in the existing AI market, this paved the way for a groundswell of GPU demand when generative AI broke out early last year.\nIt's this rapid and accelerating demand for AI that has supercharged Nvidia's growth. For its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, ended Jan. 28, Nvidia generated record revenue of $22.1 billion, which soared 265% year over year. Profit was also robust, as adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 surged 486%. This marked the third successive quarter of triple-digit year-over-year growth.\nIf that wasn't enough, management expects the company's growth spurt to continue. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter, Nvidia is guiding for record revenue of $24 billion, up 234% year over year and 9% sequentially. This illustrates that the adoption of generative AI continues to accelerate, and there could be more to come.\nI might as well address the elephant in the room, as it encapsulates the debate that rages on Wall Street: Is Nvidia stock simply too expensive? The answer to that question, quite frankly, is \"it depends.\" Investors have their preferences when it comes to valuation metrics, but truth be told, there isn't one that's the be-all and end-all -- and each has its limitations.\nFor example, based on its price-to-earnings ratio of 71, the stock appears wildly expensive, more than double the value of the S&P 500. Furthermore, at 35 times sales, the stock also appears ridiculously expensive, as a reasonable price-to-sales ratio is generally considered to be between 1 and 2. These are the two most commonly used valuation metrics, which would suggest the stock is too expensive.\nUnfortunately, neither of these backward-looking metrics factors in Nvidia's relentless and ongoing triple-digit growth. For that, we turn to the price/earnings-to-growth ratio, which values Nvidia at less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.\nDespite its rapid adoption, it's important to remember that generative AI is still in its infancy. These next-generation AI systems appeared just over a year ago, and the number of use cases is growing exponentially.\nWhile estimates vary wildly regarding the potential size of the AI market, the generative AI market alone could add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion in economic value annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\nIt's unlikely that Nvidia can keep up its relentless pace of growth indefinitely, and the days of easy comps are in the rearview mirror. Furthermore, a rival could create a processor that's better equipped to handle the rigors of AI -- and a host competitors are working to achieve that goal.\nThat said, given Nvidia's entrenched position, the breadth of the opportunity, and reasonable valuation, investors would do well to at least consider owning a piece of this runaway train.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "To say Nvidia (NVDA) is on a hot streak would be an understatement. Shares of the AI darling are up a staggering 267% over the last 12 months and 79% year to date. Tech companies across the world covet its graphics cards like rare jewels and CEO Jensen Huang is as in-demand as some heads of state.\nAnd on Monday, he\u2019ll kick off Nvidia\u2019s annual GTC conference with a two-hour keynote at the SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., outlining what\u2019s ahead for the company in the year ahead. In prior years, Nvidia has used the show to debut some of its biggest products.\nIn 2022, it announced its Hopper graphics architecture and H100 graphics processing unit, which is now the go-to card for companies training and deploying AI models. This year, Nvidia is widely expected to debut Hopper and the H100\u2019s successors, kicking off what could be a new rush on the company\u2019s products.\nThe new architecture, codenamed Blackwell, and GPU, dubbed the B100, are anticipated to offer far better performance when it comes to running models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3. Nvidia isn\u2019t exactly hiding its plans for the B100. During the Supercomputer 2023 conference, the company showed off a slide outlining the GPU\u2019s potential capabilities compared to the H100 and H200 cards.\nIn addition to the Blackwell architecture and B100 card, Nvidia will also likely give attendees and viewers a look at the latest advancements in its CUDA software.\nThe platform, which lets programmers take advantage of a GPU\u2019s processing capabilities for AI and other applications, is an essential part of Nvidia\u2019s overall enterprise strategy and helps lock in developers who build on Nvidia\u2019s software, virtually ensuring they\u2019ll stick with Nvidia\u2019s products in the future.\nNvidia could also announce that it will begin producing its H20 AI chip for the Chinese market. The chip, according to Reuters, is meant to serve as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s more powerful H100 and H200 chips. The US prohibits Nvidia from selling those chips to Chinese customers for fear that the Chinese military and government will use them to develop advanced AI applications to rival the US's.\nThose are the big stories we\u2019ll be watching from GTC, but we\u2019ll also likely get plenty of other announcements and debuts from Nvidia and its partners.\nSome 300 exhibitors are set to take part in the conference and speakers ranging from OpenAI\u2019s COO Brad Lightcap and Meta\u2019s vice president of AI research Joelle Pineau to Microsoft\u2019s vice president of generative AI S\u00e9bastien Bubeck set to make appearances at the show.\nYahoo Finance will be on the ground, bringing you all of the biggest news from the conference and chatting with some of Nvidia\u2019s top executives.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Companies of all sizes are scrambling to invest in artificial intelligence (AI). From data centers, semiconductor chips, cloud computing, and large language models (LLMs), the prospects of generative AI has no bounds.\nAt the center of all the action sits Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). After adding one-trillion dollars of market cap in less than two months, it's clear that investors cannot get enough of Nvidia stock.\nArk Invest CEO and outspoken technology investor Cathie Wood penned a shareholder letter earlier this month outlining why she sees some turbulence ahead for Nvidia. Let's break down Wood's argument and assess the warning signs she's posing.\nIn her shareholder letter, Wood makes an apt comparison between Nvidia and Cisco. During the early days of the internet in the 1990s, Cisco enjoyed an extended moment in the spotlight thanks to the company's breakthroughs in routers and computer hardware equipment.\nUnsurprisingly, investors poured into Cisco stock, eventually propelling Cisco to the world's most-valuable company. Today, Cisco isn't even in the top-50 most-valuable companies measured by market cap.\nOn the surface, I understand the comparison Wood makes. Demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services is abnormally high thanks to urgency-driven investments surrounding the AI narrative.\nWood warns that rising competition could spell trouble for Nvidia, and it could be here sooner than later. While this may be true, I'm not completely sold on this argument. Understanding the underlying details around increased competition is important for investors to explore.\nIn the aftermath of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s, Cisco failed to innovate at the same pace as its competition. As a result, computing hardware became a commoditized product, putting Cisco in somewhat of an existential crisis. While Cisco still operates a successful business, it's clear the company ultimately dropped out of favor with investors.\nI see things much differently with Nvidia. For starters, designing semiconductor chips and high-performance compute is much more sophisticated than producing routers. In other words, while Cisco's hardware was innovative in the early days of the internet, it didn't take long for competing products to emerge.\nNvidia absolutely has competition -- namely, from chip makers Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm. Moreover, tangential competition is quickly entering the scene from the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, and even Tesla. While I agree with Wood that intensified competition could impact demand for Nvidia's chips, I don't think she's giving the company enough credit.\nInvestors should realize that unlike Cisco, Nvidia has optionality. The company is diversifying its model outside of semiconductors and is building an end-to-end AI platform.\nAlthough the chip arena has a rising number of entrants, Nvidia still holds a competitive advantage. The company is a pioneer in the GPU space, providing Nvidia with an enviable first-mover position. While it's plausible that Nvidia could lose some of its pricing power and market share over time, I don't see the competition as too much of a threat.\nMoreover, with a whopping $26 billion of cash on the balance sheet, Nvidia has been aggressively investing in all sorts of areas across the AI spectrum in an effort to expand beyond chips. Two high-profile applications that Nvidia is exploring include humanoid robotics and enterprise software.\nNvidia recently joined OpenAI, Microsoft, and Intel in a $675 million funding round for robotics start-up Figure AI. On top of that, the company is currently an investor in Databricks -- the world's most-valuable privately held software business. I see both of these partnerships as ways for Nvidia to bolster its under-the-radar software operation -- which is already a one-billion-dollar revenue run rate business.\nCould Nvidia end up as the next Cisco? Of course, anything is possible. I think what's more likely is that if Nvidia's bets in robotics and software don't pan out, then the company could begin to experience decelerating growth. A situation like that could absolutely cause some panic-induced selling from investors.\nBut in my opinion, I don't see that happening. I am encouraged and impressed by all of the moves Nvidia is making outside of chips. While the stock is certainly enjoying some momentum, I think Nvidia can keep it up -- and I'm optimistic that the company's best days are ahead.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock soared 82.5% in the first quarter of 2024. (The market's quarter ended on Thursday, as U.S. financial markets were closed on Friday for the Good Friday holiday.) That performance made the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader the second-best performer on the S&P 500 index, behind only Super Micro Computer, a server specialist that's also benefiting from strong demand for AI products and services.\nFor context, in the first quarter, the S&P 500 gained 10.2%, and notched an all-time closing high on Thursday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index gained 9.1%.\nThe main catalyst behind Nvidia stock's amazing performance so far in 2024 can be stated in two words: artificial intelligence. More specifically, it's generative AI, which has significantly expanded the potential applications of AI. This tech enables users to quickly generate new content of various types based on a variety of input categories, such as images and sounds.\nGenerative AI captivated the tech world in November 2022 when OpenAI broadly released ChatGPT. This chatbot's popularity skyrocketed, leading to a frenzy among companies and other entities to obtain generative AI capabilities.\nNvidia's data center platform is its primary beneficiary of the strong demand among entities of all types to acquire generative AI capabilities. The data center is Nvidia's largest platform, accounting for 83% of its total revenue in its quarter ended Jan. 28. This business has been growing like gangbusters, as will be quantified below.\nNvidia's data center graphics processing units (GPUs) accelerate the processing of AI and high-performance computing workloads. The company's current flagship data center GPU is the H100, and its next Hopper architecture-based GPU, H200, is scheduled to begin shipping in the second quarter of this year. Its data center GPUs based on its next-generation architecture, Blackwell, promise a huge leap in performance and are expected to launch later this year.\nIn 2023, Nvidia stock rocketed 239%, earning it the No. 2 spot among the S&P 500 index's top performers. (Super Micro Computer was the best performer with a 246% gain.) For context, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite returned 26.3% and 44.6%, respectively, last year.\nNvidia stock's momentum at the end of 2023 and through late February 2024 was driven by the company's release of blockbuster quarterly results on Nov. 23, 2023. In its third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Oct. 29, 2023), Nvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surged 206% and 593%, respectively, year over year. Growth was powered by the data center platform's revenue soaring 279% from the year-ago period.\nIn 2024 through Feb. 21 (when the company released its next round of quarterly results), Nvidia stock gained 36.2%.\nOn Feb. 21, Nvidia released its report for its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Jan. 28). It was another blockbuster report, fueled by the data center platform's phenomenal AI-driven growth.\nFor the quarter ended Jan. 28, Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS rocketed 265% and 486%, respectively, year over year. Both results easily beat Wall Street's estimates. Growth was driven by the data center platform's 409% revenue surge. The gaming and professional visualization platforms also performed well, with their year-over-year revenue jumping 56% and 105%, respectively.\nInvestors propelled shares up 16.4% on the day following the earnings release, and the stock continued to move upward through the end of the first quarter of 2024.\nNvidia is poised to turn in another fantastic quarterly report.

        "Author": "  Max A. Cherney, Stephen Nellis and Medha Singh ",
        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney, Stephen Nellis and Medha Singh\nSAN JOSE, California (Reuters) -Nvidia's stock climbed on Tuesday after the heavyweight chipmaker said its new flagship AI processor is expected to ship later this year and CEO Jensen Huang said he is chasing a data center market potentially greater than $250 billion.\nNvidia's stock rose nearly 2% to $901 after Huang and Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress answered questions from investors at the company's annual developer conference in San Jose, California. The shares had dipped nearly 4% earlier in the day.\n\"We think we're going to come to market later this year,\" Kress said, referring to the company's new AI chip, which the company debuted on Monday.\nHuang estimated that companies operating data centers will spend more than $250 billion a year to upgrade them with accelerated computing components that Nvidia specializes in developing. He said that market was growing by as much as 25% a year.\nNvidia is shifting from selling single chips to selling total systems, potentially winning a larger chunk of spending within data centers.\n\"Nvidia doesn't build chips, it builds data centers,\" Huang said.\nCalled Blackwell, Nvidia's new processor combines two squares of silicon the size of the company's previous offering. Nvidia also detailed a new set of software tools to help developers sell artificial-intelligence models more easily to firms that use its technology.\nNvidia is working with contract chip manufacturer TSMC to avoid bottlenecks in packaging chips that slowed shipments of its previous flagship AI processor, Huang said.\n\"The volume ramp in demand happened fairly sharply last time, but this time, we've had plenty of visibility\" into demand for Blackwell chips, Huang said.\nSome analysts said Wall Street has already factored in the debut of the B200 Blackwell chip, which the company claims is 30 times faster at some tasks than its predecessor.\nThe Blackwell chip will be priced between $30,000 and $40,000, Huang told CNBC.\nHuang later clarified that comment, saying Nvidia will include its new chip in larger computing systems and that prices will vary based on how much value they provide.\n\"The Blackwell technology shows a significant performance uplift compared to Hopper (the current flagship chip) but it's always hard to live up to the hype,\" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors.\nIn a discussion about Nvidia's cooperation with South Korean chipmakers, Huang said Nvidia is qualifying Samsung Electronics' high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips.\nReuters reported last week that Samsung's HBM3 series have not yet passed Nvidia's qualification for supply deals.\nSamsung's cross-town rival SK Hynix on Tuesday said it has begun mass production of next-generation HBM3E chips, with sources saying initial shipments will go to Nvidia this month.\nAt the center of Wall Street's AI euphoria, Nvidia's stock has more than tripled over the past 12 months, making it the U.S. stock market's third-most valuable company, behind only Microsoft and Apple.\nEven after that meteoric rally, Nvidia is trading at about 35 times its expected earnings, cheap compared with its PE of 58 a year ago, according to LSEG data.\nThat decline in Nvidia's PE valuation is the result of analysts massively increasing their estimates of the chipmaker's future earnings, and if those forecasts turn out to be too optimistic, Nvidia's stock risks plummeting back to earth.\nNvidia expects major customers including Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, OpenAI and Tesla to use its new chip.\nIts hardware products will likely remain \"best-of-breed\" in the AI industry, Morningstar analysts said, lifting their estimates for Nvidia data-center revenue for 2026 and 2028.\n\"We remain impressed with Nvidia's ability to elbow into additional hardware, software, and networking products and platforms,\" they said.\nThe software push shows how Nvidia, whose chips are mostly used to train large-language models like Google's Gemini, is trying to make its hardware easier to adapt for companies rushing to integrate generative AI into their businesses.\nMany analysts expect Nvidia's market share to drop several percentage points this year, as competitors launch new products and the company's largest customers make their own chips, although its dominance is expected to remain unchallenged.\n(Reporting by Medha Singh and Aditya Soni in Bangalore and Stephen Nellis and Max A.

        "Text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is being supercharged by the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks of Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nWith the exception of Apple and Tesla, each of these AI stocks has handily beaten the S&P 500 over the last year. Nvidia stands out in a league of its own, however.\nThe stock is up nearly 260% in the last year, and the company has added a trillion dollars of market cap in less than 12 months. With such a meteoric rise, investors may be thinking that they've missed the boat.\nLet's dig into the current state of Nvidia's business and, more importantly, take a look at what catalysts could be in store for future growth. Now could be as good a time as ever to begin building a position in this monster AI stock.\nNvidia manufactures graphics processing units (GPU) that are used across an array of generative AI applications, including accelerated computing and machine learning. Demand for the company's flagship A100 and H100 chips is staggering, and it doesn't seem to be slowing down.\nNvidia recently reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2024, which ended Jan. 28. For the full year, the company generated $60.9 billion in revenue -- up 126% year over year. But what's even more encouraging is the company's margin expansion and profitability growth. \nIn fiscal 2024, Nvidia's gross margin was 72.7% -- an increase of nearly 16 percentage points over the prior year. On top of that, the company's free cash flow of $27 billion surged sixfold year over year.\nWith a financial performance like this, the music eventually has to stop, right? I wouldn't bank on that just yet.\nDespite Nvidia's record growth last year, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is that the ride could just be getting started.\nNvidia is expected to increase its top line by roughly 78% this year, followed by modest growth over the next couple of years. Admittedly, forecasting beyond one year can be more of an art than a science. As an investor, I'm not placing too much credence on estimates beyond fiscal 2025.\nOne of the reasons I'm suspicious that the estimates above could be conservative is that investors are now just learning about some intriguing new catalysts. For starters, news broke a couple of weeks ago that Nvidia is an investor in voice-recognition software company SoundHound AI.\nThe terms of the partnership are not entirely known. However, Nvidia is just the latest big tech company to explore AI-powered voice assistants. Cohorts including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have all invested significantly in similar technology -- thereby signaling that voice recognition could be a lucrative pocket of the overall AI landscape.\nIn addition, during the fourth-quarter earnings call, investors learned that Nvidia also has a budding enterprise software business. While it's still early innings for Nvidia on the software front, I see many reasons to be optimistic about this endeavor. Namely, it shows that the company is already expanding beyond semiconductor chips.\nMoreover, software tends to carry much higher margins than hardware development. Given that competition in semiconductor manufacturing will likely rise over the next few years, I wouldn't be surprised to see some margin deterioration, as Nvidia will likely lose some of its pricing power.\nNevertheless, it appears the company is already looking to outmaneuver such a dynamic by complementing its core data center operation with a software component.\nDuring fourth-quarter earnings, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a bold statement when he declared that \"accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point.\" On the surface, you might think this means Nvidia's rocket ship may be returning from orbit. But that's not the case.\nRather, Huang went on to explain his philosophy in further detail. He believes that the installed base for data center infrastructure could double within the next five years. Given Nvidia's commanding position in this market, combined with the catalysts outlined above, investors have several reasons to believe that there could be substantial upside in Nvidia stock.\nHans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities recently slapped a $1,400 price target on Nvidia stock -- implying roughly 60% upside from current trading levels. Whether or not Nvidia reaches this price, the bigger picture remains.\nAll things considered, secular trends fueling spend in artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to not only stay but actually rise significantly over the next several years. Given Nvidia's unique position across both hardware and software, coupled with an increasing number of use cases and applications, I see Nvidia's growth journey as just beginning.\nNow could be an interesting time to begin using dollar-cost averaging to build a position or add to an existing holding in Nvidia stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been hot over the short and long terms. Shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader have returned a whopping 241% in just one year, and 21,320% over the 10-year period through March 27. (For context, the S&P 500 index returned 34% and 242%, respectively, over these periods.)\nGiven these amazing performances, it's natural to wonder if it's too late to invest in Nvidia stock. A tool that can be useful in helping you make investing decisions is the outlining of where you think a company's business will be in the future. Concentrate on the business; don't focus on the stock. Over the longer term, the stock will perform well if the business is performing well.\nIn March 2020, I outlined where I thought Nvidia's business would be in five years, or in March 2025. This article is a Year 4 update of those predictions.\nStatus at Year 4: On target.\nIn March 2020, I wrote that \"as long as [Huang] stays healthy, the odds seem in favor of his still being at Nvidia's helm in five years.\" For context, co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang turned 61 earlier this year, according to public records.\nMany CEOs who are very wealthy retire early. But as I said in 2020, \"One only needs to listen to the company's quarterly earnings calls to know that this is a guy who just loves his work.\" Four years later, it's still evident that Huang is intellectually energized by his work.\nStatus at Year 4: On target -- and Nvidia has increased its market share.\nHere's a snippet from my March 2020 article:\nNvidia dominates the market for discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the key component in graphics cards for desktop computer gaming. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company controlled 68.9% of this market...\nNvidia has not only remained the leader in this category, but has increased its market share over the last four years. In the fourth quarter of 2023, it had an 80% share of the desktop discrete GPU market, compared with Advanced Micro Devices' 19% share, according to Jon Peddie Research. Intel, which entered this market in Q3 2022, had a 1% share.\nStatus at Year 4: On target. \nThe global video gaming market grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 13% during the four-year period ended in 2023, according to Statista. Its market size was about $250 billion in 2023.\nStatus at Year 4: On target -- and Nvidia has increased its market share.\nIn March 2020, I wrote, \"Nvidia is sitting in the catbird seat when it comes to profiting from this humongous [artificial intelligence] growth trend.\"\nThis topic is a huge one and deserves its own article. Suffice it to say here that Nvidia's dominance in the overall AI chip market has increased over the last four years. Moreover, the market size itself has been rapidly growing, thanks in large part to the strong demand for chips to enable generative AI capabilities. Generative AI, which is the tech behind OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, \"enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety of inputs,\" in the words of Nvidia.\nStatus at Year 4: My timeline will likely be too optimistic.\nThis topic also deserves its own article. In short, I still fully believe in this prediction, but my timeline will likely be too optimistic, so I get at least a partial \"ding\" in this category. In March 2020, I wrote:\nIn 2025, fully autonomous vehicles should be legal -- or very close to being so -- across the United States. Nvidia is well positioned to majorly profit from [this event]. It's inked partnerships with major players, [and I listed a bunch of auto industry companies].\nStatus at Year 4: Achieved.\nIn March 2020, I wrote, \"Nvidia is incredibly innovative, so there seems a great chance that the company will introduce at least one major new technology that takes nearly everyone by surprise.\"\nThis prediction has already come true. Nvidia has launched a handful of major new technologies that have likely surprised almost everyone. One example is its Omniverse platform, which enables enterprises to create their own metaverses.\nStatus at Year 4: Even with one year left to 2025, it seems safe to say that my \"solidly outperform the market\" prediction in the below quote will hold true. \nHere's what I wrote in March 2020:\nIt's impossible to predict a company's stock price in five years because so many unknowns ... can have a huge influence on the market in general. That said, given the projections made in this article, I feel very comfortable predicting that Nvidia stock will solidly outperform the market over the next half decade. [Emphasis mine]\nAs the above chart shows, Nvidia stock has returned 1,210% in the just over four-year period since my March 2020 predictions article. The S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index have returned 81% and 89%, respectively, over this period.\nBased upon this four-year update to my 2020 predictions, I feel confident that Nvidia stock will solidly outperform the market over the next five years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "When it comes to investing in artificial intelligence (AI), it may seem like Nvidia is the main focus of investors. The company has muscled its way into the \"Magnificent Seven\" as it claims between 80% and 95% of the AI chip market.\nHowever, Nvidia has also grown to a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 36, leading some to question whether that stock has become overvalued. Investors may want to look to other AI stocks, and two hold the potential to deliver outsize investor returns.\nInvestors may have to look no further than Nvidia's manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM). As the leading producer of the world's most advanced chips, TSMC makes Nvidia's success possible. Additionally, it is the leading manufacturer of chips for companies like Apple and AMD and has even attracted business from an emerging competitor in its industry, Intel.\nAs a result of this book of business, TSMC claimed 61% of the third-party foundry market in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to TrendForce.\nAdmittedly, amid geopolitical tensions on its home island of Taiwan, many investors, including Warren Buffett, have shown reluctance to invest in TSMC stock. Still, the company has mitigated this by building more fabs outside of Taiwan. Moreover, a source of geopolitical tension, China, depends on TSMC's chips, reducing the likelihood that it would put its supply chain at risk.\nThe company also seems to be recovering from the recent downturn in the chip market. Revenue of $69 billion fell 5% from year-ago levels. That led to a comprehensive net income of $27 billion, 22% less than year-ago levels.\nStill, analysts forecast a 22% increase in revenue this year and a further 20% rise the following year. Such optimism took the stock price 55% higher over the last year.\nConsequently, it now sells at a P/E ratio of about 26. While that is not low for this company, it compares favorably to earnings multiples for other chip stocks. And as demand from companies like Nvidia leads to rising production, TSMC stock will likely continue on its higher trajectory.\nAI has also changed the game for another chip manufacturer, Micron Technologies (NASDAQ: MU). Micron produces the memory chips that help drive the AI revolution. Indeed, the memory chip industry has historically experienced more volatility than its counterparts that produce CPUs and GPUs. This led to no net gains in the stock between the mid 1990s and mid 2010s.\nNonetheless, the secular bull market in AI chips has changed the game for this stock, leading to a continuous rise in demand for memory chips. Consequently, the stock gained 140% over the last five years, beating the S&P 500's total return and leading to Micron becoming a dividend stock.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Nov. 30, 2023), revenue of $4.7 billion rose 16% yearly. This signals a recovery in the memory market, as Micron's revenue declined 49% in fiscal 2023. Amid the struggles, the fiscal Q1 net loss was $1.2 billion, which improved from the $1.4 billion loss in the year-ago quarter.\nStill, analyst forecasts call for a 34% increase in revenue in fiscal 2024 and a 42% rise in the following fiscal year. This could stoke a dramatic recovery that returns Micron to profitability as soon as this fiscal year.\nInvestors are optimistic, so much so that they have bid the P/S ratio to around 7, the highest sales multiple since the early 2000s, as the stock sells near all-time highs. As the AI revolution continues, the rising need for memory chips and increasing revenue likely means Micron stock will stay on an upward trajectory.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "What Nvidia\u2019s new Blackwell chip says about AI\u2019s carbon footprint problem",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Kahn ",
        "Text": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI.\nThe biggest show in AI this week is Nvidia\u2019s GTC developer conference in San Jose, Calif. One Wall Street analyst quipped the chipmaker\u2019s confab was the equivalent of \"AI Woodstock,\" given all the heavy-hitters present from not just Nvidia, but companies such as OpenAI, xAI, Meta, Google, and Microsoft, and the presence of executives from major companies looking to implement AI, including L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Lowe\u2019s, Shell, and Verizon.\nAt GTC yesterday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the company\u2019s newest graphics processing unit (GPU), the kind of chips that have become the workhorses of AI. The forthcoming Blackwell GPU will have 208 billion transistors, far exceeding the 80 billion its current top-of-the-line H100 GPUs have. The larger chips mean they will be twice as fast at training AI models and five times faster at inference\u2014the term for generating an output from an already trained AI model. Nvidia is also offering a powerful new GB200 \u201csuperchip\u201d that would include two Blackwell GPUs coupled together with its Grace CPU and supersede the current Grace Hopper MGX units that Nvidia sells for use in data centers.\nWhat\u2019s interesting about the Blackwell is its power profile\u2014and how Nvidia is using it to market the chip. Until recently, the trend has been that more powerful chips also consumed more energy, and Nvidia didn\u2019t spend much effort trying to make energy efficiency a selling point, focusing instead on raw performance. But in unveiling the Blackwell, Huang emphasized how the new GPU\u2019s greater processing speed meant that the power consumption during training was far less than with the H100 and earlier A100 chips. He said training the latest ultra-large AI models using 2,000 Blackwell GPUs would use 4 megawatts of power over 90 days of training, compared to having to use 8,000 older GPUs for the same period of time, which would consume 15 megawatts of power. That\u2019s the difference between the hourly power consumption of 30,000 homes and just 8,000 homes.\nNvidia is talking about the Blackwell\u2019s power profile because people are growing increasingly alarmed about both the monetary cost of AI and its carbon footprint. Those two factors are related since one reason cloud providers charge so much to run GPUs is not just the cost of the chips themselves, but the cost of the energy to run them (and to cool the data centers where they are housed since the chips also throw off more heat than conventional CPUs). And both those factors have made many companies reluctant to fully embrace the generative AI revolution because they are worried about the expense and about doing damage to net zero sustainability pledges. Nvidia knows this\u2014hence its sudden emphasis on power consumption. The company has also pointed out that many AI experts working on open-source models have found ways to mimic some aspects of the performance of much larger, energy-intensive models such as GPT-4 but with models that are much smaller and less power-consuming.\nCurrently, data centers consume just over 1% of the world\u2019s power, with estimates that AI is a fraction of that. Schneider Electric recently estimated that AI consumes about as much power annually as the nation of Cyprus. That number may climb rapidly due to AI. One expert at Microsoft has suggested that just the Nvidia H100s in deployment will consume about as much power as all of Phoenix by the end of this year.\nStill, I have always thought the focus on AI\u2019s energy consumption in data centers was a bit of a red herring, since most of the data centers of the cloud hyperscalers, which is where most AI is being run right now, are now powered by renewable energy or low-carbon nuclear power. And the fact that these companies are willing to contract for large amounts of renewable power at set prices has played a key role in giving renewable power companies the confidence to build large wind and solar power projects. The presence of these hyperscalers in the renewables market has meant there is more renewable power available for everyone. It\u2019s a win-win. (Far more troubling is the water consumption needed to keep these data centers cool. Here consuming less power, and generating less heat, would have a more direct impact on sustainability.)\nThat said, AI is a global phenomenon, and there are some places where there isn\u2019t much renewable power available. And if AI is adopted to the extent many project, and if AI models keep getting larger, it is possible renewable energy demand could outstrip low carbon supplies even in the U.S. and Europe. That\u2019s one reason Microsoft has expressed interest in trying to use AI to speed up the process of getting new nuclear plants approved for construction in the U.S.\nIt is also true that AI\u2019s energy consumption is among the many areas where our own brains are vastly superior to the artificial ones we\u2019ve created. The human brain consumes about 0.3 kilowatt hours daily by burning calories, compared to about 10 kilowatt hours daily for the average H100. To really make AI ubiquitous without destroying the planet in the process, we may need to find a way to get artificial neural networks to operate with an energy profile that looks a bit more like the natural ones.\nThat\u2019s essentially what the U.K.\u2019s Advance Research and Invention Agency (Aria, which is the country\u2019s answer to the U.S. Defense Department\u2019s DARPA) is hoping to bring about. Last week, Aria announced it was committing \u00a342 million ($53 million) to fund projects working towards reducing the current energy footprint of running AI applications by a factor of a thousand. It said it would consider radically different ways of building computer chips in order to do so, including chips that rely on biological neurons for computation instead of silicon transistors. (I wrote about one such effort in 2020.)\nThe effort is pretty sci-fi and may not yield the results Aria hopes. But the very fact the Aria challenge exists and that Nvidia is now putting energy efficiency on center stage at GTC are signs the world is getting serious about tackling AI\u2019s carbon footprint. Hopefully, this means AI won\u2019t destroy our efforts to build a more sustainable world.\nThere\u2019s more AI news below.

        "Text": "No company embodies the Artificial Intelligence (AI) age more than  Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), whose GPUs (graphic processing units) are being used in data centers to power AI applications.\nNvidia's growth has been extraordinary. The company grew its revenue an incredible 265% in Q4 to $22.1 billion, with Data Center revenue soaring 409% to $18.4 billion. And with Nvidia's growth, investors have benefited, with the stock more than tripling over the past year.\nThe AI revolution has led to comparisons between the Internet boom and bust. Not surprisingly, the company Nvidia is most compared to is Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO), which was the backbone of the Internet.\nCisco became the world's most valuable company in 2000, but its stock crashed soon afterwards and Cisco investors never fully recovered. The stock still trades well below its all-time high today.\nSo, can Nvidia and its investors avoid the same fate as Cisco investors?\nIn many ways, the rise of Nvidia is reminiscent of Cisco back in the late 1990s and early 2000s. During that period, Cisco was the leader in providing the infrastructure equipment used to power the Internet boom through its network routers, much like Nvidia is powering the AI revolution through its GPUs today.\nAnd like Nvidia, Cisco in 2000 was primarily a hardware business. This is important because software revenue is more recurring and higher margin. As a result, investors typically assign higher multiples to software businesses. Neither Nvidia nor Cisco are primarily software businesses, and their multiples should reflect this.\nWhile Nvidia and Cisco in 2000 share these similarities, there are key differences. One is that Nvidia's Cuda software platform has been a key differentiator for the company since it was introduced in 2006, even though Nvidia gives it away for free.\nThis software platform allows Nvidia GPUs to be programmed directly, saving customers time and money. By the time alternatives evolved, Nvidia GPUs had already become the industry standard. This created a wide moat for the company. Investors like wide moat businesses as these companies face less competition.\nCisco in 2000 was just starting to get more meaningfully into software with the introduction of its CiscoWorks2000 network management software when its stock peaked. Today, software is about a third of its revenue.\nNvidia and Cisco's customer bases are also quite different. Cisco was heavily selling into the cable and telecom industries, where companies typically carry meaningful leverage and have unpredictable capex cycles. Capex is the purchase of assets meant to be used over a long period. Nvidia is selling into the data center, where cash-flush companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) preside. This gives Nvidia a more stable customer base, which is another positive for investors.\nCSCO data by YCharts\nNvidia also trades at a much lower valuation than Cisco did at its peak in March 2000. At its highs, Cisco had a nearly 200x P/E ratio. .\nNvidia, meanwhile, trades at around 60x P/E, and has been growing its revenue more quickly. In 2023, Nvidia's revenue surged 126%, while Cisco's revenue rose 55% in its fiscal year 2000. Investors generally assign larger multiples for high revenue growth, and there are few companies growing as quickly as Nvidia.\nThe biggest risk Nvidia faces is one that eventually hurt Cisco: demand suddenly drying up after the initial order surge. In 2001, Cisco took a large inventory write-off because in the race to meet insatiable demand, it acquired too much inventory and then demand suddenly dropped off. This was essentially Cisco saying the components it purchased to build its networking equipment were now basically worthless.\nCurrently, there seems no end in sight for GPU demand as companies build out their AI infrastructure. However, Cisco in 2000 believed there was no end in sight to the demand for networking routers. That outlook did not end well for Cisco investors.\nNvidia also has a bit more customer concentration than Cisco did in 2000, with one indirect customer representing 19% of sales in 2023. Customer concentration adds more risk, because if a large a customer pulls back on spending, it can lead to a negative earnings surprise, which tends to put pressure on stocks.\nNvidia is currently one of the best growth stories in the market. While there are similarities between it and Cisco 2000, they are also key differences. Nvidia is also much cheaper than where Cisco was when it peaked and it's been growing faster. Investors need to be aware of the risks, but AI still appears to be in the early innings. After all, AI wasn't a huge topic of conversation a few years ago, and now nearly every company is talking about it. Investors can continue to ride Nvidia's great growth, but just be aware it might not last forever.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cisco Systems right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Cisco Systems, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cisco Systems wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Better AI Stock: AMD vs. Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Whether you're a casual investor or trade professionally, you're likely aware of the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) that kicked off last year. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reignited interest in the technology, leading countless tech companies to pivot their businesses toward the high-growth sector.\nAs a result, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which will see it hit just under $2 trillion. The industry is expanding at a rapid pace, making it one of the best places to make a long-term investment.\nTwo stocks currently leading the way in AI are Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), with their shares recently up 149% and 257% respectively year over year. As prominent chipmakers, these companies supply the hardware necessary to train and run AI models. Their stocks could soar further in the coming years as the market develops.\nSo, let's compare these companies' businesses and determine whether AMD or Nvidia is the better AI stock this March.\nAMD was slightly overshadowed by Nvidia's head start in AI chips last year, as Nvidia seized an estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs).\nHowever, the massive potential of the industry suggests AMD won't need to dethrone Nvidia to still see major gains from AI. So, despite spending years prioritizing its position in central processing units (CPUs), AMD has shifted its focus to developing its GPU technology and expanding in the budding AI market.\nLast December, the company unveiled its MI300X AI GPU. The chip was designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings and has already caught the attention of some of tech's most prominent players.\nIn November 2023, Microsoft announced that Azure would become the first cloud platform to use AMD's MI300X to optimize AI capabilities. Microsoft has a close partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, making the company a powerful ally for AMD. An agreement with Meta -- which aims to use the new chips as well -- also helps AMD's future in AI look bright.\nMoreover, AMD isn't banking solely on stealing market share from Nvidia in GPUs. AMD seeks to lead its own space within AI by investing in AI-powered PCs. According to research firm IDC, PC shipments are projected to see a major boost this year, with AI integration serving as a key catalyst. And a Canalys report predicts that 60% of all PCs shipped in 2027 will be AI-enabled. \nNvidia captivated Wall Street over the last year as its chips became the gold standard for AI developers everywhere.\nSoaring demand for AI GPUs enabled Nvidia's revenue to skyrocket. In the fourth quarter of 2024 (ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The monster growth was primarily from a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting increased chip sales.\nIn addition to soaring earnings, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion.\nSo, despite new GPU releases from its competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain its market supremacy.\nNvidia has a powerful position in AI that looks unlikely to dissipate anytime soon. Its market cap surpassed $2 trillion this year thanks to its massive success in AI. AMD's market cap is significantly lower at about $327 billion. However, that could mean AMD has more room to run over the long term as the company is still in the early stages of its AI journey. \nAI can potentially boost countless industries, from cloud computing to consumer products, autonomous vehicles, video games, and more. With so many sectors prioritizing generative technology, chip demand is only likely to continue rising for the foreseeable future.\nAs a result, AMD and Nvidia are two exciting options to invest in AI. However, earnings per share (EPS) estimates indicate AMD might have more growth potential in the near term.\nThis chart shows AMD's earnings could hit just over $7 per share in the next two fiscal years, while Nvidia's may reach $34 per share. On the surface, Nvidia looks like the clear winner. However, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (AMD's 56 and Nvidia's 35) yields stock prices of $403 for AMD and $1,197 for Nvidia.\nConsidering their current positions, these projections would see AMD's stock rise 99% and Nvidia's 41% by fiscal 2026.\nAlongside heavy investment in AI and potentially more room to run, AMD is the better AI stock over Nvidia and a screaming buy this month.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In the world of artificial intelligence (AI) investments, few would debate that Nvidia is at the top of the world. But what many investors don't know is that Nvidia is an investor itself.\nBecause Nvidia has investments totaling at least $100 million, it must disclose those holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a 13F filing, reported quarterly. Its latest report included five companies, but one I am most interested in is SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN).\nFor Nvidia to invest in a particular AI player is a big deal, as innovators throughout the industry rely on its sophisticated chips. This means the company likely has more information than the average person on SoundHound's prowess, which investors should note.\nFrom the name, it's obvious that SoundHound AI does something with audio and artificial intelligence. Its products are mainly focused on two areas: restaurants and automobiles. But its audio products can easily expand into other areas.\nOne example of a use in the automobile sector is its integration of ChatGPT into Stellantis DS vehicles. This will give drivers a much more powerful digital assistant experience, and 50% of regular drivers say they will utilize it.\nOn the restaurant side, SoundHound recently announced a revamped phone ordering experience with Jersey Mike's Subs. This fully automated experience can take multiple orders at once with extreme accuracy, freeing employees up to do other tasks rather than take orders.\nThis type of automation will only become more prevalent, and a recent study by SoundHound found that 8 of 10 customers believe this kind of order will be the standard in the next few years.\nSoundHound's product rollout is just in the early stages, and with the heightened awareness of AI capabilities, mass adoption will likely occur soon.\nBut does that make the stock a buy?\nSoundHound is a relatively small company, posting only $17 million in revenue during the fourth quarter of 2023 (and that was up 80% from the same period the year before). However, it has a massive backlog, with $661 million still in the pipeline for deals already signed. If SoundHound delivers on these deals, it will produce impressive growth, which is likely why Nvidia is investing in it.\nThe problem with cash-burning companies like SoundHound is that it's a race against the clock to become profitable. While the company ended 2023 with almost $100 million in cash, it lost more than $68 million in operations and relied on loans and new equity for its funding. Fortunately, management has been prudent with its cash balance and improving its margins. SoundHound's losses in earnings per share (EPS) improved from $0.15 to $0.07. And given SoundHound's success and massive backlog, it shouldn't have an issue raising additional capital if it needs more liquidity.\nSo far, SoundHound seems like a stock that could be a great investment. But there's still one factor to consider: valuation.\nBuying the right stock at the wrong price can be disastrous. SoundHound AI was a well-priced stock at the start of the year, but after a strong quarterly report and news of Nvidia's investment, its price exploded.\nSOUN PS Ratio data by YCharts\nSoundHound's stock is incredibly expensive around 38 times sales, especially when other AI software stocks trade between 10 and 20 times sales. But if SoundHound can grow its revenue from $17 million per quarter to $100 million per quarter in a few years, today's stock price may not be a bad deal.\nIt all comes down to its future execution, which is impossible to judge right now. So what should investors do?\nIf you're interested in the company and believe it has a strong chance to succeed, taking a small position (no more than 1% of your portfolio) isn't a bad idea. That way, it won't affect your portfolio too much if it fails. But if it succeeds, it will still make a strong return.\nSoundHound has a great product and a lot of momentum, but that's already priced into the stock. Investing now means you have extreme confidence in SoundHound due to its steep price. As a result, I'd wait until the pandemonium caused by Nvidia's investment dies down a bit before taking a position in SoundHound.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Max A. Cherney and Stephen Nellis ",
        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney and Stephen Nellis\nSAN JOSE, California (Reuters) - Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang on Monday kicked off his company's annual developer conference with a slew of announcements designed to keep the chip maker in a dominant position in the artificial-intelligence industry.\nOn a hockey arena stage in the heart of Silicon Valley, Huang introduced Nvidia's latest chip, which is 30 times speedier at some tasks than its predecessor.\nHe also detailed a new set of software tools to help developers sell AI models more easily to companies that use technology from Nvidia, whose customers include most of the world's biggest technology firms.\nNvidia's chip and software announcements at GTC 2024 will help determine whether the company can maintain its 80% share of the market for AI chips.\n\"I hope you realize this is not a concert,\" Huang said, wearing his signature leather jacket and joking that the day's keynote would be full of dense math and science.\nIt was a nod to how Nvidia, once mostly known among computer gaming enthusiasts, has earned recognition on par with tech giants like Microsoft and has become a Wall Street standout, with sales that more than doubled in its most recent fiscal year to surpass $60 billion.\nNvidia's new flagship chip, called the B200, takes two squares of silicon the size of the company's previous offering and binds them together into a single component.\nWhile the B200 \"Blackwell\" chip is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots, Huang did not give specific details about how well it performs when chewing through huge amounts data to train those chatbots - which is the kind of work that has powered most of Nvidia's soaring sales. He also gave no price details.\nAll together, Huang's announcements failed to provide new fuel for a rally in which Nvidia's shares have surged 240% over the past 12 months, making it the U.S. stock market's third-most valuable company, behind only Microsoft and Apple. Nvidia stock dipped 1.4% in extended trade, while Super Micro Computer, which makes AI-optimized servers with Nvidia's chips, fell 4%. Advanced Micro Devices stock dipped nearly 3% during the keynote.\nTom Plumb, CEO and portfolio manager at Plumb Funds, whose largest holdings include Nvidia, said the Blackwell chip was not a surprise.\n\"But it reinforces that this company is still at the cutting edge and the leader in all graphics processing. That doesn't mean the market is not going to be big enough for AMD and others to come in. But it shows that their lead is pretty insurmountable,\" said Plumb.\nNvidia said major customers including Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and Oracle, are expected to use the new chip in cloud-computing services they sell, and also for their own AI offerings.\nNvidia also is shifting from selling single chips to selling total systems. Its latest iteration houses 72 of its AI chips and 36 central processors. It contains 600,000 parts in total and weighs 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg).\nMany analysts expect Nvidia's market share to drop several percentage points in 2024 as new products from competitors come to market and Nvidia's largest customers make their own chips.\n\"Rivals like AMD, Intel, startups, and even Big Tech's own chip aspirations threaten to chip away at Nvidia's market share, particularly among cost-conscious enterprise customers,\" said Insider Intelligence analyst Jason Bourne.\nThough Nvidia is widely known for its hardware offerings, the company has built a significant battery of software products as well.\nThe new software tools, called microservices, improve system efficiency across a wide variety of uses, making it easier for a business to incorporate an AI model into its work, just as a good computer operating system can help apps work well.\nIn addition to AI software, Nvidia dived deeper into software for emulating the physical world with 3-D models. For work on designing cars, jets and products, Huang also announced partnerships with design software companies Ansys, Cadence and Synopsys. Shares of the three companies jumped around 3% in extended trade following Huang's comments.\nHuang also said that Nvidia's software would be able to stream 3-D worlds to Apple's new Vision Pro headset.\nNvidia also introduced a new line of chips designed for cars with new capabilities to run chatbots inside the vehicle. The company deepened its already-extensive relationships with Chinese automakers, saying that electric vehicle makers BYD and Xpeng will both use its new chips.\nToward the end of his keynote speech, Huang also outlined a new series of chips for creating humanoid robots, inviting several of the robots made using the chips to join him on the stage.\n(Reporting by Max A.

If the definition is the ability to pass human tests, Huang said, artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive soon.\n\"If I gave an AI ... every single test that you can possibly imagine, you make that list of tests and put it in front of the computer science industry, and I'm guessing in five years time, we'll do well on every single one,\" said Huang, whose firm hit $2 trillion in market value on Friday.\nAs of now, AI can pass tests such as legal bar exams, but still struggles on specialized medial tests such as gastroenterology. But Huang said that in five years it should also be able to pass any of them.\nBut by other definitions, Huang said, AGI may be much further away, because scientists still disagree on how to describe how human minds work.\n\"Therefore, it's hard to achieve as an engineer\" because engineers need defined goals, Huang said.\nHuang also addressed a question about how many more chip factories, called \"fabs\" in the industry, are needed to support the expansion of the AI industry. Media reports have said OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman thinks many more fabs are needed.\nHuang said that more will be needed, but each chip will also get better over time, which acts to limit the number of chips needed.\n\"We're going to need more fabs. However, remember that we're also improving the algorithms and the processing of (AI) tremendously over time,\" Huang said. \"It's not as if the efficiency of computing is what it is today, and therefore the demand is this much. I'm improving computing by a million times over 10 years.\"\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in Palo Alto, California; Editing by David Gregorio)\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been anything but an under-the-radar stock over the last year. After blowing out sales estimates for three straight quarters, shares of the technology company have soared 265% over the last 12 months.\nNvidia is currently the clear leader in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) computing solutions; saying its powerful semiconductors are in high demand is an understatement. And even after the surge in the stock, there are still two good reasons to buy it now.\nNvidia offers a diversified portfolio of products. It makes chips for gaming and offers a cloud-based gaming service. Its omniverse platform helps businesses design and operate manufacturing processes, and the company also supplies the burgeoning autonomous driving industry. But the data center segment is what has investors most excited.\nRevenue from that segment grew 409% year over year in the company's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28). In that quarterly report, CEO Jensen Huang said: \"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations.\" As Huang has previously noted, the era of generative AI is clearly taking off.\nBut there looks to be plenty more growth to come. The market size for generative AI is projected to more than quadruple from the 2023 level by the end of this decade. Nvidia will be a big beneficiary of that growth.\nNvidia isn't just diversified with its products and services, it's also diversified geographically. As the graph below shows, continued sales growth doesn't just rely on the economy of any single country or region.\nEven though a global recession (or a decline in just one of its major markets) will affect Nvidia's performance, there is less risk for investors when sales are spread out geographically.\nThat helps stem some risk, and there are plenty of catalysts for more growth, too. Machine learning has been the major focus of AI development. That is likely to continue for at least several more years, but an increasing number of businesses in multiple sectors are also using AI technology.\nNvidia's automotive segment could also grow quickly if self-driving vehicles become more mainstream. Autonomous and sensor technology is just one more area beyond machine learning where its sales could jump in the future.

Even better, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is a Dow component and would be the most obvious choice for Nvidia to replace.\nHere's what is preventing Nvidia from joining the Dow and why the growth stock deserves to be a Dow component in the near future.\nDow components are usually replaced because they have lost some of their industry leadership or the industry they operate isn't as important to the economy anymore. At a price of just $42 per share, Intel is the second-smallest component of the price-weighted index, ahead of Verizon.\nIntel stock is doing well, up over 66% in the last year. It is in the same industry as Nvidia, but it isn't a direct competitor. There's some crossover in gaming, PCs, and data centers. But Intel's main growth driver is getting into the foundry business. And Nvidia could even be a customer of Intel's advanced packaging services.\nIntel doesn't deserve to be replaced. It makes up such a small portion of the Dow that the semiconductor industry is, in many ways, unrepresented. It may be better to swap a different component for Nvidia. But we are getting ahead of ourselves.\nThe first thing Nvidia has to do is split its stock. Amazon could be added only because it split its stock in June 2022. With a price of nearly $900 a share and the median price of a Dow component around $175 a share, Nvidia would have to issue at least a 5-for-1 stock split to avoid tilting the balance of the index.\nAnother issue is timing. There's no schedule for Dow shakeups. But they don't happen too often. Given Amazon just got added, it's unlikely we'll get another swap for at least a couple of years. Alphabet may be first in line for a swap considering its history, market position, and the fact it already split its stock in July 2022.\nDeciding which component to replace, the stock split ratio, and the timing of the next index restructuring are all relatively minor challenges in the grand scheme of things. The bigger question is whether Nvidia deserves to be a blue-chip Dow stock or if its growth is fleeting.\nNvidia is an unrecognizable business from just a few years ago. And it's all because of data centers.\nGo back to fiscal 2022, and the Graphics segment a far larger segment than Compute and Networking (led by data centers) for Nvidia, generating nearly double the operating income. But in just two years, Compute and Networking performance exploded. In fiscal 2024, Compute and Networking made up 77.8% of total revenue and 84.5% of segment-operating income, with operating income up nearly seven times in that period.\nCustomers are rapidly building AI models and demanding more and more output from Nvidia's chips. However, the semiconductor industry is cyclical. Right now, demand is outpacing supply, driving prices and margin expansion for Nvidia.\nFor Nvidia to sustain its torrid growth rate, AI has to be worth the expense for businesses. In other words, they have to make money on the solutions. For example, if Apple spends a fortune developing an AI assistant for every iPhone and tries to charge a monthly fee that many customers are unwilling to pay, then it's probably not going to accelerate its spending.\nMicrosoft is having breakout success with its AI solutions, like Copilots for Microsoft 365, GitHub AI, Azure AI for cloud infrastructure, and more. It's working now, but the pace of growth could change based on the market, the economy, and customer reception of these solutions.\nNo one knows when it will happen, but Nvidia will eventually enter a downturn, and its growth will slow. At that point, earnings will fall, and the stock will look more expensive -- as is the nature of cyclical industries. The market may be less willing to pay up for Nvidia during that period.\nNvidia has the makings of a Dow stock. But the growth of its data center business has happened in a flash.\nBefore Nvidia gets added to the Dow, the market will need to see how this business does during a downturn and mid-cycle conditions. No company is going to get added to the Dow just because its business is hot right now. If that were the case, PayPal could have been added in early 2021 to replace or pair with Visa. Three years ago, PayPal briefly overtook Mastercard in market cap but is worth around seven times less than Mastercard today. Or Zoom Video Communications could have been added in 2020.\nThere are plenty of periods in the stock market where investors get super excited about a theme and drive valuations higher. I don't think AI is a bubble, and I think much of Nvidia's growth is here to stay. But I do expect the pace of growth to slow and want to get a better look at how Nvidia's data center business performs during that slowdown. I suspect the folks in charge of the Dow Jones Industrial Average feel the same.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are two of the market's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Nvidia's high-end GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks in data centers, while Microsoft is a leading investor in OpenAI. Microsoft has also been integrating OpenAI's generative AI tools directly into its cloud, search, and productivity tools.\nOver the past three years, Nvidia's stock has soared more than 600% while Microsoft's stock has rallied just over 70%. Nvidia was clearly the better play on the booming AI market, but will it continue to outperform Microsoft over the next few years?\nIn fiscal 2024, which ended this January, Nvidia's revenue surged 126% to $60.9 billion as its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soared 288%. That marked a dizzying acceleration from its flat revenue growth and 25% decline in adjusted EPS in fiscal 2023.\nThe company struggled in fiscal 2023 as the PC market's post-pandemic slowdown throttled its sales of gaming GPUs. The crypto market's meltdown exacerbated that pressure as disillusioned miners flooded the market with secondhand GPUs.\nThe macro headwinds also drove some companies to rein in their purchases of new data center GPUs.\nBut in fiscal 2024, the soaring popularity of ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms sparked a buying frenzy in its data center GPUs. Its sales of gaming GPUs also stabilized in the second half of the year as the PC and crypto markets recovered.\nNvidia generated 78% of its revenue from its data center GPUs in fiscal 2024, and the market's demand is still outstripping its supply by a wide margin. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect its revenue to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 39%. Those growth rates are astonishing, but its stock still doesn't look terribly expensive at 39 times forward earnings.\nNvidia seems like a simple way to profit from the growth of the generative AI market, which Fortune Business Insights estimates will have a CAGR of 47.5% from 2023 to 2030. But investors shouldn't overlook its longer-term challenges.\nAMD is rolling out cheaper data center GPUs, its top cloud customers are developing their own first-party chips, and start-ups like Groq are creating faster dedicated chips to process natural language queries. Chinese chipmakers could also launch alternative AI chips to counter the export curbs on Nvidia's top-tier chips.\nMicrosoft is more diversified. Its sprawling ecosystem houses its Windows operating system, Office productivity software, Azure cloud infrastructure platform, Bing search engine, Xbox gaming business, and Surface hardware devices.\nIn fiscal 2023 (which ended last June), Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS both rose 7% as the expansion of its cloud business -- which includes Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365 -- offset the slower growth of its Windows, Surface, and Xbox divisions, which all faced fierce headwinds as the PC and gaming markets cooled off in a post-pandemic world.\nBut for fiscal 2024, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS to increase 15% and 19%, respectively, as the growth of its cloud business accelerates again. That acceleration was driven by the integration of OpenAI's generative AI tools directly into Microsoft's cloud-based services.\nAs result, Microsoft's Azure -- the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform -- has been growing faster than the market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS), as well as its third-place competitor, Alphabet's Google Cloud.\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue to have a CAGR of 14% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 16%. Those estimates assume its cloud business will continue to expand, the PC market will recover, and its acquisition of Activision Blizzard will significantly strengthen its Xbox gaming division.\nThose growth rates suggest Microsoft is still a sound way to profit from the expansion of the cloud, AI, and gaming markets -- but its stock isn't cheap at 30 times next year's earnings. If Microsoft's cloud business loses its momentum or antitrust regulators challenge its investments in OpenAI, its valuations could decline and drive its stock lower.\nNvidia and Microsoft are both promising plays on the AI market, but Nvidia's simpler business model, higher growth rates, and more reasonable valuations make it the better buy. Nvidia's investors should keep an eye on the competitive and regulatory headwinds, but it could be years before any of those challenges limit its growth.\nUntil then, Nvidia will continue to sell the market's best shovels for the AI gold rush -- and it could even eclipse Microsoft's market cap in just a few years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Medha Singh ",
        "Text": "By Medha Singh\n(Reuters) - Nvidia is nipping at the heels of Apple to become the world's second-most-valuable company, as investors cannot get enough of the semiconductor maker whose chips power popular artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT.\nAn AI-induced jaw-dropping rally in Nvidia shares has taken the company's valuation from $1 trillion to more than $2 trillion in just nine months, overtaking Amazon.com, Google-parent Alphabet and Saudi Aramco on the way.\nNvidia's market capitalization currently hovers around $2.38 trillion, lagging Apple by just about $230 billion and Microsoft by about $645 billion.\nThe relentless rise in shares of Nvidia, which controls 80% of the high-end AI chip market, has been instrumental in pushing Wall Street to record levels this year, while giving the company a more than 5% weightage on the benchmark S&P 500 index.\nNvidia, which is up 95%, and Meta Platforms, which is up 46.6% so far this year, have also outperformed shares of other members of the so-called Magnificient 7, highlighting investors' insatiable appetite for everything AI.\n\"Nvidia's rally reflects the incredibly strong fundamentals underlying its current business model,\" said Richard Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.\n\"It is also finding strong speculative support as a favorite among long option buyers who have seen almost a straight upward climb throughout 2024.\"\nMeanwhile, Apple, which is grappling with slowing iPhone sales, ceded its position as the most valuable U.S. company to Microsoft for the first time since 2021 in January.\nIn recent weeks, Nvidia also replaced Tesla as Wall Street's most traded stock by value.\nThe stock's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36.6 is lower than where it was a year ago despite the stock's strong run as analysts raised its profit estimates.\nBy comparison, Intel's PE multiple is 30.24 and that of Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index is 39.6, LSEG data showed.\n\"Nvidia is in fact the cheapest of the \"AI narrative\" stocks out there,\" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors.\n\"We continue to believe that in five years or 10 years we will all be talking about an industry that is far larger than the numbers being bandied about today.\"\nHowever, there are signs Nvidia stock is nearing a peak.\nOver the next 12 months, Wall Street analysts' median target price implies Nvidia would trade at $850 per share, below the last closing price of $926, LSEG data showed.\n\"Of course, it is very difficult for any mega-cap stock's price to continue to grow at this pace as the law of large numbers eventually comes into play. But the stock price could remain at these levels if the company can continue to meet or exceed the high expectations of analysts,\" Cherry Lane's Meckler said.\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) is diving deeper into the robotics game with the debut of a new foundation model for humanoid robots dubbed Project GR00T.\nA foundation model is a type of AI system trained on massive amounts of data that\u2019s capable of being used for a wide variety of tasks from generating sentences to videos, images, and more.\nAccording to Nvidia, Project GR00T will help humanoid robots \u201cunderstand natural language and emulate movements by observing human actions \u2014 quickly learning coordination, dexterity, and other skills in order to navigate, adapt, and interact with the real world.\u201d\nNvidia also announced its Isaac Manipulator and Isaac Perceptor, part of the company\u2019s Isaac robotics platform. Isaac Manipulator is a series of foundation models designed for robotic arms, while Issac Perceptor is meant to offer \u201cmulti-camera, 3D surround-vision capabilities\u201d for robots designed to take on manufacturing and fulfillment roles.\nIn addition to those, the graphics giant also debuted its Jetson Thor computer for humanoid robots. The platform, which is powered by Nvidia\u2019s Thor system-on-a-chip, will serve as the brains of humanoid robots.\n\u201cJetson Thor was created as a new computing platform capable of performing complex tasks and interacting safely and naturally with people and machines. It has a modular architecture optimized for performance, power, and size,\u201d Nvidia said in a statement.\nThe company says it\u2019s already working with some of the biggest names in robotics including Boston Dynamics, famous for its Spot robot, 1X Technologies, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, and Figure AI.\nFigure AI, in particular, has been making waves of late, releasing a video last week in which it showed a humanoid robot speak as though it was a person in response to prompts and complete a series of tasks, including picking up dishes and putting them in a drying rack.\nWhile that may seem relatively mundane, the technology needed to get the robot to recognize each item and move them precisely is incredibly sophisticated.\nIn February, Nvidia, as well as Microsoft, OpenAI, Jeff Bezos, Parkway Capital, Intel Capital, and others, took part in a Series B funding round for Figure AI valuing the company at $2.6 billion.\nHumanoid robots offer the promise of being able to complete dangerous or rote tasks for people, though as with other AI technologies, they also raise the specter of displacing human jobs. Still, don\u2019t expect humanoid robots to start strolling down the street anytime soon.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) jumped again on Tuesday, adding to its ongoing winning streak this year. The stock gained ground as the trading day wore on and by the time the market closed, the stock was up 7.2%.\nThe broader market was decidedly mixed today, looking for direction, but the catalyst that helped send the chipmaker higher was strong quarterly results by Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). The company cited strong demand for AI-centric cloud services with demand far outstripping supply. Oracle also cited a recent cloud-infrastructure contract with Nvidia and hinted at more to come, saying \"We expect to have some very nice joint announcements with Nvidia next week,\" at the company's GPU Technology Conference (GTC), which begins on Monday.\nThis announcement adds to the growing mountain of evidence that the demand for generative AI is just getting started. Nvidia has nabbed the pole position by supplying the graphics processing units (GPUs) equipped to handle the rigors of AI processing. Furthermore, rivals have been unable to come up with a better solution, allowing Nvidia to dominate the field -- in two ways.\nFirst, Nvidia is the leading provider of the GPUs used in data centers, with a dominant 98% of the market, according to Wells Fargo analysts. Since the vast majority of AI computing is done in the cloud and data centers, this benefits Nvidia. Second, the company is also the go-to for processors used in machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI -- controlling a 95% share of that market as well. This gives Nvidia an entrenched position, a clear advantage over would-be challengers.\nAs a result, Nvidia has delivered three consecutive quarters of record-setting growth, highlighted by triple-digit, year-over-year revenue and profit growth, with another triple-digit quarter on tap.\nThis leads to the quintessential investing question: Is Nvidia stock a buy. After the company's recent blockbuster earnings, Nvidia's valuation dropped significantly, currently trading for 36 times forward earnings. While that's a premium compared to a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 for the S&P 500, Nvidia's track record of blockbuster growth illustrates that its deserving of a premium.\nIt seems clear that the demand for AI will continue, with Nvidia sitting at the toll gate. This, in turn, will profit the company -- and investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is It Worth Investing in Nvidia (NVDA) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.20 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 40 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.5% and 5% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>The ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs NVDA a Good Investment?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 16.4% over the past month to $23.22.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Avi Kapoor ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation  (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares closed lower on Monday after recording sharp gains in the recent period.\nThe company\u2019s stock gained around 19% over the past month, adding 78% year-to-date. On March 7, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh maintained NVIDIA with a Buy rating and raised the price target from $850 to $1,000.\nNVIDIA was recently sued by three authors for allegedly using their copyrighted works without permission to train its AI platform. The lawsuit was filed on Friday in a San Francisco federal court by authors Brian Keene, Abdi Nazemian, and Stewart O\u2019Nan, Reuters reported.\nWith the recent buzz around NVIDIA, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company\u2019s dividends too. As of now, NVIDIA offers an annual dividend yield of 0.02%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 4 cents per share (16 cents a year).\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $32,165,250 or around 37,500 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $6,433,050 or around 7,500 shares.\nRead This:  $1.5M Bet On This Penny Stock? Check Out These 4 Stocks Under $5 Insiders Are Aggressively Buying \nTo calculate:  Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.16 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.16 = 37,500 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.16 = 7,500 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nHow that works:  The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current price.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nNVDA Price Action: Shares of Nvidia fell 2% to close at $857.74 on Monday.\nRead This Next:  Cramer Says This Healthcare Stock Can Go Higher, Calls Manhattan Associates 'A Winner'\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From NVIDIA Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - How long can Nvidia and its CEO, Jensen Huang, wear the crown as the tech world's dominant supplier of artificial-intelligence chips?\nWhether it is months, years or decades, the question will be key when Huang - who co-founded Nvidia in 1993 and has been CEO ever since - sets foot on the stage of a Silicon Valley hockey arena on Monday to unveil new flagship products.\nThe occasion is the company's annual developer conference, the first to be held in person since the pandemic. Nvidia expects 16,000 people to attend its GTC event live, roughly double the number who went to the 2019 show in person.\nNvidia's market capitalization topped $2 trillion in late February, and it is now a \"mere\" $400 billion away from eclipsing Apple as Wall Street's second-most valuable company, behind stock market leader Microsoft.\nAnalysts expect Nvidia's revenue to soar 81% this year to $110 billion as companies snap up its top-of-the-line chips by the tens of thousands to power chatbots, image generators and other AI systems.\nThat is double the sales that analysts expect from Intel, the chipmaker that dominated the personal computer boom. The question for Nvidia is whether it can parlay its recent, massive lead in AI computing into long-term dominance of a new era of computing.\nAt the center of that effort will be Nvidia's next generation of high-end AI processor, which analysts expect to be called the B100. The chip will sit at the center of the AI systems that Nvidia sells and will likely start shipping later this year.\nDemand for Nvidia's current AI chips has outstripped supply, with software developers waiting months for a chance to use AI-optimized computers at cloud providers.\nNvidia is unlikely to give specific pricing, but the B100 is likely to cost more than its predecessor, which sells for upwards of $20,000.\nNvidia's stock has surged 83% in 2024 after more than tripling last year. Even after that meteoric rally, Nvidia is trading at 34 times its expected earnings, cheap compared with its PE of 58 a year ago, according to LSEG data.\nThat decline in Nvidia's PE valuation is the result of analysts massively increasing their estimates of the chipmaker's future earnings, and if those forecasts turn out to be too optimistic, Nvidia's stock risks plummeting back to earth.\nThe shares dipped 1.1% to close at $908.88 on Wednesday.\n\"The biggest concern is the numbers have just gotten so big, so quickly, you just worry they can't last,\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said of Nvidia's recent financial performance. \"The more new products they've got coming out at higher performance and higher prices, the more runway they have.\"\nNvidia will also likely introduce a raft of updates to its software known as CUDA, which provides tools for developers to run their AI programs on its chips, helping keep developers tied to Nvidia's chips. CUDA makes it harder to switch to components sold by rivals like Advanced Mirco Devices and in-house chips offered by Microsoft and Alphabet's Google.\nNvidia last year started offering its chips and software as a cloud service to developers, and analysts are monitoring how the company expands that effort.\n\"The services side is really a software play,\" said Ryan Shrout of chip analysis firm Shrout Research. He said analysts will closely observe whether cloud and software providers are \"possibly getting nervous about Nvidia playing in their playground.\"\nCHINA BUSINESS\nAnother critical question is whether Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia will establish a definitive technology advantage over Chinese rivals. Washington has cut off China's access to Nvidia's most advanced chips, and China has responded with chips from Huawei Technologies Co that rival the performance of Nvidia's A100 chip released in 2020.\nNo Chinese company has yet claimed to match Nvidia's current flagship H100 chip released in 2022, and China-watchers expect the forthcoming B100 to leave China further behind.\n\"When the government developed these controls, they knew very well that companies like Nvidia would be on an almost annual basis making improvements in their silicon, their software coding and their application stack,\" said Jimmy Goodrich, an expert on China and semiconductors. \"Over time, that gap will just become exponentially larger.\"\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max A.

Chinese automakers Zeekr, a unit of Geely, and Li Auto had previously said they would use Nvidia's Drive Thor technology.\nChinese auto brands are turning to Nvidia as they use advanced technology to compensate for what they currently lack in global brand recognition. BYD and its rivals are driving to expand sales in Europe, Southeast Asia and other markets outside China, while competing with Tesla and other established Western vehicle brands in their home market.\n\"There's a massive number of Chinese automakers,\" Shapiro said. \"They have a lot of incentives in place to innovate, a lot of regulation that\u2019s favorable\" to developing increasing levels of automated driving.\nAmong other new automotive and industrial partnerships announced by Nvidia on Monday is a collaboration with U.S. software company Cerence to adapt large language model artificial-intelligence systems for in-car computing, Shapiro said.\nChinese computer maker Lenovo is also collaborating with Nvidia on large language model deployment, Nvidia said.\nSoundhound will use Nvidia technology to develop an in-vehicle voice command system that could allow a vehicle owner to obtain information from a virtual owners manual using speech commands.\nNvidia did not refer to OpenAI or other large language model AI developers by name.\n(Reporting by Joe White in Detroit; Editing by Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Title": "Even After Rallying 239% in 1 Year, Nvidia Stock Still Isn't Expensive According to This Key Metric",
        "Author": "  Daniel Foelber, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the talk of the town in 2023, and it continues to be a Wall Street darling in 2024. It's arguably the single most important stock behind the artificial intelligence trend currently fueling the market.\nAs Nvidia has climbed higher and the broad market also reaches new all-time highs, skeptics have sounded the alarm for a stock market bubble. And while the market is stretched thinner than in years past, there's still reason to believe Nvidia is not necessarily overvalued, despite its 439% gain since the beginning of 2023.\nSay what you want about Nvidia stock's epic rise, but the company is delivering on every measure with a one-two punch of high revenue growth and expanding margins.\nRevenue has more than tripled in the last year, while net income is up over 500%. That level of growth for a company as big as Nvidia is incredible.\nThe past year of gains has also pushed Nvidia to trade with a 66.2 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a steep premium to even its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers. However, the average analyst estimate for Nvidia's fiscal 2025 earnings per share is $23.92, roughly double last year's result.\nThe surge in anticipated profits gives Nvidia a much more reasonable forward P/E ratio. In fact, Nvidia has a lower forward-looking valuation than Tesla, Amazon, and Microsoft.\nYou would be hard-pressed to find a growth stock that has nearly quadrupled in the last year with that low of a forward P/E ratio.\nAt the same time, there are a few reasons why focusing only on forward P/E is dangerous for a company like Nvidia. First, Nvidia still has to double its profits in the current fiscal year -- a high bar for any company, let alone one this size. The even more significant risk to consider is that Nvidia operates in a cyclical industry.\nTypically, cyclical stocks have low P/E ratios during an expansion and high P/E ratios during a downturn. The idea is that investors won't pay too high of a price during times of elevated earnings but also won't sell off a stock just because there's a contraction in the cycle. Over time, the median P/E ratio works itself out to something more reasonable.\nA good example is agriculture and construction giant Deere. The company's earnings are slowing as the current expansion period nears an end. However, Deere's P/E ratio is just 10.6 because its trailing earnings are high, but investor sentiment is negative (shares are down 14% in the past year). Its 10-year median P/E ratio is a much higher 17.1 -- which makes sense -- the long-term median should be higher than Deere's current valuation. But in a downturn, investors can expect Deere's P/E to climb higher than that long-term baseline.\nThe opposite is happening with Nvidia. Its 66.1 P/E is higher than its 46.7 10-year median. But again, you could argue Nvidia deserves a much higher valuation given its scorching hot growth rate and earnings outlook for this year.\nNvidia is exciting because it's growing quickly, and it's already such a valuable company that it can drive the whole market. Nvidia has already become a bit of a story stock, a company valued based more on its hype and potential than its fundamentals. But Nvidia isn't priced for perfection, either -- its 32.1 forward P/E ratio is reasonable, especially relative to the other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. After all, Nvidia has almost always carried a premium, and there's no reason that should change in this part of its growth journey.\nPersonally, I'd prefer to buy Nvidia when the expectations are lower, and there's more margin for error. Nvidia's short-term performance could take a turn for the worse due to macroeconomic conditions and factors outside its control. And with the stock sitting at its peak, there's a heavy expectation its growth will march on uninterrupted. A forward P/E ratio above 30 is acceptable for a company likely to double its earnings this year, but that will change quickly if the company fails to deliver.\nProspective investors should be cautious about those expectations, as well as the behavior patterns of cyclical stocks. The easy money has already been made, and with Nvidia's market cap reaching $2 trillion, expecting the stock to again triple in the near term isn't realistic.\nAs an individual investor considering Nvidia for your portfolio, it's up to you to decide what kind of price you're willing to pay for the stock and what you expect from the business at that price.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n View our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt in January 2024, down from US$11.0b, one year before. However, it does have US$26.0b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$16.3b.\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, NVIDIA had liabilities of US$10.6b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$12.1b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$26.0b in cash and US$10.00b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has US$13.2b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nThis state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$1.95t company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\nBetter yet, NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 489% last year, which is an impressive improvement. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, NVIDIA generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 80% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that NVIDIA has net cash of US$16.3b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. The cherry on top was that in converted 80% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$27b. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with NVIDIA .\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at Nvidia (NVDA), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nSet to Beat the Market?\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for NVDA that show why this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\nFor NVDA, shares are up 6.38% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry is up 0.78% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 18.72% compares favorably with the industry's 5.86% performance as well.\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Nvidia have increased 71.28% over the past quarter, and have gained 273.48% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 11.16% and 34.3%, respectively.\nInvestors should also take note of NVDA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, NVDA is averaging 57,676,532 shares for the last 20 days.\nEarnings Outlook\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with NVDA.\nOver the past two months, 15 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost NVDA's consensus estimate, increasing from $19.95 to $23.22 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 10 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\nBottom Line\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that NVDA is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Nvidia on your short list.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  James Holbach ",
        "Text": "With the huge wave of hype recently surrounding artificial intelligence, investor interest in chip manufacturers is as high as it has ever been. Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) are among the biggest players in this space. NDVA, in particular, has been on a tear recently, as the graphics processing units it specializes in are especially useful in AI applications. INTC is more of a stalwart in the industry but has remained relevant since its founding in 1968. Which of the two is the better investment? Let\u2019s take a look.\nFind Out: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t SellRead More: 5 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nSponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity.\nWhile both companies are huge and likely to be financially stable, that doesn\u2019t mean they are on equal footing. The Altman Z-Score is a financial measure used to determine the bankruptcy risk of a business \u2013 both NVDA and INTC have a Z-score high enough to garner a \u201csafe\u201d rating. Both companies also have about $7 billion in cash on their balance sheets. However, given that NVDA\u2019s market cap is significantly higher, this indicates that INTC probably has a safer balance sheet.\nEdge:\u00a0INTC\nA company\u2019s future growth prospects are another important factor to consider before investing. You might expect NVDA to be the clear winner here, as its recent performance has been so impressive, and INTC is no longer considered a growth company \u2014 but that kind of outperformance is hard to maintain. Analysts expect NVDA to grow at about 36% per year over the next five years, which is certainly above average. However, analysts expect INTC to grow by 43% per year over the same period. Surprisingly, it looks like INTC has the best growth prospects in the near to mid-term.\nEdge:\u00a0INTC\nProbably the most important consideration when analyzing an investment is valuation \u2013 at the end of the day, the price you pay determines your return. Even an amazing business can be a bad investment at the wrong price. The most commonly used metric for publicly traded stocks is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The lower the ratio, the cheaper the stock, and all other things are equal. You might guess that high-flying NVDA is more richly priced than INTC, but this is another surprise. INTC is trading at a trailing twelve-month P/E ratio of 111.3 as of 3/6/24, while NVDA is trading at 74.6 over the same period. It\u2019s worth noting that INTC is in the middle of a turnaround effort, so the market is pricing in the prospect of better earnings in the near future \u2013 nevertheless, NVDA appears to be the cheaper stock on paper.\nEdge:\u00a0NVDA\nArguably, NVDA has the brightest future of the two stocks \u2013 but again, it\u2019s important to remember that just being a good business doesn\u2019t make a stock a good investment. When a company has gone through a major growth run, it can often counterintuitively become a risky investment. In this case, INTC looks like the safer choice. However, things can change fast in the stock market, so be sure to re-evaluate your investments regularly.\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Nvidia vs. Intel Stock: Which Is a Better Investment?\n"

        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were climbing again today even though there was no company-specific news on the artificial intelligence (AI) stock juggernaut. However, AI stocks have a tendency to move in unison, and good news from fellow traveler Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) seemed to lift Nvidia stock as well.\nSuper Micro shares jumped after the S&P Global said that the maker of servers and storage equipment that are especially valued for AI applications would join the S&P 500 on March 18. The news acts as a broader stamp of approval for Super Micro and the rest of the AI sector and seemed to spark a new round of euphoria as investors piled into these stocks again.\nNvidia closed at 3.6% after trading up as high as 6.6% earlier in the session, while Super Micro Computer had gained 25.3%. Among the other winners in the AI space were Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which both finished up more than 3%.\nAfter having a banner year in 2023, Nvidia has gotten out to a breakneck start in 2024 as the stock is now up roughly 75% year to date.\nNvidia's own strong fourth-quarter results have helped drive those gains, but it's also surged nearly every time there's been good news out on a peer. For example, last Friday the stock gained when Dell Technologies said it was seeing surging demand for AI servers, and earlier in February, it rose on strong quarterly results from Arm Holdings, a close partner in chip design.\nBoth Super Micro and Nvidia are experiencing massive revenue growth from AI-related demand, and they have been two of the biggest winners from the AI boom. Therefore, it's not surprising to see Nvidia responding to good news for Super Micro.\nUpdates from companies in recent weeks have shown that the AI boom is only picking up steam as cloud-computing companies and others build out their AI infrastructure and products like Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) remain in high demand.\nLater this week, we'll get an update from Broadcom, known for its strength in networking chips which are expected to play a role in AI, and next week Arm Holdings' initial public offering (IPO) lock-up period will expire, which could lead to volatility in that stock.\nEither of those events could move Nvidia stock as well. Expect Nvidia to continue to be volatile on broader AI news, though the surge in demand for AI products makes the stock more likely to go up than down.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has had an incredible rise since the start of 2023, up around 500%. As a direct result of its huge stock price increase, the cost of one Nvidia share is nearing $1,000. This threshold may seem arbitrary, but it's actually an important milestone with a special place in the stock market's mass psychology. Therefore, management teams often consider splitting their stocks around this nice, round number. Furthermore, Nvidia's management team has a history of enacting stock splits.\nIs Nvidia preparing for another split?\nStock splits can have both real and artificial effects. On the artificial side, you're essentially cutting the same-sized pizza into smaller slices. Investors with access to brokerages that offer fractional shares can already cut Nvidia's stock into pieces as small as they want (usually down to one-thousandth of a share).\nHowever, not every investor (especially those outside the U.S.) has access to this capability. In that sense, Nvidia's potential stock split becomes a real factor since more investors can purchase the stock without fear of overweighting their portfolio to one company. If you only have $100 to invest this month, a stock changing hands at $1,000 per share feels out of reach (even if fractional shares are available in your favorite stock brokerage).\nBut will Nvidia do it? The company's history of stock splits suggests that another one could be imminent.\nNvidia has split its stock five times since it went on the market. The latest was in 2021, when it did a 4-for-1 split. The stock traded for around a pre-split price of $744 -- cheaper than it is today.\nBefore that, Nvidia last split its stock in 2007, when it would have traded at a split-adjusted price of just over $50. Stock splits were far more common back then, so the instances before the 2021 split may be less useful for forecasting purposes in 2024.\nNow that the stock price is above 2021 pre-split levels again, I'd say Nvidia is highly likely to enact a stock split.\nAfter Nvidia announced its stock split on May 21, 2021, the stock had a strong run-up until the split took effect on July 20, increasing nearly 40% at its peak.\nThis same time frame would also make sense in 2024, as Nvidia's annual meeting occurs in June. So if you're looking for a stock split announcement, stay tuned to Nvidia's Q1 FY 2025 results, which will be reported sometime in late May.\nIs right now a good time to buy the stock in anticipation of a run-up due to buying frenzies caused by a stock split? I'd say no. The only good reason to buy a stock is if the underlying business is worth owning. In Nvidia's case, the answer to that question has been a resounding \"yes,\" as its graphics processing units (GPUs) have been in high demand due to interest in artificial intelligence (AI) computing.\nNvidia has continuously posted amazing revenue growth figures. Its latest results (Q4 FY 2024, ending Jan. 28) included a revenue rise of 265% to $22.1 billion and a projection for another 234% rise to $24 billion in Q1 FY 2025.)\nThat sounds like a great business. If the company continues to post results like that, management will likely enact a stock split. While some price movement may be associated with that announcement, don't lose sight of the bigger picture: Nvidia has been one of the biggest winners so far in the AI movement.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang showed off new chips aimed at extending his company\u2019s dominance of artificial intelligence computing, a position that\u2019s already made it the world\u2019s third-most-valuable business.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNY Gears Up to Seize Trump Westchester Assets If Fraud Fine Is Unpaid\nBaltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 Each\nWhat Happens If Trump Can\u2019t Post His $454 Million Bond\nTrump-Tied SPAC Deal Approved, Setting Up Potential Windfall\nChina Scrutinizes PwC Role in $78 Billion Evergrande Fraud Case\nA new processor design called Blackwell is multiple times faster at handling the models that underpin AI, the company said at its GTC conference on Monday in San Jose, California. That includes the process of developing the technology \u2014 a stage known as training \u2013 and the running of it, which is called inference.\nThe Blackwell chips, which are made up of 208 billion transistors, will be the basis of new computers and other products being deployed by the world\u2019s largest data center operators \u2014 a roster that includes Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Oracle Corp. Blackwell-based products will be available later this year, Nvidia said.\nBlackwell \u2014 named after David Blackwell, the first Black scholar inducted into the National Academy of Science \u2014 has a tough act to follow. Its predecessor, Hopper, fueled explosive sales at Nvidia by building up the field of AI accelerator chips. The flagship product from that lineup, the H100, has become one of the most prized commodities in the tech world \u2014 fetching tens of thousands of dollars per chip.\nThe growth has sent Nvidia\u2019s valuation soaring as well. It is the first chipmaker to have a market capitalization of more than $2 trillion and trails only Microsoft and Apple Inc. overall.\nThe announcement of new chips was widely anticipated, and Nvidia\u2019s stock was up 79% this year through Monday\u2019s close. That made it hard for the presentation\u2019s details to impress investors, who sent the shares down as much as 3.9% in New York on Tuesday.\nRead More: YOLO Crowd Bets Nvidia Could More Than Double in Value by Friday\nHuang, Nvidia\u2019s co-founder, said AI is the driving force in a fundamental change in the economy and that Blackwell chips are \u201cthe engine to power this new industrial revolution.\u201d\nNvidia is \u201cworking with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry,\u201d he said at Monday\u2019s conference, the company\u2019s first in-person event since the pandemic.\nNvidia didn\u2019t discuss pricing of the new processors, but chips in the Hopper line have gone for an estimated $30,000 to $40,000 \u2014 with some resellers offering them for multiple times that amount. Huang told CNBC on Tuesday that Blackwell chips will be in a similar range.\nThe new design has so many transistors \u2014 the tiny switches that give semiconductors their ability to store and process information \u2014 that it\u2019s too big for conventional production techniques. It\u2019s actually two chips married to each other through a connection that ensures they act seamlessly as one, the company said. Nvidia\u2019s manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., will use its 4NP technique to produce the product.\nWhy Nvidia\u2019s New Blackwell Chip Is Key to AI: QuickTake\nBlackwell will also have an improved ability to link with other chips and a new way of crunching AI-related data that speeds up the process. It\u2019s part of the next version of the company\u2019s \u201csuperchip\u201d lineup, meaning it\u2019s combined with Nvidia\u2019s central processing unit called Grace. Users will have the choice to pair those products with new networking chips \u2014 one that uses a proprietary InfiniBand standard and another that relies on the more common Ethernet protocol. Nvidia is also updating its HGX server machines with the new chip.\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company got its start selling graphics cards that became popular among computer gamers. Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units, or GPUs, ultimately proved successful in other areas because of their ability to divide up calculations into many simpler tasks and handle them in parallel. That technology is now graduating to more complex, multistage tasks, based on ever-growing sets of data.\nBlackwell will help drive the transition beyond relatively simple AI jobs, such as recognizing speech or creating images, the company said. That might mean generating a three-dimensional video by simply speaking to a computer, relying on models that are have as many as 1 trillion parameters.\nFor all its success, Nvidia\u2019s revenue has become highly dependent on a handful of cloud computing giants: Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta Platforms Inc. Those companies are pouring cash into data centers, aiming to outdo their rivals with new AI-related services.\nThe challenge for Nvidia is broadening its technology to more customers. Huang aims to accomplish this by making it easier for corporations and governments to implement AI systems with their own software, hardware and services.\nHuang\u2019s speech kicks off a four-day GTC event that\u2019s been called a \u201cWoodstock\u201d for AI developers. Here are some of the highlights from the presentation:\nNvidia\u2019s Omniverse software and services, which allow users to create digital twins of real-world items, is coming to Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset. Nvidia data centers will send images and video to the device, providing users with a more lifelike experience.\nSiemens AG has integrated Omniverse into its Xcelerator industrial design software. Shipbuilder HD Hyundai will use the technology to save time and money during construction by building complete vessels in the virtual world first.\nChinese electric vehicle maker BYD Co. is switching to Nvidia chips, software and services throughout its operations. This includes using Nvidia for the electronic brains of cars, vehicle design and the robots in its factories. Omniverse also will be used to help car buyers to configure their vehicles.\nProject Groot, consisting of a new computer based on Blackwell, is being made available for makers of humanoid robots. It will allow the robots to understand natural language and copy human movements by observing them. Developing such skills is \u201cone of the most exciting problems to solve in AI today,\u201d Huang said.\nJohnson & Johnson is using Nvidia technology to speed up the development of AI-related software that will use advanced analytics in surgery.\nHuang concluded the event by having two robots join him on stage, saying they were trained with Nvidia\u2019s simulation tools.\n\u201cEverything that moves in the future will be robotic,\u201d he said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Don Lemon Implosion\nWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds\nMagnificent Seven?

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Let's talk about the popular NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company's shares led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The recent share price gains has brought the company back closer to its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s take a look at NVIDIA\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nNVIDIA is currently expensive based on our price multiple model, where we look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, we\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock\u2019s cash flows. We find that NVIDIA\u2019s ratio of 74.73x is above its peer average of 29.23x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Semiconductor industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since NVIDIA\u2019s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NVDA\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on NVDA for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nIn light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

        "Title": "Nvidia's CEO Says AI Is at a \"Tipping Point.\" Is the Stock Still a Buy?",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- garner the most attention from Wall Street.\nEach of these companies is playing a major role in rapid changes across e-commerce, cloud computing, consumer electronics, robotics, advertising, and more. But among the Magnificent Seven, Nvidia may be playing the most important role. The company's graphics processing units (GPU) are fueling applications across the generative AI spectrum -- from machine learning and quantum computing to data centers.\nDuring its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter earnings call on Feb. 21, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared that \"accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point.\" With Nvidia stock up over 230% in the last year, some investors may be wondering what Huang meant, and if it's too late to buy shares.\nLet's dig into Nvidia's earnings report and assess the secular trends fueling demand for generative AI GPUs. While Nvidia stock is certainly enjoying the moment, investors may still come away inspired to buy shares now.\nOftentimes when a company is experiencing unprecedented demand, it will see soaring revenue -- and that's it. In other words, companies sometimes have to reinvest heavily into manufacturing in order to meet that higher demand. This can put a strain on operating margins and profits, even during times of accelerated sales growth.\nBut Nvidia is a rare breed, make no mistake about it.\nThe chart above illustrates Nvidia's revenue, gross profit, net income, and free cash flow on a quarterly basis over the last 10 years. Just look at how steep the slope of each line has become. Not only is the company generating robust top-line growth, but its profits and cash flows are growing in lockstep.\nTaking this a step further, Nvidia is not resting on its laurels. While demand for its industry-leading A100 and H100 GPUs remains strong, the company is investing its profits relentlessly into product innovation. The company is on track to begin shipments of next-generation chips, including the H200 in the second quarter. Moreover, reports suggest that Nvidia plans to release its most powerful chip to date, the B100, later in 2024.\nThe above trends underscore the fact that Nvidia's chips are in high demand. And with newer, improved models expected to reach customers soon, Nvidia's ride could just be getting started.\nAs use cases for AI continue to evolve, so do estimates about the total market size for the technology. A top Nvidia manager recently forecast that the market for AI-powered chips and software would grow to be worth $600 billion. The jury is still out on whether that prediction will prove accurate. However, what analysts are calling for in terms of growth can shed some light on Nvidia's potential.\nWhile Nvidia's trailing-12-month revenue of $61 billion is impressive, perhaps even more encouraging are its long-term growth prospects as estimated by Wall Street analysts. Given Nvidia's status as a market leader in AI GPUs, many clearly believe that the current demand trends can be sustained over the next few years.\nTo me, the biggest risk associated with Nvidia is not its valuation. Rather, I think the competitive landscape is going to become increasingly intense. Nvidia's top rival at the moment is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). However, both Amazon and Microsoft are already developing their own inference and training chips for generative AI models. While Nvidia may have a head start, investors should not turn their backs on its big tech cohorts. While I suspect it'll take a few years for other chips to acquire meaningful market share, Nvidia investors should be considering what other growth drivers the company has beyond AI GPUs.\nOne area that investors may be overlooking at the moment is Nvidia's opportunity in software. While the company is still primarily a hardware developer, Nvidia's software and services business reached a $1 billion revenue run rate during the fourth quarter.\nThis is a big deal for a couple of reasons. First, software tends to come with high margins. Should Nvidia begin to eventually lose share in the chip market, it's likely that its margins will take a hit. However, this could be more than offset if Nvidia continues to see success in software. Additionally, since software services are typically more predictable in terms of demand, I wouldn't be surprised to see investors apply even more of a premium to Nvidia stock in the future.\nAt a price-to-sales ratio of 32, Nvidia stock is trading much higher than its historical levels. However, the company's soaring revenue and profits, coupled with its steadfast reinvestment into new products and its budding software business, could warrant the premium. Given its differentiated business model, full-spectrum platform, and the secular tailwinds fueling AI, I think now is as good a time as ever to scoop up shares of Nvidia and hold them for the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Its share price soared 245% over the past year as businesses clamored to buy its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that have become synonymous with AI.\u00a0But analysts at Goldman Sachs see Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) as a leader in the second and fourth phases of AI, and Cloudflare (NYSE: NET) as a leader in the third phase.\nThe four phases are detailed below. Investors should not think of them as distinct events, but rather as a continuum where a new phase can begin well before the previous one has ended. In other words, all four periods will overlap to some degree.\nPhase 1: Semiconductor companies will generate revenue from chips designed to support AI workloads.\nPhase 2: Cloud businesses will produce revenue by providing access to AI infrastructure.\nPhase 3: Cloud companies will generate revenue by incorporating AI into software and services.\nPhase 4: Many different kinds of organizations will use AI internally to improve operational efficiency.\nThe Goldman analyst team has made sensible selections. Amazon is the largest cloud services provider in the world and the company is already using AI to make its logistics business more efficient. Similarly, Cloudflare has a substantial opportunity to monetize AI through its Workers developer platform, so much so that management believes it could be a leader in AI inferencing.\nRead on to find out why both stocks could be worthwhile long-term investments.\nAmazon is best known for its e-commerce empire. The company operates the most visited online marketplace in the world, and it has reinforced its leadership position by investing heavily in logistics capabilities. That strategy not only allows Amazon to control costs, but also enables the company to support sellers with fulfillment services and delight buyers with timely delivery.\nMeanwhile, Amazon has used its dominance in online retail to create a thriving advertising business. In fact, Amazon has become the third-largest adtech company in the world, and Wedbush Securities analyst Scott Devitt believes it \"is well positioned to continue taking share of global digital advertising spending over a multi-year period.\"\nFinally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top dog in cloud infrastructure and platform services, and it has achieved a strong presence in several subcategories of the cloud computing market. Most notably, consultancy Gartner recently recognized AWS as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) developer services.\nAmazon looked strong in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 14% to $170 billion due to momentum in e-commerce and advertising, as well as a sequential acceleration in cloud computing revenue. Meanwhile, GAAP net income reached $1.00 per diluted share, up from $0.03 per diluted share in the prior year, indicating that cost-control efforts are paying off.\nLooking ahead, AI should be a tailwind for Amazon, both in terms of improving efficiency and boosting revenue. For instance, the company is using machine learning to optimize inventory and delivery routes. That should support continued margin expansion, especially in conjunction with its new regional fulfillment strategy, which reduced shipping costs on a per-unit basis in 2023 for the first time since 2018, according to CEO Andy Jassy.\nMeanwhile, Amazon recently introduced Bedrock, a cloud service for building generative AI applications. The company also announced Amazon Q, a generative AI business assistant. Both products create new monetization opportunities that should help Amazon tap growing demand for AI. Indeed, Jassy believes investments in AI will \"drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.\"\nGoing forward, Wall Street analysts expect Amazon to grow revenue by 11% annually over the next five years. That estimate makes its current valuation of 3.2 times sales seem reasonable, though it is a slight premium to the three-year average of 2.9 times sales.\nI think Goldman has the right idea where Amazon is concerned. Patient investors should consider buying a few shares of this top AI stock today.\nCloudflare provides application, network, and security services that improve the performance of corporate infrastructure and software across public clouds and private data centers. Additionally, the company offers compute and storage services through its Workers developer platform that help businesses build and deploy applications, and it has been particularly focused on enabling artificial intelligence.\nLast year, CEO Matthew Prince said, \"By our estimates, Cloudflare is the most commonly used cloud provider across leading AI start-ups.\" He also stated that the company was \"uniquely positioned to become a leader in AI inferencing.\" Prince was referring to Workers AI, a recently launched service that lets businesses run AI applications on Nvidia GPUs installed across its network.\nCloudflare operates the fastest cloud network on the market, and Forrester Research recently recognized the company as the leader in edge development platforms. Those qualities could indeed help Cloudflare become a major player in the AI inferencing market, despite tough competition from Amazon and Microsoft.\nCloudflare reported strong fourth-quarter financial results. Its customer count climbed 17% and the average existing customer spent 15% more over the past year. In turn, revenue increased 32% to $362 million in the fourth quarter, and non-GAAP net income more than doubled to $53 million. Investors have good reason to think that momentum will continue\nGoing forward, Grand View Research believes the edge computing market will grow by 37% annually through 2030, and Cloudflare is poised to capitalize on that opportunity given its strong position in edge development platforms. But the International Data Corp. has also ranked Cloudflare as a leader in zero-trust network access, and that market is forecast to expand by 17% annually through 2030.\nCollectively, Cloudflare has a good shot at 20% annual revenue growth through the end of the decade, and that estimate could be conservative depending on how well the company monetizes AI. Either way, its present valuation of 23.7 times sales is tolerable. To be clear, that multiple is not cheap, so shares will almost certainly be volatile. But patient investors comfortable with that risk should consider buying a small position in this growth stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It's an outstanding feat for NVIDIA to have grown EPS from US$1.76 to US$12.09 in just one year. Even though that growth rate may not be repeated, that looks like a breakout improvement. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. NVIDIA shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 21% to 54%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for NVIDIA's future EPS 100% free.\nOwing to the size of NVIDIA, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$92b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\nNVIDIA's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering NVIDIA for a spot on your watchlist. Even so, be aware that  NVIDIA is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a definite mover and shaker in recent years. The company has become the world's No. 1 artificial intelligence (AI) chip designer, holding 80% of the market. And this has translated into skyrocketing earnings, with revenue and net income soaring in the triple digits last year. And Nvidia continues to innovate, recently announcing the upcoming launch of a new chip architecture -- the Blackwell platform -- and its most powerful chips ever.\nThis tech company isn't one to sit still, so it's natural that investors love to try predicting its next big move. And right now, I'm going to jump in and share my prediction of what we might expect next from Nvidia. I'll give you a clue: The company's stock has soared past a level that, in the past, coincided with a key decision.\nNvidia shares have climbed more than 240% over the past year, bringing the company's market value to $2.2 trillion, and today trade at the record level of more than $900. Back in May of 2021, when its stock was trading for about $700, Nvidia announced a 4-for-1 stock split and aimed to win approval during its June annual meeting.\nI predict this scenario could happen again this spring -- with an announcement potentially during the company's next earnings report in May -- as Nvidia prepares for its next shareholder meeting. That's likely to take place in June if we consider calendars from previous years.\nWhy do I think Nvidia will make the move soon? For a few reasons. First, as mentioned, Nvidia's last stock split happened when the company's stock price reached similar levels. So, the company has been known to announce such an operation after significant gains and as the stock approached $1,000.\nSecond, a stock price near $1,000 or beyond makes it difficult for some investors to get in on the investment opportunity. Sure, fractional shares exist, but some brokerages don't offer them, and in certain cases, investors prefer buying full shares. Also, other investors may worry that even if valuation looks good, a stock still will struggle to advance significantly once it reaches into the thousands of dollars -- and that could make them hesitate before buying a $900 stock.\nBy splitting its stock, a company erases all of those problems, opening the door to a broader range of investors.\nNext, it's important to keep in mind that Nvidia has completed five stock splits in the past, meaning the company is amenable to this kind of action. The earlier splits happened between 2000 and 2007.\nNow, let's consider how a potential split would work and the impact it may have on Nvidia's share performance. During a split, a company offers additional shares to current shareholders to bring down the price of each individual share, while keeping the market value as is. The resulting stock price is determined by the ratio of the split, whether it's 4-for-1 like Nvidia's most recent operation or a different proportion.\nIf you're a current shareholder, the value of your investment will remain the same, but you'll find yourself with additional shares.\nStock splits themselves aren't catalysts for share price performance, so I wouldn't count on a potential Nvidia stock split to push the stock higher. To use the past as an example, Nvidia stock didn't immediately rise after the 2021 stock split. The shares did advance later that year, though, but that was thanks to fundamentals, such as gains in revenue.\nThat said, a stock split, by making the shares more accessible to a wide range of investors, may prompt more and more of them to consider the stock rather than to opt for lower-priced players. This is positive over the long term, but doesn't result in sudden share price gains.\nSo, my prediction is the moment is right for Nvidia to split its stock, and it may be the company's next big move. But it doesn't matter whether you buy the stock today or after a potential split -- in both cases, you could win by getting in on this great long-term AI story.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Micron Technology",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Both Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) have been highly profitable investments in the past year, with their share prices rising rapidly thanks to the way artificial intelligence (AI) has supercharged their businesses.\nWhile Nvidia stock has gained 255% in the past year, Micron's gains stand at 91%. If you are looking to add one of these two AI stocks to your portfolio right now, which one should you be buying?\nNvidia has been the go-to supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for major cloud computing companies looking to train AI models. The demand for Nvidia's AI GPUs was so strong last year that its customers were waiting for as long as 11 months to get their hands on the company's hardware, according to investment bank UBS.\nNvidia's efforts to manufacture more AI chips and meet this heightened customer demand have been successful, allowing it to lower the wait time to three to four months. This goes some way to explaining why the company's growth has been stunning in recent quarters.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's revenue shot up a whopping 265% year over year to $22.1 billion. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings jumped 486% to $5.16 per share.\nThat eye-popping growth is set to continue in the current quarter. Nvidia's revenue estimate of $24 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 would translate into a year-over-year gain of 233%.\nAnalysts are expecting the company's earnings to jump to $5.51 per share in the current quarter, which would be a 5x increase over the year-ago period's reading of $1.09 per share. Even better, Nvidia should be able to sustain its impressive momentum for the rest of the fiscal year as well, especially since it expects the demand for its upcoming AI GPUs based on the Blackwell architecture to exceed supply.\nNvidia management pointed out on its February earnings conference call that, although the supply of its current-generation chips is improving, the next-generation products will be \"supply constrained.\" That won't be surprising, as Nvidia's upcoming AI GPUs, which will start shipping later in 2024, are reportedly four times more powerful when training AI models as compared to the current H100 processor.\nNvidia also expects a 30 times increase in the AI inference performance with its Blackwell AI GPUs. This should help it cater to a fast-growing segment of the AI chip market, as the market for AI inference chips is expected to grow from $16 billion in 2023 to $91 billion in 2030, according to reporting from Verified Market Research.\nThe good part is that customers are already lining up for Nvidia's Blackwell processors, with Meta Platforms expecting to train future generations of its Llama large language model (LLM) using the latest chips.\nAll this explains why analysts are forecasting Nvidia's earnings to increase from $12.96 per share in fiscal 2024 to almost $37 per share in fiscal 2027. That translates into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of almost 42%, suggesting that Nvidia could remain a top AI growth play going forward.\nThe booming demand for Nvidia's AI chips is turning out to be a solid tailwind for Micron Technology. That's because Nvidia's AI GPUs are powered by high-bandwidth memory (HBM) from the likes of Micron.\nOn its recent earnings conference call, Micron pointed out that Nvidia will be deploying its HBM chips in the H200 processors, which are set to be available to customers beginning in the second quarter. Micron management also added that it is \"making progress on additional platform qualifications with multiple customers.\"\nThe demand for Micron's HBM chips is so strong that it has sold out its entire capacity for 2024. What's more, the memory specialist says that \"the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply has already been allocated,\" indicating that AI will continue to drive robust demand for Micron's chips.\nMicron is also looking to push the envelope in the HBM market. The company has started sampling a new HBM chip with 50% higher memory, which will allow the likes of Nvidia to make more powerful AI chips going forward. As such, booming HBM demand will positively impact Micron's financials, with the company estimating that it will \"generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in fiscal 2024.\"\nThe HBM market is expected to generate almost $17 billion in revenue this year -- accounting for 20% of overall DRAM industry revenue -- as compared to $4.4 billion in 2023. Even better, it could keep getting bigger in the long run on the back of the fast-growing AI chip market. As a result, Micron should be able to sustain the impressive growth it has started clocking now.\nThe company's revenue in the recently reported fiscal second quarter of 2024 (which ended on Feb. 29) was up 57% year over year to $5.82 billion. The revenue guidance of $6.6 billion for the ongoing quarter would be a bigger jump of 76% from the year-ago period. So, Micron's aggressive AI-driven growth is just getting started.\nGiven the data above, Micron may turn out to be the better AI play compared to Nvidia because of one simple reason: At almost 37 times sales, Nvidia stock is way more expensive when compared to Micron's price-to-sales ratio of 6.4. Also, Micron is significantly cheaper than Nvidia as far as the forward earnings multiple is concerned.\nOf course, Nvidia is growing at a much faster pace than Micron, and it could justify its expensive valuation by sustaining its terrific growth. However, investors looking for a cheaper way to play the AI boom are likely to consider Micron for their portfolios, considering its attractive valuation and the rapid growth it offers right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia's Price Just Keeps Growing -- Is It Headed for a Stock Split?",
        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock looks unstoppable. Amid the company's dominance in artificial intelligence (AI)-ready chips and the insatiable demand for the technology, its stock has risen by close to 300% over the last 12 months.\nWith the stock approaching $1,000 per share, investors may wonder whether a stock split is imminent. Despite the fact that such a move will not directly influence Nvidia's valuation, investors should expect one soon. Here's why.\nThe history of Nvidia stock is arguably the most compelling reason for expecting a near-term split. The company has split its stock five times since 2000, one of which has occurred since AI and data centers renewed investor interest in GPUs.\nThat previous split occurred on July 19, 2021, when Nvidia carried out a 4-for-1 stock split. Interestingly, it closed at a pre-split price of around $744 per share that day, a level lower than today's current price.\nStill, investors should remember that these gains came quickly, as Nvidia stock is up about 85% this year and nearly 30% over the last month alone, indicating that a need for a split could have caught the company's board off guard.\nMoreover, the most significant question surrounding a split is likely where the company will set the split ratio. The most recent 4-for-1 split was the largest ratio in the company's history, with the company having approved three 2-for-1 splits and one 3-for-2 split in the 2000s.\nHowever, as mentioned before, the more recent growth has probably exceeded expectations. While future growth may not match the 126% revenue increase in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31), analysts forecast 81% revenue growth in fiscal 2025 and 22% the next fiscal year, indicating the massive profit increases should continue for the foreseeable future.\nThat could possibly mean the stock price is not done rising. Conversely, slowing growth could soon dampen enthusiasm for the stock, and the company's board will have to consider the massive drops in the stock price in past years. Hence, the company has to be ready for any potential price movement when it decides the split ratio.\nInvestors may want also to consider another possible factor -- inclusion as one of the 30 stocks making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\nThe S&P Dow Jones Indices, operated by S&P Global, has not telegraphed any intention to add Nvidia to the Dow 30. Also, the index already includes two semiconductor stocks, Apple and Intel.\nHowever, Intel has struggled in recent years, increasing the chances of its removal. Also, AI's influence over the economy could lead to more tech stocks in the index, and Nvidia's $2.2 trillion market cap makes it a likely choice.\nFurthermore, the Dow 30 is a price-weighted index. Since the nominal share price determines a stock's weighting on the Dow, companies have often initiated stock splits to reduce their influence over the index. Should Nvidia seek a place on the Dow 30, it may alter the split ratio to increase its chances of inclusion.\nGiven the company's history of stock splits, investors should expect such a move sooner rather than later. Also, since the previous split occurred less than three years ago at a lower price, the split ratio is likely the most significant question surrounding such a move.\nIndeed, Nvidia's board will need to consider the stock's price history in deciding the ratio, both in a positive and negative sense. Also, assuming Nvidia seeks to become a Dow 30 stock, it will have to become more sensitive to its nominal share price.\nUltimately, the stock split changes nothing for Nvidia on the surface. However, given the company's history, shareholders should anticipate a split and, possibly, increased interest in the stock from some unexpected parties.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has continued to climb higher in Monday's trading. The graphics processing unit (GPU) company's share price was up 1% as of 3:15 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. It had been up as much as 5.2% earlier in the day's trading.\nToday marks the beginning of the company's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in San Jose, California, and investors are excited about what the company might discuss and unveil at the event. The conference runs through Thursday and will likely play host to some major news from the artificial intelligence (AI) leader.\nCEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to give a keynote speech later today and host additional panels later in the week, and the conference will also include presentations from other artificial intelligence luminaries, more than 20 technical workshops on generative AI, and hundreds of exhibits. This year's GTC has become a focal point for what's on the horizon for artificial intelligence and other accelerated computing applications, and investors and industry watchers seem to have high expectations.\nNvidia is the world's hottest company, and its stock has been serving up incredible gains. The AI leader's share price has surged roughly 79% higher already in 2024, and it's also up 244% over the last year. The GPU specialist is now valued at roughly $2.21 trillion and ranks as the world's third-most-valuable company, trailing behind only Microsoft and Apple.\nGiven that the AI frontrunner's share price has seen such incredible gains and has already climbed today thanks to excitement about what could be unveiled at GTC, it's not unreasonable to question how much higher the stock can climb in the near term. Whether or not the company's AI announcements at this year's conference measure up to investors' expectations remains to be seen.\nDepending on what is or isn't shown, it's reasonable to expect that Nvidia stock will see some significant movement this week. But long-term investors shouldn't become overly fixated on what's shown and discussed at GTC this week. With Huang recently stating that AI could achieve human-level intelligence within the next five years, the long-term outlook is more exciting.\nNvidia is still in the early stages of benefiting from the artificial intelligence revolution, and the stock continues to look like a worthwhile buy for long-term investors.

        "Text": "One of the most outspoken investors on Wall Street is Cathie Wood, the founder of ARK Invest. Wood is best known for making big bets in emerging areas of technology and healthcare.\nIn a shareholder letter published earlier this month, she suggested that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) could end up like Cisco in the aftermath of the dot-com boom in the early 2000s.\nGiven the meteoric rise in Nvidia's stock price over the last year, it's reasonable to believe a pullback could be on the horizon. But calling for a crash akin to Cisco? That seems dramatic.\nInstead, I think a different \"Magnificent Seven\" stock could be at risk of falling out of favor with investors. Let's dig into why I see Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as much more likely to follow in Cisco's footsteps.\nLatent needs are an interesting concept. Simply put, a latent need is a problem that people don't even realize they have.\nApple is the king of solving latent needs. With the iPod, iMac, iPhone, iPad, and AirPods, the company revolutionized personal computing, communications, and entertainment in ways that people didn't even realize were needed.\nThe company's long list of innovative hardware made it one of the most recognized brands around the world.\nAs investors salivate over all things related to artificial intelligence (AI), Apple is yet again remaining tight-lipped about its plans. I don't think this is the best move after some of the company's flops in recent history.\nGiven how quiet the company has been on the innovation front, I think overcommunicating might be an appropriate strategy right now. Sure, it just shipped its virtual reality (VR) headset, the Vision Pro. But for now, I think people are more intrigued by the idea of VR, rather than the actual use of the technology in their daily lives.\nAfter years of playing coy, news broke earlier this month that the company was abandoning its electric vehicle (EV) ambitions. And big tech cohorts Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft all dominate cloud computing -- a movement that Apple missed entirely.\nApple only recently made headlines in the AI realm following its acquisition of a start-up called DarwinAI. While this deal was interesting, details surrounding how it plans to leverage DarwinAI are sparse.\nBy contrast, Nvidia is aggressively entering new AI markets that it can disrupt. For example, the company is an investor in humanoid robotics start-up Figure AI, as well as a partner with enterprise software platform Databricks.\nAmong mega-cap tech companies, Nvidia is emerging as the front-runner in AI. Demand is soaring for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services.\nIn 2023, Nvidia's revenue increased 126% year over year, while profits and free cash flow grew nearly sixfold. On the other hand, Apple's revenue has been in decline for a year as demand for luxury hardware devices has stalled against the backdrop of a tough economy.\nCisco is one of the most interesting case studies in recent business history. The company was hailed as a leading innovator during the early stages of the internet age. But after competitors began producing similar products, Cisco failed to pivot and move on. Given Nvidia's broad reach across the AI spectrum, I find Wood's comparison to Cisco lacking.\nSure, like Cisco back in the late 1990s, Nvidia stock soared to unprecedented levels. But I think the company's momentum is just getting started. The long-term narrative surrounding AI is encouraging, and right now the chipmaker appears to be the engine powering all sorts of applications.\nBy contrast, Apple stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 26 -- higher than both Meta Platforms and Alphabet as of the time of this writing. It's tough to justify this premium when the company appears to be at a crossroads. It isn't growing, demand for its products is in decline, it abandoned EV's, and it doesn't appear to have any tangible strategy related to AI.\nCould competition ultimately pose a threat to Nvidia? It probably will. But this is why I find the company's investments in robotics and software to be savvy moves. It is clearly exploring markets beyond its core chip business, which will hopefully prove fruitful in the long run.\nGiven the amount of unknowns surrounding Apple, I see the company as an enigma right now. As an investor, I'm not concerned about Nvidia's prospects. But given the lack of innovation from Apple for several years, I think there is a real possibility the company could end up in a situation similar to that of Cisco at some point.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) minted its first $1 trillion company last year when Nvidia stock rose 239% on the back of incredible demand for its AI data center chips. Nvidia is now worth more than $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world behind Microsoft and Apple.\u00a0Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google's parent company) are also members of the $1 trillion club, and each company is working on AI in its own unique way.\nBut I think AI could soon propel Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) to a $1 trillion valuation, too. It operates industry-leading AI data center infrastructure, and the company is building capacity at a record pace because it simply can't keep up with demand. As of this writing, Oracle is valued at $350 billion, so investors who buy the stock today will see roughly a 185% gain if the company joins the $1 trillion club.\nFounded in 1977, Oracle is one of America's oldest technology companies. It developed revolutionary database management software back then, before helping its business customers prepare for the internet age in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The company created Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in 2016 and has since delivered hundreds of digital services to those businesses to migrate their operations online.\nNow, using Nvidia's latest graphics processing units (GPUs), Oracle is focused on delivering the best data center infrastructure for AI workloads. Three months ago, Oracle told investors it was expanding 66 of its existing data center regions and building 100 more to meet demand.\nChairman Larry Ellison says Oracle's GPU cluster technology allows businesses to develop generative AI models twice as fast and for half the cost of other cloud providers. As a result, demand for its latest Gen2 Cloud capacity is skyrocketing. Oracle is able to keep costs down because its data centers rely on automation, which means there is little difference in operating costs between running 10 data centers and running 100. That also enables the company to build and scale them quickly.\nIn a conference call with investors for the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Feb. 29), CEO Safra Catz said Oracle has at least 40 new AI bookings worth more than $1 billion each that haven't even come online yet.\u00a0In other words, they are waiting for additional infrastructure to be built.\nOracle generated $13.3 billion in total revenue during Q3, representing a year-over-year increase of 7%. While that sounds like a sluggish growth rate, revenue for OCI surged 49% to $1.8 billion, and revenue for Gen2 Cloud specifically (within OCI) grew by 53%.\nWhile OCI only accounts for 13.5% of Oracle's total revenue right now, those growth rates will ensure it becomes a much larger piece of the pie in the near future.\nOracle's total AI bookings across its business topped a record $80 billion in Q3, marking a 29% increase from the year-ago period. As you can see, bookings grew four times faster than the company's revenue during the quarter, which is evidence of the enormous demand for computing capacity the company is struggling to fill.\nAt the bottom line, Oracle's Q3 earnings per share jumped 25% to $0.85, which also outpaced revenue growth. It was thanks, in part, to careful cost management, with operating expenses increasing just 4% year over year. But it was also thanks to a substantial increase in gross profit margin on the infrastructure side, which is a natural consequence of scale. Oracle expects continued improvement as more of its new data centers come online.\nAI is the main point of focus for Oracle at the moment, but there's another opportunity worth mentioning. The company now has two Oracle Alloy data center regions online, which organizations can use to deliver their own cloud services to their customers -- without having to manage the infrastructure.\nOracle has planned five more Alloy data center regions, meaning capacity could soon triple. It's just another example of this company's long-standing commitment to innovation.\nAccording to Wall Street, Oracle is on track to generate $53.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending May 31), placing its stock at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.6. That falls between the valuations of other cloud giants, like Amazon (P/S ratio of 3.1) and Microsoft (P/S ratio of 13.2).\nAssuming Oracle's P/S ratio remains constant, the company would have to generate $151.5 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation. It could get there within a decade if its revenue grows by 11% annually.\nWhile Oracle is growing more slowly on a quarterly basis right now, its revenue increased by 22% last fiscal year. Plus, Ellison believes OCI revenue will increase by more than 50% for years to come, which could drive an acceleration in the company's top line overall as the segment grows larger.\nRemember, Oracle is in the process of more than doubling its data center footprint, and its bookings just soared by 29% in a single quarter. Bookings are expected to convert into revenue eventually, implying revenue growth will likely accelerate in the near future.\nAI is the greatest financial opportunity Oracle has ever pursued, and I think it's the company's ticket to a $1 trillion valuation within the next 10 years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is Super Micro Computer a Better AI Stock than Nvidia?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Since the calendar flipped to 2024, there have been few stocks better than Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). The stock nearly tripled over two months, and its performance since the start of 2023 has also been impressive, rising around 900% in total.\nIn that time, few companies come close to matching the performance of Super Micro Computer (often called Supermicro), including artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouse Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). But does that make Supermicro a better AI stock than Nvidia?\nUsing the term \"better\" when comparing stocks is too broad to be analytically useful. It can mean comparing past performance, future prospects, or the underlying business. I'll look at all three factors to determine if Supermicro is better than Nvidia.\nEven though Nvidia is a strong performer, Supermicro's stock rise since 2023 blows Nvidia out of the water. So if we're talking about past performance, Supermicro takes the cake. Knowing this tidbit of information doesn't do you much good unless you have a time machine, though. Instead, I'll focus on the underlying business and potential future stock performance.\nSupermicro and Nvidia are closely tied. Both companies benefited from the rise of AI through their primary product lines. While Nvidia makes top-notch graphics processing units (GPUs) that are used to power AI workloads, Supermicro makes the servers that these GPUs go into to be efficiently used. While some of the larger tech firms have staff to help design the computing architecture, many do not. So smaller companies use Supermicro's highly customizable servers to meet their computing needs.\nThis makes me prefer Nvidia, as it controls the more desirable product. With Nvidia's GPUs in a class of their own in terms of AI computing power, customers have few choices to turn to if they want something different. Supermicro has competitors like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, so Nvidia's path to success is a little clearer.\nAdditionally, this allows Nvidia to have more control over its pricing, which plays out in its margin profile.\nWith Nvidia's gross profit and net income margin much higher than Supermicro's, it can absorb pricing changes without fully losing profitability.\nThis alone makes me prefer Nvidia to Supermicro. But what about future prospects?\nRegarding valuation, Nvidia is cheaper than Supermicro despite its better business position.\nOne area in which Supermicro will pass Nvidia is its revenue growth rate. Although Nvidia expects an impressive 234% growth rate in Q1 FY 2025, this will soon slow. After Q1, Nvidia starts to overlap quarters where GPU demand was incredibly high, so its growth rate will slow even though the company is still doing well.\nHowever, Supermicro's growth is just starting to reach these levels, as its growth projections for Q3 FY 2024 (ending March 31) are anywhere from 188% to 219%. But even though Supermicro's growth rate is starting to accelerate, it doesn't mean it's a cheap stock --\u00a0especially when we utilize its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which considers analyst growth projections.\nSo while Supermicro will continue to put up flashy numbers, I think Nvidia is the better buy here. With the stock being cheaper and having a stronger underlying business model, it's still the king of AI investments. That's not to say Supermicro is a bad company; it's that the stock has gotten too expensive for what it is.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

But Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang wants privileged Gen Z grads to lower their expectations.\n\u201cPeople with very high expectations have very low resilience\u2014and unfortunately, resilience matters in success,\u201d Huang said during a recent interview with the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cOne of my great advantages is that I have very low expectations.\u201d\nIndeed, as the billionaire boss pointed out, those at elite institutions like Stanford probably have higher expectations for their future than your average Joe.\nThe university is one of the most selective in the United States\u2014it ranks third best in the country, according to the QS World University Rankings, and the few students who get picked to study there are charged $62,484 in tuition fees for the premium, compared to the average $26,027 per annum cost.\nBut, unfortunately for those saddled with student debt, not even the best universities in the world can teach you resilience.\n\u201cI don't know how to teach it to you except for I hope suffering happens to you,\u201d Huang added.\nHuang\u2019s advice for America\u2019s next-gen elite comes from a place of experience: His life now is a world away from his childhood, which was, by his own admission, steeped in adversity.\nThe tech genius\u2014who with a net worth of $80 billion is one of the world's wealthiest people\u2014was born in Taiwan in 1963 and spent the bulk of his early life in Thailand, before moving to the U.S. at 9 years old.\nHis serendipitous Stateside move came after his dad, who worked for an air conditioner manufacturer, did some training in the country and set his sights on the American Dream. \n\u201cI was fortunate that I grew up with my parents providing a condition for us to be successful on the one hand,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there were plenty of opportunities for setbacks and suffering.\u201d\nOne example of Huang\u2019s hardship was his daily high school experience: The teenager had to cross a dangerous footbridge with missing planks over a river to get to his public school in Kentucky, where he was then relentlessly tormented.\n\u201cThe way you described Chinese people back then was \u2018Ch-nks,\u2019 \u201d Huang previously told the New Yorker, adding that bullies even tried to toss him off the bridge.\nIn the Stanford interview, he also credited his success and work ethic with his first job at Denny\u2019s, where he was the \u201cbest dishwasher\u201d before getting promoted to busboy and giving that his \u201cbest\u201d also.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXLBTBBil2U\n\u201cI never left the station empty-handed. I never came back empty-handed. I was very efficient,\u201d Huang added. \u201cAnyways, eventually I became a CEO. I\u2019m still working on being a good CEO.\u201d\nCoincidentally, it was at Denny\u2019s where he cooked up the idea for a company that specialized in computer chips to render graphics, over a Super Bird sandwich with his friends Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. The trio went on to cofound Nvidia, and the rest is history.\nFor those fortunate enough to never have personally experienced hardship growing up, Huang doesn\u2019t have any advice on how to welcome more of it into your life now. But he did have some advice on embracing tough times.\n\u201cI don't know how to do it [but] for all of you Stanford students, I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering,\u201d Huang said. \u201cGreatness comes from character and character isn't formed out of smart people\u2014it's formed out of people who suffered.\u201d\nIt\u2019s why despite Nvidia\u2019s success\u2014the company has a $2 trillion market cap\u2014Huang would still welcome hardship at his organization.\n\u201cTo this day I use the phrase 'pain and suffering' inside our company with great glee,\u201d he added. \u201cI mean that in a happy way because you want to refine the character of your company.\u201d\nEssentially, if you want your workforce to always be on their A game, don\u2019t let them rest on their laurels.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Stocks ended the week with a thud, closing down on Friday, as investors pulled back after February's job report and market powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) had a rare off-day.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 0.7% after logging another record close on Thursday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed 0.2%, with losses pared by a pop in Apple (AAPL) shares. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost 1.2% after a sharp gain the previous day. Shares of Nvidia fell more than 5% after a record-breaking hot streak.\nFriday's non-farm payrolls report showed the US economy added 275,000 jobs in February, once again zooming past Wall Street expectations. However, the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9%, its first increase in four months. Futures on the three major averages were trading in red figures ahead of the jobs data. The report bolstered investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut rates following its June meeting, but the momentum fizzled by the end of the trading day.\nShowing how the wind is blowing elsewhere, policymakers from the European Central Bank lined up to support a rate cut before their summer break as inflation falls faster than expected. Meanwhile, Bank of Japan officials are said to be warming to the idea of finally lifting rates out of the negative zone.\nOn the corporate front, Costco (COST) shares fell 7% after its quarterly sales miss overshadowed an earnings beat. Broadcom's (AVGO) revenue beat and forecast for $10 billion in sales of AI-linked chips failed to impress investors, sending the stock over 6% lower.\nIn commodities, gold futures (GC=F) continued to rally, as spot gold eyed its biggest weekly jump in five months amid optimism for a mid-year Fed rate cut.\nHow high will Nvidia (NVDA) go? Friday's trading session offered an answer, at least temporarily. Wall Street ended the day down as investors took profits and paused what had been a staggering rally for Big Tech names, including the AI chipmaker.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 0.7% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed 0.2%, with losses tempered by Apple's (AAPL) gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost 1.2% after a sharp increase the previous day. Shares of Nvidia fell more than 5%, pausing a hot streak.\nJust as the most influential and popular cryptocurrency set an all-time record \u2014 briefly surpassing $70,000 \u2014 SEC Chair Gary Gensler offered new warnings about cryptocurrencies, saying in an interview with Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger that \"the whole field is rife with abuses and fraud.\"\nInvestors, he added, should be aware that bitcoin is a \"highly speculative, volatile underlying asset.\"\nHis remarks come amid a crypto resurgence. Bitcoin this week reached levels that investors have not seen since the 2021 boom, climbing out from the doldrums of the 2022 crash.\nThe latest rally was sparked by demand from a series of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds that started trading in January after receiving approvals from the SEC.\nGensler voted in favor of those ETFs. On Friday he said of that decision \"I thought it was the most straightforward path forward.\"\nSee the full interview and story here.\nMean-reversion is the trade today, though some will call it \"profit-taking.\" Regardless, some of year's biggest winners like Nvidia (NVDA) and Marvell (MRVL) are down decent amounts as beaten-down stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Etsy (ETSY) are seeing a nice pop.\nApple stock has been particularly weak lately, suffering the biggest drop in Relative Strength Index (RSI) since December 2018. Thursday's close at 21.9 is solidly below the 30 level, which is commonly understood to indicate \"oversold.\"\nWhen a stock becomes deeply oversold like this, it can potentially lead to an interim bottom. (It can work the other way too at highs when a stock is overbought.) But this is not always the case.\nThe above study reveals how Apple stock fared following a close in RSI above 25 after closing below it the prior day.\nThis \"oversold pop\" setup in Apple has caught a few price bottoms precisely \u2014 like June 28, 2013, and Feb. 6, 2018 \u2014 leading to both short- and long-term gains.\nBut, more often than not in the dozen instances this signal has fired since the year 2000, Apple stock bleeds lower in the subsequent days and weeks. The average and median returns are negative in time periods up to one month following the signal.\nNotably, the results get much better as more time passes, with average gains of over 25% one year later and 75% positive results.\nLess than a week after Tesla CEO Elon Musk sued OpenAI, alleging the influential AI startup abandoned its original mission of working for the public good, the company struck back.\nOpenAI published a blog post that revealed a Musk-backed plan to turn the organization into a for-profit entity as early as 2017. The maker of ChatGPT also contends Musk vied for total control over the transformed company.\nMusk argued that OpenAI breached its founding ethos of sharing its tech breakthroughs with the public by becoming a closed-source ally with Microsoft. In shared emails, OpenAI's leaders suggested that, as their technology advances, scientific details should be kept from full public view to guard against bad actors.\nIn the unflattering portrait OpenAI presents, Musk comes off as a bitter ex and a hypocrite. And though the re-heated memes Musk has been sharing and responding to on X about OpenAI needing to change its name are embarrassing cringe content, they also offer a straightforward critique of the company.\nBecause the same evidence OpenAI marshals against Musk undermines the startup's own narrative about democratizing the power of advanced AI tools.\nThat's part of what makes OpenAI's straight-faced mission statement about benefiting humanity and \"helping create broadly distributed benefits\" hard to take seriously.\nA decade ago, tech's big social aims held sway. But in 2024, you don't need a trove of emails to learn that story isn't real.\nThe February jobs report calmed concerns that inflation concerns could keep the Federal Reserve from cutting rates this year.\nThe newly released jobs data released Friday showed the US economy added far fewer jobs in the previous two months than previously believed, and signs of slowing wage growth are beginning to emerge, reports Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer.\nAn uptick in unemployment to 3.9%, in line with its highest level seen in the last two years, bolstered the narrative that the labor market remains resilient but not strong enough to rule out a coming rate cut.\n\"After today\u2019s report, we remain comfortable with our longstanding call for a first rate cut from the Fed in June. The rise in unemployment and easing in wage inflation should make the FOMC a little more confident that the labor market is moving back into balance,\" JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday:\nBitcoin (BTC-USD): The world's largest cryptocurrency reached an all-time high Friday, surpassing $70,000 for the first time, but swiftly climbed down to around $68,000 as some investors locked in their profits. The recent burst of excitement around the digital currency lifted the price to levels not seen since late 2021.\nNvidia (NVDA): The stock at the center of Wall Street's AI excitement pulled back nearly 5% during afternoon trading, as the company's staggering rise takes a breather. In recent months the investor frenzy around the stock has intensified as tech companies who rely on Nividia's technology double down on investment in the rapidly developing field.\nCostco (COST): Shares of the warehouse retailer fell by more than 7% Friday after the company reported mixed second quarter results.\nRivian (RIVN): The all-electric car company rose 2% during afternoon trading after the company unveiled two new lower-priced SUVs. The first of the two, a midsize SUV called the R2, will start at around $45,000, and Rivian plans to ship it in the first half of 2026. The move is designed to attract a broader consumer base, akin to Tesla's Model 3.\nAfter a powerful surge investors are taking a breather, sending stocks mostly lower during afternoon trading on Friday and putting a pause on the tech-led rally.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) trended near the flatline after logging another record close on Thursday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased by close to 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost 0.3% after a sharp gain the previous day.\nRenters across the country can breathe easier this year as an influx of apartment supply pressures rent growth.\nAsking rents for professionally managed apartments inched up just 0.2% in February from the previous year, according to data from RealPage. That's notably lower than the historical average of 0.6% dating back to 2010.\n\u201cMuted rent growth is expected to continue throughout 2024 as supply continues to put downward pressure on rents,\u201d RealPage said in a report.\nAustin was the biggest laggard for rent growth, with a decline of 6.7% annually in February. Meanwhile, Virginia Beach led rent increases, with an uptick of 3.3%.\nWhile strategists have been expecting a slowdown in rents, one inflation gauge, the Consumer Price Index, has shown rents to be sticky. Analysts say this is because there is a lag in the data. February CPI will be released on Tuesday.\nOverall, apartment occupancy remained steady at 94.1% in February, according to RealPage, marking the third consecutive month at this rate.\nRealPage noted that record-high construction activity in the apartment sector poses a challenge to occupancy levels this year, with nearly 962,000 units under construction nationally at the end of 2023 and 672,000 units expected to be completed this year.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) reached an all-time high Friday, surpassing $70,000 for the first time, but swiftly climbed down as some investors locked in their profits.\nThe recent burst of excitement around the world's largest cryptocurrency lifted the price to levels not seen since late 2021. Earlier this week, investors pushed the price to to nearly $69,000, matching the previous high set during the acute phase of the pandemic. But bitcoin tumbled below the $60,000 level again in a matter of hours, highlighting the volatility of the market.\nThe recent trading frenzy reinforced a remarkable comeback for bitcoin following a 2022 crash that created huge losses for investors and triggered the downfall of several big industry players, including cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday:\nRivian (RIVN): The all-electric car company rose 6% during morning trading after the company unveiled two new lower-priced SUVs. The first of the two, a midsize SUV called the R2, will start at around $45,000, and Rivian plans to ship it in the first half of 2026. The move is designed to attract a broader consumer base, akin to Tesla's Model 3.\nCostco (COST): Shares of the warehouse retailer fell sharply Friday after the company reported mixed second quarter results.\nGap (GPS): The clothing company gained 3% Friday after reporting fourth quarter earnings that exceeded expectations for both the top and bottom lines. The latest quarterly results arrive about six months into the tenure of CEO Richard Dickson, whose mandate was to turn the company around.\nBroadcom (AVGO): Shares of the semiconductor manufacturer slipped 3% after reporting first quarter results that topped analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. However, the report was not the blowout many investors had hoped for, sending shares slightly lower.\nWall Street rang in the trading day on a positive note, as stocks climbed higher after the February jobs report showed an increase in the unemployment rate. A slightly weaker jobs market bolsters the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this summer, lifting investor optimism.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was flat. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.3%.\nCostco (COST) being Costco has historically worked very well for investors.\nThe company sells giant $1.50 hot dogs at its foodcourt (they taste great, as you can see below in my 2022 photo with retired CEO Craig Jelinek). In the most recent quarter, an 18% online sales increase was fueled by gold bar demand. I surprisingly found (and bought) two tomahawk steaks from my local Costco a few weeks ago for $40 (about five pounds of meat).\nCostco just does things differently, and it's built into its DNA. The stock has risen in the last five years because members are happy shopping there: +245%.\nSo I wasn't surprised to hear Costco's longtime CFO Richard Galanti (who is retiring soon) reveal it's getting into the sushi business on last night's earnings call:\n\"We recently opened our first fully operated sushi offering in Issaquah, Washington, across the street from our headquarters, with two more planned to open in the very near future. This operation is what we have successfully done for years \u2014 for many years \u2014 and throughout our Asia Costcos and several countries over there. The sushi program has proven to be a category where we can be successful in both quality and price, and we're looking forward to seeing more of that in the future.\"\nSign me up for a California roll, Rich.\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia Invested in SoundHound AI Stock, But Should You?",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) have soared this year after Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) revealed that it had bought shares in the company. The chip giant made a relatively small investment, spending nearly $3.7 million to take a 0.6% stake in the company. The investment was one of five that Nvidia made in tech companies related to artificial intelligence (AI) in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nSo what exactly does SoundHound AI do, and should investors follow in Nvidia's footsteps and invest in the stock?\nBefore Nvidia's investment in the company came to light, SoundHound AI was not exactly well-known. However, the company has relationships with a number of large automobile companies that use its technology to help power their voice assistant technologies. The company's platform is incorporated into devices, such as automobiles, and its AI technology helps voice assistants interact with users in a more natural and conversational manner.\nSoundHound AI's platform, which it calls Houndify, achieves this in two primary ways. First, it uses speech-to-meaning technology, which processes speech in real-time so the device understands its meaning even before the user is done talking. Next, it uses deep-meaning-understanding technology to help understand a user's intent and answer complex questions.\nAn example of its technology at work would be a voice assistant that is able to give hotel recommendations when given a list of variables, such as location, price ranges, amenities, and star ratings.\nThe area in which SoundHound AI has made the most progress selling into is the automotive industry. The company has relationships with over 20 auto brands, including Honda, Jeep, Hyundai, Fiat, Chrysler, and RAM, among others. In conjunction with its fourth-quarter earnings report, it said it won a deal with a prominent U.S.-based EV maker and signed another contract with a large automaker to significantly increase its unit volumes through 2037.\nThe company has also been making big strides in the quick-service restaurant vertical. Its SoundHound for Restaurants voice assistant will take phone orders so employees don't have to answer calls and can instead focus on helping customers. It also has solutions for drive-thrus and kiosks.\nThe company has signed deals with restaurant-focused fintech companies such as Toast and Olo, as well as quick-service chains such as White Castle and Jersey Mike's, among others.\nSoundHound AI's strength in the automobile and restaurant verticals helped it grow its revenue by 47% in 2023 to $45.9 million. Meanwhile, for 2024, it forecast revenue of between $63 million and $77 million, which is nearly 53% growth at the midpoint. It said it was looking for revenue to exceed $100 million in 2025.\nWhile that is solid growth, SoundHound AI's cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog of $661 million is more interesting. This metric represents the potential revenue the company expects to generate over the duration of its signed contracts. Currently, the average duration of its contracted backlog is six and a half years, so much of the revenue from these contracts should be recognized before the end of 2031, although some contracts extend out longer.\nIt's easy to see why Nvidia likes SoundHound, with the company growing quickly and having a large revenue backlog. It also isn't difficult to imagine that SoundHound AI's technology can be applied to other industries as well, which could accelerate its growth.\nThe two companies also recently announced a collaboration where SoundHound AI will offer on-chip voice AI that doesn't need internet connectivity using Nvidia's DRIVE platform. The solution will allow users to access SoundHound AI's Vehicle Intelligence offering, where users can ask auto-specific questions, such as what it means when a dash light is on, as well as general questions, such as finding the best place to eat nearby.\nThat said, with SoundHound stock trading at an over 26x price-to-sales ratio and the company currently unprofitable, the stock is very speculative at this point. Its technology looks impressive, but AI technology is evolving quickly. What could seem like cutting-edge technology today could become commoditized in the future. While its cumulative backlog is impressive, that only equates to about $100 million a year in revenue over the average duration of its contracts, so the company has a long way to grow into its current valuation.\nAs such, I recommend that investors keep their positions small if they want to follow Nvidia into SoundHound AI stock, as they should with Nvidia itself.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

A typical mask set for a chip \u2014 a key step in its production \u2014 could take 30 million or more hours of CPU compute time, necessitating large data centers within semiconductor foundries. With accelerated computing, 350 NVIDIA H100 systems can now replace 40,000 CPU systems, accelerating production time, while reducing costs, space and power.\n\u201cOur work with NVIDIA to integrate GPU-accelerated computing in the TSMC workflow has resulted in great leaps in performance, dramatic throughput improvement, shortened cycle time and reduced power requirements,\u201d said Dr. C.C. Wei, CEO of TSMC. \u201cWe are moving NVIDIA cuLitho into production at TSMC, leveraging this computational lithography technology to drive a critical component of semiconductor scaling.\u201d\nSince its introduction last year, cuLitho has enabled TSMC to open new opportunities for innovative patterning technologies. In testing cuLitho on shared workflows, the companies jointly realized a 45x speedup of curvilinear flows and a nearly 60x improvement on more traditional Manhattan-style flows.

Our collaboration with TSMC and NVIDIA is critical to enabling angstrom-level scaling as we pioneer advanced technologies to reduce turnaround time by orders of magnitude through the power of accelerated computing.\u201d\nSynopsys is the pioneer in delivering advanced techniques for accelerating the performance of computational lithography. Synopsys\u2019 Proteus\u2122 optical proximity correction software running on the NVIDIA cuLitho software library significantly speeds computational workloads compared to current CPU-based methods. With Proteus mask synthesis products, manufacturers like TSMC can achieve exceptional precision, efficiency and speed in proximity correction, model building for correction, and analyzing proximity effects on corrected and uncorrected IC layout patterns, revolutionizing the chip fabrication process.\nBreakthrough Generative AI Support for Computational LithographyNVIDIA has developed algorithms to apply generative AI to further enhance the value of the cuLitho platform. The new generative AI workflow delivers an additional 2x speedup on top of the accelerated processes enabled through cuLitho. The application of generative AI enables creation of a near-perfect inverse mask or inverse solution to account for diffraction of light. The final mask is then derived by traditional and physically rigorous methods, speeding up the overall optical proximity correction (OPC) process by a factor of two.\nMany changes in the fab process currently necessitate a revision in OPC, driving up the amount of compute required and creating bottlenecks in the fab development cycle. These costs and bottlenecks are alleviated with the accelerated computing cuLitho provides and generative AI, enabling fabs to allocate available compute capacity and engineering bandwidth to design more novel solutions in development of new technologies for 2nm and beyond.\nTo learn more, watch Huang\u2019s GTC keynote.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: Here Are 3 Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "Author": "  Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Sure, Nvidia is on fire. Its stock is up an eye-popping 1,980% over the last 5 years -- meaning a $10,000 investment in 2019 would be worth a staggering $208,000 today.\nBut as the saying goes, past performance is no guarantee of future results. So let's consider some alternatives to the king of AI stocks. Here are three names that I think AI-focused investors would be wise to consider.\nFirst up is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Granted, AMD may not have captured the same level of AI buzz as its competitor Nvidia, but the company is similarly benefiting from the AI revolution. Indeed, shares of AMD have soared 179% since January 2023.\nLike Nvidia, AMD designs advanced semiconductors that can be used to train large language models. Its latest AI-focused offering is the MI300X chip, unveiled in December 2023. So far, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta Platforms have all expressed interest in using the chip, which offers an alternative to the current AI workhouse, Nvidia's H100 chip.\nThe MI300X could help AMD secure a key foothold in the AI accelerator market, particularly considering its cost. It sells for around $10,000 to $15,000, well below the H100's price of $40,000.\nWith the first deliveries of the MI300X happening right now, it will take some time to see what the demand for the chip looks like. However, AMD Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lisa Su has expressed optimism, both for the MI300X and the overall AI market. Back in December she predicted that the market for AI chips would hit $400 billion by 2027, up from around $40 billion in 2023. If her prediction is anywhere near accurate, AMD investors will have lots to smile about in the coming years.\nNext up is Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), an under-the-radar AI stock if ever there was one.\nThe company is probably best known for being one of the classic \"tech bubble\" stocks of the early 2000s. The database software giant's stock skyrocketed during the first wave of internet adoption in the late 1990s before crashing 84% in the bear market of 2001-2003.\nNevertheless, Oracle is now back and riding high thanks to its data center business. In its most recent earnings report (for the three months ending on Feb. 29, 2024), Oracle beat expectations, highlighted by:\n$13.3 billion in total revenue, up 7% year-over-year\n$5.1 billion in cloud revenue, up 25% from a year ago\n$2.4 billion in net income, an increase of 27% from a year earlier.\nMoreover, the company raised forward guidance. Indeed, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Safra Catz sounded a very optimistic note, saying that the company is likely to surpass its goal of $65 billion in annual revenue by 2026. Moreover, Chairman Larry Ellison highlighted that soaring spending from hyperscalers like Microsoft is moving Oracle's needle.\nIn short, the AI wave is helping Oracle find its mojo once again -- and investors should take note.\nLast is Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR), the company at the forefront of AI-driven big data analysis.\nSome investors might find Palantir's business model difficult to understand. In a nutshell, Palantir helps organizations run their operations more efficiently. The company does this through multiple AI-powered software platforms that analyze enormous data sets, recognize patterns, and offer solutions.\nFinancially, it's clear Palantir is racking up wins. Its customer count, revenue, net income, and free cash flow are all growing. Moreover, the company is starting to execute a pivot toward the private sector after getting much of its early-stage revenue from government contracts.\nEven now, Palantir generates more revenue from governmental entities ($1.2 billion in 2023) than from commercial customers ($1.0 billion in 2023).\nHowever, that's likely to change. Palantir's commercial revenue is growing at around 20% year over year, while government revenue is growing at 14%. If that trend holds, Palantir's commercial revenue will surpass its government revenue by 2027.\nAt any rate, investors shouldn't sleep on Palantir. The company's rapid growth means that it could become the next big name in the AI investing space.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Hippocratic AI ",
        "Text": "New platform aims to enable an age of healthcare abundance\nPALO ALTO, Calif., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Hippocratic AI announced a collaboration with NVIDIA to develop empathetic AI healthcare agents \u2014 powered by the NVIDIA AI platform \u2013 enabling super-low-latency conversational interactions. User tests repeatedly show that super low latency voice interaction is required for patients to build an emotional connection naturally. Since LLMs run on inference engines, Hippocratic AI has termed this low latency inference: \u201cEmpathy Inference.\u201d The AI healthcare agents are built on Hippocratic\u2019s safety-focused large language model (LLM), the first designed specifically for healthcare. Health systems, payors, digital health companies, and pharma deploy Hippocratic AI\u2019s healthcare agents to augment their human staff and complete low risk, non-diagnostic, patient facing tasks over the phone.\n\u201cWith generative AI, patient interactions can be seamless, personalized, and conversational\u2014but in order to have the desired impact, the speed of inference has to be incredibly fast. With the latest advances in LLM inference, speech synthesis and voice recognition software, NVIDIA\u2019s technology stack is critical to achieving this speed and fluidity,\u201d said Munjal Shah, co-founder and CEO of Hippocratic AI. \u201cWe\u2019re working with NVIDIA to continue refining our technology and amplify the impact of our work of mitigating staffing shortages while enhancing access, equity, and patient outcomes.\u201d\n\u201cVoice-based digital agents powered by generative AI can usher in an age of abundance in healthcare, but only if the technology responds to patients as a human would,\u201d said Kimberly Powell, vice president of Healthcare at NVIDIA. \u201cThis type of engagement will require continued innovation and close collaboration with companies, such as Hippocratic AI, developing cutting-edge solutions.\u201d\nAt NVIDIA GTC, a global AI developer conference, Hippocratic AI and NVIDIA showcased the solution with the NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine suite of technologies, which brings digital humans to life with generative AI.\nHippocratic AI is working with NVIDIA to develop a super-low-latency inference platform to power real-time use cases. According to research conducted by Hippocratic AI, every half second of improvement in inference speed increases the ability for patients to emotionally connect with AI healthcare agents by 5-10% or more. For instance when asked, \u201cDid you feel this AI cared about you?\u201d over 1002 licensed US nurses acting as patients said yes 84.3% of the time when the inference was over 3 seconds but 88.2% yes when inference was 2.2 seconds. When asked, \u201cDo you feel comfortable confiding in this AI?\u201d respondents said yes 80.1% when the end-to-end inference time was over 3 seconds but 88.9% when it was 2.2 seconds.\nAs part of the collaboration, Hippocratic AI will continue to build upon NVIDIA\u2019s low-latency inference stack and enhance conversational AI capabilities using NVIDIA Riva models for automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech translation. The companies will also customize the models for the medical domain. Hippocratic AI will leverage NVIDIA NIM microservices for deployment of these new AI models capabilities to optimize performance and accelerate the pace of innovation.\nIn addition, Hippocratic AI uses NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs to support the development and delivery of its LLM and patient-facing solutions. The company today announced that its generative AI healthcare agents out performed GPT-4 and LLaMA2 70B Chat on a bevy of safety benchmarks.\n\u00a0\nHippocratic AI Constellation\nLLaMA 2 70B Chat\nOpen AI GPT-4\nHuman nurses\nIdentify medication impact on lab values (only MoA)\n79.61%\n0.00%\n74.22%\n63.40%\nIdentify condition-specific disallowed OTCs\n88.73%\n30.66%\n55.54%\n45.92%\nCorrectly compare lab value to reference range\n96.43%\n48.24%\n77.89%\n93.74%\nDetect toxic OTC dosages\n81.50%\n9.11%\n38.06%\n57.64%\nThese successful benchmarks are the result of Hippocratic AI\u2019s unique three-part approach to safety, comprised of: (1) a 70B-100B primary model trained using evidence-based content; (2) a novel constellation architecture with multiple models totaling over one trillion parameters, in which the primary LLM is supervised by multiple specialist support models to improve medical accuracy and substantially reduce hallucinations (more on this architecture in Hippocratic\u2019s paper); (3) built-in guardrails that bring in a human supervisor when necessary.\nHippocratic has engaged more than 40 beta partners to conduct rigorous internal tests of its initial AI healthcare agents, which focus on chronic care management, wellness coaching, health risk assessments, social determinants of health surveys, pre-operative outreach, and post-discharge follow-up.\nTo learn more about Hippocratic AI, visit www.HippocraticAI.com or tune into Munjal Shah\u2019s upcoming session at NVIDIA GTC on Wednesday, March 20 at 10:30 a.m. PT.

        "Author": "  Anna Tong and Stephen Nellis ",
        "Text": "By Anna Tong and Stephen Nellis\nSAN JOSE (Reuters) - Nvidia on Monday unveiled software aimed at making it easier for businesses to incorporate artificial intelligence systems into their work, broadening the chipmaker's offerings.\nThe release highlights Nvidia's push to expand its presence in the AI application execution sector, called inference, where the company's chips don't dominate the market, said Joel Hellermark, CEO of Sana, a maker of AI assistants for companies.\nNvidia is best known for providing the chips used to train so-called foundation models like OpenAI's GPT-4. Training involves ingesting large amounts of data and is done mostly by AI-focused and large tech companies.\nNow, companies of all sizes are scrambling to incorporate those foundation models into their work, which can be complicated. The Nvidia tools released on Monday are designed to make it easier to modify and run various AI models on Nvidia hardware.\n\"It's like buying a ready-made meal rather than going out and purchasing ingredients yourself,\" said Ben Metcalfe, a venture capitalist who founded Monochrome Capital.\n\"The Googles and Doordashes and Ubers, they can do all of this themselves, but now that Nvidia has more GPUs available they need to enable more companies to get value out of GPUs,\" he said. Those less tech-savvy companies can use the \"prepared recipes\" to get their systems up, he said.\nFor example, ServiceNow, a firm that provides software for use by technical support staff inside big businesses, said it used Nvidia's tools to create a \"copilot\" to help solve corporate IT problems.\nNvidia has some big-name partners for the new tools: Microsoft, Alphabet Inc's Google and Amazon will offer them as part of their cloud computing services, and Google, Cohere, Meta and Mistral are among companies offering models. But OpenAI, its financial backer Microsoft and Anthropic, two of the largest providers of foundation models, are notably missing from the list.\nNvidia's tools offer a potential revenue boost for the chipmaker: They are part of its existing software suite that costs $4,500 a year for each Nvidia chip if used on in a private data center or $1 per hour in a cloud data center.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Jose and Anna Tong in San Francisco; editing by Peter Henderson and Leslie Adler)\n"

        "Author": "  Sydney Lake ",
        "Text": "Jensen Huang was once Denny\u2019s \u201cbest dishwasher.\u201d\n\u201cI planned my work. I was organized. I was mise en place,\u201d Huang said during a recent interview with Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cI washed the living daylights out of those dishes.\u201d\nNow he\u2019s beating the living daylights out of the competition as president and CEO of Nvidia, the world\u2019s premiere advanced chip manufacturer. He\u2019s now worth nearly $82 billion, and the company he cofounded has a $2 trillion market cap.\nBut Huang attributes his wild success in business to the work ethic he picked up during his time with Denny\u2019s as a dishwasher, before he was \u201cpromoted\u201d to busboy.\n\u201cI never left the station empty-handed. I never came back empty-handed. I was very efficient,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnyways, eventually I became a CEO. I'm still working on being a good CEO.\u201d\nHuang was born in Taiwan in 1963, moved to Thailand at age 5, and moved to Washington State in the U.S. when he was 9. He went to high school outside of Portland, Ore., where he started working for Denny\u2019s at age 15, according to an Nvidia blog post. Huang then earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University, then went on to get his master\u2019s in the same subject from Stanford University in 1992.\nNot only did Huang land his first job at Denny\u2019s\u2014but it\u2019s also the place where he and two of his friends cooked up the idea that would make him a billionaire. In 1993, Huang, along with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem (who both worked at Sun Microsystems), met at what was one of Denny\u2019s \u201cmost popular\u201d locations in Northern California to discuss \u201ccreating a chip that would enable realistic 3D graphics on personal computers,\u201d according to the Nvidia blog post.\n\u201cChris and Curtis said one day they\u2019d like to leave [Sun Microsystems], and they\u2019d like me to go figure out what they\u2019re going to leave for,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThey insisted I figure out with them how to build a company.\u201d But with little runway on how to build a business, Huang said he resolved to visit a bookstore to find books on starting a business and found one titled How to Write a Business Plan by Gordon Bell. But the issue was the book was 450 pages long.\n\u201cWell, I never got through it. And not even close,\u201d Huang said. \u201cI flipped through a few pages and I go, \u2018You know what, by the time I\u2019m done reading this thing, I\u2019ll be out of business.\u201d So with that, Huang took to a Denny\u2019s booth with his two friends to brainstorm a business.\nAt the time, Huang was working as an engineer with LSI Logic, a company in Santa Clara, Calif., that sold semiconductors and software. Avago Technologies acquired LSI Logic for $6.6 billion in 2014. But Huang kind of skips over that part when he\u2019s telling his career story.\n\u201cMy first job before CEO was a dishwasher,\u201d Huang said in the Stanford interview. \u201cAnd I did that very well.\u201d\nWhile at Denny\u2019s that fateful night, Huang, Malachowsky, and Priem \u201cpolished off a Lumberjack Slam, Moons Over My Hammy, and a Super Bird sandwich\u2014washed down with plenty of coffee,\u201d according to Nvidia, the perfect fuel for masterminding a new technology. Now there\u2019s a booth dedicated to Huang at an East San Jose Denny\u2019s location.\n\u201cThe PC revolution was just getting going,\u201d Huang said in the Stanford interview. \u201cWe thought, why don't we build a company that solves problems that a normal computer that is powered by general purpose computing can't. That became the company's mission.\u201d Some of the industries \u201copened up,\u201d Huang said, as a result of Nvidia\u2019s technology, include computational drug design, weather simulation, materials design, robotics, self-driving cars\u2014and the big one: artificial intelligence.\nNvidia\u2019s technology \u201cenabled a whole new way of developing software where the computer wrote the software itself\u2014artificial intelligence as we know it today,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThat was the journey.\u201d\nWhile Nvidia has undoubtedly been developing the technology fueling the AI revolution, it had done so relatively quietly until just about a month ago. But in mid-February, its 46% stock surge pushed it past Amazon, adding about $560 billion in market value. Then Nvidia beat out Alphabet to become the third most valuable U.S. company. But there are some skeptics who think Nvidia may be overvalued. Apollo Global Management said that Nvidia\u2019s inflated earnings are creating an AI bubble even \u201cbigger than the 1990s tech bubble.\u201d\nBut even as successful as Nvidia becomes, Huang consistently reflects on his humble beginnings. He tries to maintain a very flat structure at his company and lends a helping hand where he can. He says (counter to conventional business wisdom) that a CEO should have the most direct reports; he has 50.\n\u201cNo task is beneath me,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to be a dishwasher. I used to clean toilets. I cleaned a lot of toilets. I've cleaned more toilets than all of you combined. And some of them you just can't unsee.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "3 Healthcare Stocks That Have Outperformed Nvidia Since 2022",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech giant Nvidia has been one of the hottest stocks over the past couple of years, with its shares more than doubling since 2022. But technology isn't the only place where investors can find excellent investments. \nIn fact, three healthcare stocks that have outperformed Nvidia since 2022 are TransMedics Group (NASDAQ: TMDX), Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), and Verona Pharma (NASDAQ: VRNA). Here's a look at how well these stocks have performed, why they have fared so well, and whether they're still good buys today.\nTransMedics is a fairly small medical device company with a market capitalization of $2.5 billion. The company has developed an organ care platform for which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval; it can transport multiple organs. It's the only multi-organ platform that regulators have approved. It can improve patient outcomes and be a game changer for the business.\nThe business has been making significant progress in growing its top line over the years, and TransMedics continues to generate impressive numbers. On Monday, the company reported its 2023 fourth-quarter results, and revenue totaling $81.2 million was up 159% year over year. TransMedics also posted a profit of $4 million. For 2024, TransMedics expects its full-year revenue to grow by around 50%, totaling between $360 million and $370 million.\nWith a lot more growth still on the horizon, it may not be too late to invest in the healthcare stock despite its already impressive gains.\nEli Lilly has become the largest healthcare stock in the world after nearly tripling in value since 2022. The big reason for its recent success is tirzepatide, the active ingredient in both Mounjaro, its diabetes drug, and Zepbound, its approved treatment for weight loss. In clinical trials, tirzepatide has helped people lose an astonishing 26.6% of their body weight when patients made significant lifestyle changes while also using the drug.\nThe hype surrounding anti-obesity treatments has been the catalyst behind its rally over the past couple of years, as Eli Lilly truly has a game changer on its hands. Analysts believe that tirzepatide could generate at least $68 billion in annual revenue at its peak. Just how high that number ends up will depend on what other indications it may get approved for. In clinical trials, tirzepatide has helped treat fatty liver disease, and similar drugs have been associated with helping to reduce the cardiovascular risk for obese people.\nThere could still be a lot more upside for Eli Lilly's stock simply due to the opportunity for tirzepatide. Although the stock looks expensive, trading at well over 100 times earnings, that doesn't mean it has peaked; Eli Lilly may very well be the first healthcare stock to reach a $1 trillion valuation.\nPharmaceutical company Verona Pharma rounds out this list with gains of 156% since 2022. It's the riskiest stock on this list as it doesn't have an approved product just yet, but it's close to the finish line with ensifentrine. The FDA is currently reviewing the company's application for it in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a PDUFA date has been set for June 26.\nThe $1.4 billion stock could have a lot more room to run if regulators give the drug the green light as it could be a blockbuster, with analysts projecting that at its peak, it could bring in $1.5 billion in annual revenue.\nWithout approval, however, Verona will continue to incur losses and burn through cash as it doesn't have an approved product to rely on for consistent revenue. But with ensifentrine showing encouraging results in clinical trials, there's hope that approval will happen this year.\nIf you're not OK with taking on some considerable risk, however, you may want to wait on the sidelines with Verona Pharma stock as it's by no means a sure thing; if regulators push back on the treatment and don't end up approving it, that could lead to a sharp sell-off.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Nvidia (NVDA). Shares have added about 16.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NVIDIA due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\nNVIDIA reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results and provided strong guidance for the first quarter.\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, NVIDIA reported non-GAAP earnings of $5.16 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.4%. Moreover, the reported figure soared a whopping 486% year over year while increasing 28% sequentially. The robust increase in earnings was mainly driven by higher revenues and improvement in gross margin.\nFiscal fourth-quarter revenues more than tripled on a year-over-year basis and climbed 22% sequentially to $22.1 billion. The robust growth in the top line was mainly driven by record sales in the Data Center end market and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets following the normalization of channel inventory. The top line also beat the consensus mark of $20.31 billion.\nNVIDIA reports revenues under two segments \u2014 Graphics and Compute & Networking.\nGraphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and personal computers, the GeForce NOW game-streaming service and related infrastructure. The segment also offers solutions for gaming platforms, Quadro GPUs for enterprise design, GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.\nGraphics accounted for 19% of fiscal fourth-quarter revenues. The segment\u2019s top line soared 77% year over year while increasing 21% sequentially to $4.21 billion. Our fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimate for the Graphics segment was pegged at $4.19 billion.\nCompute & Networking represented 81% of fiscal fourth-quarter revenues. The segment comprises Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, the DRIVE development platform for autonomous vehicles and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.\nCompute & Networking revenues soared 387% year over year and 22% sequentially to $17.9 billion. Our fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimate for this segment was pegged at $15.88 billion.\nBased on the market platform, Gaming revenues increased 56% year over year and were flat sequentially at $2.87 billion, accounting for 13% of the total revenues. The year-over-year surge reflects increased sales to channel partners following the normalization of inventory and increased sales of its GeForce RTX 40 SUPER series family of GPUs (graphics processing units). Our estimate for the Gaming end-market\u2019s fourth-quarter revenues was pegged at $2.83 billion.\nRevenues from Data Center (83.3% of revenues) jumped 409% year over year and 27% from the previous quarter to $18.4 billion. This robust rise was mainly driven by higher shipments of the Hopper GPU computing platform used for the training and inference of large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications, along with InfiniBand end-to-end solutions.\nNVIDIA witnessed strong demand for its chips used in datacenter by enterprise software and consumer Internet applications, and multiple industry verticals, including automotive, financial services and healthcare. During the fiscal fourth quarter, large cloud providers represented more than half of Data Center revenues. Additionally, Data Center sales to China declined significantly in the quarter due to the U.S. government licensing requirements.\nThe segment also experienced traction from its Cloud Service Provider (CSP) customer base both in Hyperscale and GPU-specialized CSPs globally. Our estimate for this end-market\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues was pegged at $16.43 billion.\nProfessional Visualization revenues (2.1% of revenues) increased 105% year over year and 11% sequentially to $416 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher sell-in to partners following inventory normalization while the sequential increase was driven by the ramp of desktop workstations based on the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture. Our estimate for the Professional Visualization end-market\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues was pegged at $433.3 million.\nAutomotive sales (1.3% of revenues) in the reported quarter totaled $281 million, down 4% on a year-over-year basis but up 8% sequentially. The sequential rise was mainly driven by self-driving platforms.\u00a0 Our estimate for this end-market\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues was pegged at $294.5 million.\nOEM and Other revenues (0.3% of revenues) were up 7% year over year and 23% sequentially to $90 million. Our fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimate for this end market was pegged at $84.8 million.\nNVIDIA\u2019s non-GAAP gross margin increased to 76.7% from 66.1% in the year-ago quarter and 75% from the previous quarter, mainly driven by higher Data Center sales and benefits from favorable component costs.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses increased 25% year over year and 9% sequentially to $2.21 billion. The increase was due to higher compensations and related benefits. However, as a percentage of total revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses declined to 10% from 29.3% in the year-ago quarter and 11.2% in the previous quarter.\nThe non-GAAP operating income jumped 563% year over year and 28% sequentially to $14.75 billion, primarily driven by higher revenues, along with an improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales.\nAs of Jan 28, 2024, NVDA\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $25.98 billion, up from $18.28 billion as of Oct 29, 2023. As of Jan 28, 2024, the total long-term debt was $8.46 billion, almost flat with $8.45 billion at the end of the third quarter.\nNVIDIA generated $11.5 billion in operating cash flow, up from the year-ago quarter\u2019s $2.25 billion and the previous quarter\u2019s $7.33 billion. In fiscal 2024, it generated an operating cash flow of $28.09 billion, up from $5.64 billion in fiscal 2023.\nThe company ended the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 with free cash flow of $11.22 billion and $26.95 billion, respectively.\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, the company returned $99 million to shareholders through dividend payouts and repurchased stocks worth $2.8 billion. In fiscal 2024, the company paid out $395 million in dividends and bought back stocks worth $9.5 billion.\nIn the quarter, it had a remaining share-repurchase authorization of approximately $22.44 billion, which has no expiration time.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, NVIDIA anticipates revenues of $24 billion (+/-2%). The GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are projected at 73.6% and 77%, respectively (+/-50 bps). GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated at $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.\nGAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, are anticipated to be an income of approximately $250 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter is estimated at 17% (+/- 1%).\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\nIt turns out, estimates review have trended upward during the past month.\nThe consensus estimate has shifted 16.49% due to these changes.\nVGM Scores\nAt this time, NVIDIA has a nice Growth Score of B, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "Title": "Can Nvidia Rally 21% and Surpass Apple to Become the Second Most Valuable \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock?",
        "Author": "  Daniel Foelber, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "March 8 was a wild day in the stock market. Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged to an all-time high of $974 only to fall over 10% from that high to end the day at $875.28. At the peak, Nvidia was less than 9% away from surpassing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in market cap. By close, it was a little over 20% away.\nGiven Nvidia's big swings, it seems like the stock could very well surpass Apple to become the second most valuable \"Magnificent Seven\" stock behind Microsoft. Here's why Nvidia could keep outperforming Apple in the short term, but why Apple is the better long-term buy.\nNvidia is not an unprofitable growth stock that is rallying based on optimism and greed alone (although those are contributing factors). The business is doing phenomenally well, achieving a level of sales and earnings growth paired with margin expansion.\nThe only concern with Nvidia is its valuation. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio based on its trailing 12-month (TTM) earnings is 73.6. But consensus analyst estimates expect Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) to more than double from the $11.90 it earned in fiscal 2024 to $24.50 in fiscal 2025. That gives Nvidia a forward P/E of 35.7 -- which is far more reasonable.\nThe easiest way for Nvidia to pass Apple in market cap is for investors to keep bidding up the stock. But the more realistic way is if Nvidia's earnings live up to expectations.\nNvidia will report its full-year fiscal 2025 results some time in late February or early March next year. If it reports $24.50 in earnings, the stock would likely be far higher, especially if there is optimism for even more growth ahead. A business that is more than doubling earnings with high margins and leading the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution deserves a premium valuation, probably something like double the P/E of the S&P 500.\nNvidia deserves the highest P/E of all the Magnificent Seven companies, but the company is nearing a point where it is running up too far, too fast.\nNvidia benefited from earnings growth and a valuation expansion. It's hard to assume the valuation will continue to expand, but the stock could still go up if the first half of fiscal 2025 goes as analysts expect. Each new quarter of high earnings will increase the trailing-12-month number and lower the P/E, leaving room for the stock to rise to fill the gap. There is nothing better in the stock market than earnings growth, and right now Nvidia has it, and Apple doesn't.\nSo why is Apple the better buy if Nvidia has such an easy path forward? Simply put, I think the setup for Apple makes it a much better investment. Nvidia may be the better trade, but a more surefire way of building wealth is by compounding over the long term.\nMarket sentiment is negative toward Apple. So negative, in fact, that Apple trades at a discount to the S&P 500. The only reason that should ever happen is if something serious was going wrong with Apple. The company has its challenges, but none of them warrant an underperformance like we have been seeing for the last six months or so.\nThe abridged version of why Apple stock is under pressure is because it hasn't captured the spotlight with some major AI monetization announcement (Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms have). iPhone sales are down in China, and growth is sluggish in general. But Apple has endured these periods before and overcome competition.\nPiper Sandler's fall 2023 survey found that 87% of Gen Z had an iPhone, 88% expected their next phone to be an iPhone, and 34% owned an Apple Watch. The\u00a0iPhone is essentially a consumer staple in the U.S. and is growing well across international markets outside of China.\nInvestors should focus less on the competition and more on Apple's ability to further monetize its existing devices through services and AI. The key for Apple has always been to increase the depth (services) and breadth (more products like phones, computers, tablets, wearables, ear buds, and more) of its ecosystem. Having lifetime customers consistently increase their spending relies on product improvements.\nThe pressure is on Apple to make a splash this summer to drive iPhone demand and upgrades. If Apple delivers the improvements that drive growth, the stock could soar. But even if it doesn't, it generates plenty of extra cash to make an acquisition and grow that way, or return cash to shareholders while maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet.\nApple's brand, market position, and financial health give it the time and the wiggle room needed to make mistakes. The company is known for not leading investors on and only makes announcements when it feels the product or service is ready.\nNvidia has to hit sky-high earnings forecasts to keep going up. The semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical, and a downturn in customer spending could stall its growth trajectory. Nvidia may keep growing at a breakneck pace in the near term, but eventually, it will slow down. When that time comes, investors may be less willing to give Nvidia a multiple that is triple the market average.\nMeanwhile, Apple is already a good value and has a clear path toward regaining Wall Street's favor.\nI don't have a crystal ball, but if I had to guess, I would say Nvidia will briefly become more valuable than Apple. But three to five years from now, I think Apple will be worth more than Nvidia while also being a safer and less volatile investment.\nNvidia stands out as a high-risk/high-potential-reward play, while Apple is more like a low-risk/medium-potential-reward investment. Investors who are confident about sustained high demand for Nvidia's products will want to watch each quarterly earnings report, understanding the importance earnings play in the story. The big gains have already been made in Nvidia, and investors should expect more reasonable returns going forward.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) played a major in the Nasdaq Composite's 43% return last year. Indeed, investor enthusiasm for AI has carried over into 2024 -- helping fuel the S&P 500 to record levels.\nWhile each member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is playing a role in AI development, several companies in this cohort also share a more specific interest in voice-recognition software. Let's break down the various moves megacap tech has made in speech-powered AI assistants, and assess one stock in particular that could be set for liftoff.\nWhether you realize it or not, you probably interact with voice-based assistants almost every day.\nApple acquired AI-assistant Siri back in 2010 and has since integrated the technology across its ecosystem of hardware devices. More recently, Cupertino bought the music recognition app Shazam for $400 million.\nBoth Alphabet and Amazon have also shown a keen interest in voice-recognition applications, as each company's smart home appliances leverage this technology. Moreover, Microsoft acquired conversational AI tool Nuance a couple of years ago for $20 billion -- the third-largest acquisition in the software giant's history.\nBut most recently, semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia revealed that it has built a small stake in voice-recognition software developer SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). Following the news of Nvidia's investment, SoundHound AI stock rocketed higher -- the stock gained 347% in the month of February.\nI find this deal with Nvidia particularly delightful because in early January, I predicted that SoundHound AI may be a stock to keep your eyes on in 2024. My thesis primarily hinged on two ideas: voice-based software tools could become increasingly popular as use cases for AI continue to evolve, since voice controls can make AI tools easier to use. Furthermore, the market's appetite for acquisitions could rise this year.\nSince SoundHound AI's trailing-12-month revenue is only $46 million, the company is still quite small. But with cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog of $661 million, it's clear that the demand for voice-powered AI is rising -- and it's not all coming from big tech.\nConsidering that industry research sees the market for voice-recognition technology reaching $50 billion by the end of the decade, it appears to be early innings for SoundHound AI. While the stock has some momentum pushing it higher right now, this little-known AI company could emerge as a big winner in the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Nvidia Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.NVIDIA\u2019s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company\u2019s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.NVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company\u2019s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company\u2019s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.Santa Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024, up 126% from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023.Beginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments \u2013 Graphics and Compute & Networking.Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.Compute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.Graphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 22% and 78% of fiscal 2024 revenues, respectively.\nBottom Line\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Nvidia, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\nA $1000 investment made in March 2014 would be worth $197,163.86, or a gain of 19,616.39%, as of March 18, 2024, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\nThe S&P 500 rose 177.93% and the price of gold increased 51.71% over the same time frame in comparison.\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for NVDA.\nNVIDIA's Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. The stock has outperformed the industry year to date. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\nThe stock is up 20.97% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 15 higher, for fiscal 2024. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "Title": "Nvidia's GTC was CEO Jensen Huang's big moment",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang might as well have pitched a flag in the ground during his keynote at the company\u2019s GTC conference on Monday, declaring that the chip giant is not only the go-to AI firm of today, but also the key for tech\u2019s future.\nOver the course of the two-hour presentation, the CEO rattled off a raft of new Nvidia technologies, including its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture, to a crowd so large it packed the rafters of San Jose\u2019s SAP Center.\nI\u2019ve been to my fair share of tech events over the years, and this was the first time in quite a while that attendees gave off an overwhelming sense of excitement and anticipation for what was to come.\nHuang used the moment as a victory lap for Nvidia, going over how the company went from a video game powerhouse to an AI darling. He extolled the virtues and opportunities of generative AI, recalled how Nvidia\u2019s early investments helped kick off the modern AI race in 2012, and noted how it\u2019s powering the conversation today.\nThose investments have indeed paid off in the form of massive sales increases. In its last fiscal quarter, Nvidia reported data center revenue of $18.4 billion, a 217% increase from the same period last year when it reported data center revenue of $3.62 billion.\nThese gains have painted Nvidia\u2019s stock chart into a Matterhorn, with shares of the company up more than 500% since the start of 2023. All of a sudden, Nvidia is the third-most-valuable company in the world by market capitalization, ahead of giants like Saudi Aramco, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta.\nThe biggest moment of the show came early, as the CEO took the wraps off of Nvidia\u2019s new chips. Nvidia\u2019s GB200 Superchip and its \u201cBlackwell\u201d architecture will offer up to a 30x performance increase compared to the Nvidia H100 GPU for large language model inference workloads while using up to 25x less energy, which would make AI more efficient and cheaper.\nHuang also showed off the company\u2019s DGX SuperPOD supercomputer setup, which uses piped liquid coolant instead of traditional fan-based cooling. It\u2019s a reminder that the company isn\u2019t just a chip company, or even a software one, but also a larger engineering organization innovating at multiple levels.\nThe CEO spent a good deal of his keynote hitting on some of the finer points of the math and science behind how Nvidia\u2019s GPUs operate. And besides the engineers and scientists in the crowd, the information seemed to go over many attendees\u2019 heads.\nIt makes sense that Huang would hit on those topics, though. GTC is a developer conference, after all \u2014 not a consumer one \u2014 and you will not be going out and ordering a bag of Nvidia chips. But developers need to know the nitty gritty of what the company\u2019s chips can do.\nStill, it was interesting to see who in the audience was nerding out to the numbers and calculations and who was there for the broader strokes of Nvidia\u2019s product roadmap.\nAfter showing off a litany of AI software designed for everything from Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse platform to self-driving cars, Huang debuted the company\u2019s GR00T foundation model for humanoid robots. The system is meant to serve as the brains behind these human-like robots, helping them understand human language and mimic human movements.\nIt\u2019s not clear when or if GR00T, which stands for Generalist Robot 00 Technology, will take off as a go-to AI system for robots. After all, we\u2019re still in the early stages of humanoid robot development. But Huang is clearly making the case that Nvidia should be the company to help power the segment going forward.\nAll of this comes as Nvidia keeps its eyes on a growing field of competitors. Longtime rival AMD is also building out AI enterprise chips and technologies, and Intel is working to steal away its own piece of Nvidia\u2019s pie.\nAt the same time, Nvidia\u2019s customers are also working on their own AI graphics chips. Two of them, Amazon and Google, have already deployed their own cards in their respective data centers. And two more, Microsoft and Meta, are developing their chips for future use.\nFor now, though, the company continues to hold on to its position as the industry leader in AI hardware and software. And Huang seems dead set on staying there.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "Author": "  Jeff Santoro, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's little doubt that the hottest topic on Wall Street right now is artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, as of mid-February, more than a third of the S&P 500 companies that had reported earnings mentioned AI on their conference calls. This is a clear signal that companies are doing everything they can to highlight their AI credentials, whether they're truly meaningful or not.\nThe undisputed poster child for the AI boom has been Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Over the past 12 months, the company's stock has rocketed up 298% as its revenue has tripled. This explosive growth over such a short timeframe likely has investors wondering if they've missed the boat. Let's dig in and see if it's too late to buy Nvidia stock now.\nIt wasn't that long ago that Nvidia appeared to be struggling and the market sentiment was sour. In three consecutive quarters at the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023, Nvidia posted negative year-over-year revenue growth and its stock was down 66% from its late-2021 high.\nFor those who follow Nvidia, this lull was not unexpected. The semiconductor industry is cyclical, and Nvidia's second-largest segment at the time, gaming, was experiencing weakness. Pandemic lockdowns in China and slow computer sales resulted in a Q3 2023 (the quarter ending in October 2022) year-over-year revenue decline of 51%.\nIn that same quarter, Nvidia's largest segment, data centers, was up 31%. This increase was aided by cloud service providers and other industries, but in a sign of the times, there was no mention of AI. That boom was yet to come.\nIn May 2023, Nvidia reported its results for the quarter ending in April (its Q1 of fiscal 2024). While overall revenue increased by 19%, the guidance for Q2 kicked off the AI revolution. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted generative AI as one of the two transitions the computer industry was going through, and Nvidia's Q2 outlook was the data to back it up.\nAfter posting revenue of $7.2 billion in Q1, Nvidia forecast Q2 revenue of $11 billion, driven by data center demand for chips used for AI. This guidance represented a year-over-year revenue increase of 100%, and we were off to the races. The next three quarters did not disappoint.\n\u00a0\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ4 2024\nRevenue\n$13.5 billion\n$18.1 billion\n$22.1 billion\nYear-over-year growth\n101%\n206%\n265%\nData source: Nvidia\nAt first glance, it would make perfect sense to think the stock's recent run-up has pushed its valuation beyond the point of considering, and that could be the case for some. However, it's worth looking a little deeper into the numbers.\nCurrently, Nvidia trades for 78 times trailing earnings (P/E), which is very expensive. However, its growth rate is expected to continue, so on a forward basis, it only trades for 38 times earnings. That's still expensive, but when you compare it to its closest AI competitor, Microsoft, it looks more reasonable.\nThis is still an expensive multiple for either company, but there's good reason to believe Nvidia's growth will outpace Microsoft's, so one could make the argument that Nvidia is the smarter choice. That said, it's important to remember that forward earnings multiples are based on expectations and nobody knows for sure what will happen.\nNvidia could continue to reward shareholders, but patient investors may also benefit from waiting until the red-hot AI rush starts to cool. This is, after all, a cyclical industry, and the cycle should eventually turn around, providing better buying opportunities.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Nvidia (NVDA) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 50%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 84% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -1.6%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 0.6%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.1% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nvidia a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Nvidia is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) won over Wall Street last year, illustrated by its more than 280% stock growth since March 2023.\u00a0The company's years of dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs) perfectly positioned it to profit significantly from a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) as demand for the chips skyrocketed. As a result, Nvidia's quarterly revenue and free cash flow are up 207% and 430%, respectively, in the last 12 months.\nThe company's meteoric rise has some analysts questioning whether the company has much more to offer investors in 2024. However, trends in the chip market indicate Nvidia will have little problem retaining its leading market share in AI GPUs, despite new offerings from Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.\nMeanwhile, the AI market is nowhere near hitting its ceiling. It's projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. The sector's potential indicates GPU demand is likely to continue rising for the foreseeable future, with Nvidia well-equipped to continue enjoying significant gains from AI.\nHere's why Nvidia remains an attractive buy in March.\nNvidia's success in the AI chip market has led to countless tech companies announcing ventures into the industry. Leading chipmakers AMD and Intel plan to begin shipping new GPUs soon in an attempt to challenge Nvidia's market share. Meanwhile, companies new to the sector are also joining in, as Amazon and Microsoft announced new AI chips last year.\nHowever, market trends suggest Nvidia's supremacy will be challenging for competitors to overcome. The company has held an over 80% market share in desktop GPUs for years, despite AMD's and Intel's presence in the sector.\nIntel only entered the industry last year, while AMD's history in desktop GPUs spans decades. Still, AMD's GPUs only account for about 10% of the market.\nA similar situation has occurred in another area of the chip market. Intel was a king in central processing units (CPUs) for years, with an 82% market share at the start of 2017 when AMD landed on the scene with its Ryzen line of CPUs. AMD has managed to steal a significant share from Intel since then. However, Intel is still responsible for most of the CPU market; its share is above 60% and AMD's is at 36%.\nNvidia's estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI GPUs could falter slightly as competition heats up. However, history indicates the company will retain its overall lead and continue to see major gains from AI for years.\nNvidia has stunned Wall Street over the last year, posting multiple quarters of record earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2024 (ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The monster growth was primarily from a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting increased chip sales.\nWhile a spike in AI GPU sales is mainly responsible for Nvidia's stellar financial growth, the chipmaker is also profiting from an improving PC market. Spikes in inflation prompted steep declines in PC sales, with shipments dipping 16% in 2022 and continuing to fall for most of 2023. However, recent reports indicate the market is finally showing signs of recovery.\nAccording to Gartner, PC shipments popped 0.3% in Q4 2023, marking the first such increase in over a year. Market improvements have been reflected in Nvidia's sales, with its PC-centered gaming segment reporting an 81% rise in revenue in Q3 2024 (which ended October 2023).\nA leading role in AI and a recovering PC market suggests Nvidia has a strong outlook in the coming years. Earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates seem to support this.\nThe above chart shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $34 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 38 yields a stock price of $1,292.\nConsidering the company's current position, that projection would see Nvidia's stock rise 40% over the next two years. The company may not replicate last year's growth but would still beat the S&P 500's 22% growth since 2022.\nAs a result, Nvidia still has much to offer new investors and is an exciting buy right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Billionaire David Tepper Is Selling Alphabet and Nvidia Hand Over Fist, but Is Buying These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Billionaire David Tepper likes artificial intelligence (AI) stocks -- the bigger, the better. Pick a megacap AI stock, and there's a pretty good chance that it's in the portfolio of his hedge fund, Appaloosa Management.\nTepper isn't as big of a fan of some of these stocks as he is of others, though. The successful hedge fund manager has been selling shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) hand over fist, but he has been buying two other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Tepper slashed Appaloosa's stake in Nvidia by nearly 23%. While the GPU maker still ranks as the hedge fund's fourth-largest holding, Tepper clearly isn't as bullish about it as he once was.\nWhy would the billionaire sell such a big chunk of his position in Nvidia? The most likely answer is its valuation. Nvidia's share price skyrocketed by nearly 240% last year. Tepper could have been concerned, as quite a few other investors were, that the stock's valuation was becoming frothy.\nAppaloosa also reduced its stake in Alphabet by more than 16%. Again, Tepper hasn't thrown in the towel on the tech giant. Alphabet remains the seventh-largest position in his hedge fund.\nValuation probably wasn't the overriding factor behind the decision to sell some of the stake in Alphabet. It's possible, though, that Tepper might have been concerned that Alphabet's revenue from Google Search could be threatened by the development of AI-powered virtual assistants.\nSo which Magnificent Seven stocks is Tepper more enthusiastic about? He added to Appaloosa's stakes in two of them.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) already ranked as Appaloosa's third-biggest holding. In Q4, the hedge fund added another 200,000 shares, increasing its stake by more than 5%.\nIt's not hard to think of reasons why Tepper might have decided to invest more heavily in the e-commerce and cloud services leader. Its profitability has been improving significantly, and Tepper could expect this trend to continue in 2024.\nHe also remains a fan of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The technology giant held the No. 2 spot in Appaloosa's portfolio going into Q4. During the quarter, Tepper bought an additional 65,000 shares of Microsoft -- enough to boost the hedge fund's stake by nearly 4%.\nMicrosoft continues to fire on all cylinders. The company's integration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model throughout its product lineup appears to be paying off handsomely. Customers are flocking to Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and the AI tools that it offers. Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard also puts it in a stronger position in the gaming market.\nWere these buy-and-sell transactions of Magnificent Seven stocks smart moves on Tepper's part? So far, the verdict is mixed.\nBoth stocks that Appaloosa sold have risen since the end of Q4. Nvidia has soared by nearly 80%, while Alphabet is up close to 6%. Adding to his fund's stakes in Amazon and Microsoft, though, has paid off: Each has jumped by a double-digit percentage thus far in 2024.\nI wouldn't be surprised if the valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft eventually catch up with them. However, any sell-off of those stocks would likely only be temporary.\nMy view is that Tepper -- and other investors -- would be wise to scoop up more shares of all four of these Magnificent Seven stocks on pullbacks.

        "Text": "Nvidia\u00a0is the pioneer in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips as its graphics processing units have been playing a central role in helping cloud service providers train large language models. This explains just why the semiconductor giant's revenue, earnings, and stock price have simply taken off in the past year.\nThe good part is that Nvidia's estimated market share of more than 90% in AI chips indicates that it could very well sustain its eye-popping growth in the future. After all, the market for AI chips is expected to exceed $304 billion in annual revenue by 2030 as per third-party estimates, and there are a few Wall Street analysts who believe Nvidia could end up sitting on the lion's share of this opportunity in the long run.\nHowever, Nvidia's rapid growth means that it is now trading at a rich valuation. At 75 times trailing earnings and 36 times sales, Nvidia is not a value play. Of course, the company's forward multiples indicate that it could justify its rich valuation by delivering outstanding growth in the future, but not everyone may be comfortable paying the rich multiples to buy this AI stock.\nQualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), however, is an incredibly cheap semiconductor stock one can buy right now to capitalize on the proliferation of AI. Its growth may not be anywhere close to Nvidia's currently, but it seems on track to benefit from two fast-growing AI-related markets that could supercharge its growth in the long run.\nQualcomm is the second-largest manufacturer of smartphone application processors in the world. According to Counterpoint Research, the company controlled 23% of this market at the end of 2023. It is worth noting that Qualcomm's growth has been nothing to write home about over the past year or so thanks to the slowdown in the smartphone market.\nHowever, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended Dec. 24, 2023), Qualcomm's handset revenue increased 16% year over year to $6.69 billion. The company's overall revenue, meanwhile, was up 5% year over year to $9.92 billion. So, Qualcomm gets just over two-thirds of its total revenue from selling smartphone chips.\nThe good news for Qualcomm is that the smartphone market is set to recover from 2024. Market research firm IDC is predicting a 2.8% increase in smartphone sales this year to 1.2 billion units. Sales of AI smartphones, however, are expected to more than triple this year to 170 million units from 51 million units last year, accounting for 15% of the overall market in 2024.\nAccording to another estimate from Counterpoint Research, AI smartphone shipments could increase at an annual pace of 83% through 2027, with annual shipments set to exceed 500 million units at the end of the forecast period. Also, AI smartphones are predicted to account for 40% of the overall smartphone market in 2027, indicating that their sales could keep heading higher.\nCounterpoint estimates that Qualcomm could capture more than 80% of the market for generative AI-powered smartphones over the next couple of years. This could help the company sustain the newly found momentum of its handset business. Qualcomm is looking to capitalize on this lucrative opportunity with its latest product development moves.\nIts Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile processor platform can run generative AI models locally on smartphones, including voice-enabled AI assistants and the Stable Diffusion image generation model. And now, the company is looking to push the envelope further with the new Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 smartphone processor that it claims will help run generative AI models locally on mid-range smartphones.\nQualcomm claims that this new chip can run over 30 AI models on smartphones, including Llama 2 and Google Gemini. The company's flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is already in use by Samsung to power AI features in the latest Galaxy S24 models, and this new addition is expected to help Qualcomm tap mid-range Android OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) such as Xiaomi and Honor.\nQualcomm, therefore, is pulling the right strings to ensure that it remains in a solid position to tap the AI-powered smartphone market. On the other hand, Qualcomm has also set its sights on the AI personal computer (PC) market as well. PCs powered by Qualcomm's AI-focused Snapdragon X Elite system-on-a-chip (SoC) are set for launch in mid-2024.\nQualcomm's management remarked on the company's January earnings conference call that Snapdragon X Elite's \"design win traction continues to increase since the platform was announced last October.\" Samsung is reportedly going to deploy this SoC in a new notebook and rumors suggest that it could be more powerful than rival offerings from Intel, AMD, and Apple.\nManagement also expects \"Snapdragon X Elite to set the industry benchmark for on-device gen AI and copilot experiences in addition to leading performance and battery life for next-generation Windows PCs.\" If Qualcomm can translate these claims into real-life performance, it won't be surprising to see the company making a dent in the AI PC market.\nWith the market for AI PCs forecast to increase at an annual pace of 50% through 2030, Qualcomm's entry into this market could unlock a solid growth opportunity for the company. So, the company could capitalize on AI adoption in two lucrative markets, which is why it may be a good idea to buy it while it is still cheap.\nQualcomm is currently trading at 24 times trailing earnings and 18 times forward earnings. Both these multiples represent a discount to the Nasdaq-100 index's trailing earnings of 31 and forward earnings of 28 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks).\nHowever, Qualcomm may not be available at such cheap multiples once AI starts moving the needle in a bigger way for the company. We have already seen that its handset business is picking up and the prospects of the AI smartphone market suggest that it could keep getting better. AI PCs, on the other hand, will help Qualcomm move into a new niche, thereby allowing the company to start growing at a faster pace than the market's expectations.\nOnce that starts happening, Qualcomm stock could start soaring like other chipmakers that are flying on the back of growing AI-driven sales, which is why investors would do well to buy it while it is still cheap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Qualcomm right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Qualcomm wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) once was known as the company that powered gaming and graphics. The tech giant created graphics processing units (GPUs), or chips that process many tasks simultaneously. This, allowing for great speed, helped games spring to life on the screen.\nToday, Nvidia still leads in the gaming world -- but this no longer is the company's biggest business. Instead, it's moved on to another industry that's on fire at the moment and may continue to pick up momentum in the coming years. In fact, Nvidia's revenue from this particular market has climbed more than 1,000% in just four years. Let's find out more.\nBack in 2006, Nvidia launched CUDA, a programming model allowing GPUs to be used for just about any task. This expanded Nvidia's revenue potential and helped the company get into the business of artificial intelligence (AI) before this technology grabbed the world's attention. And this brings me to the business that's seen such enormous growth over the past few years.\nAs shown in the Statista chart, below, Nvidia's revenue from compute and networking, which includes AI systems and high-performance computing, has skyrocketed 1,345% over the past four years to more than $47 billion in the 2024 fiscal year. Graphics, which includes gaming, used to be the company's biggest revenue source back in 2020, but this no longer is the case -- even though graphics revenue has climbed since that time.\nIn short, Nvidia's entire revenue opportunity has expanded, led by AI products and services. You'll recognize this in the company's earnings reports as the data center business, and this unit reported record revenue in recent quarters. This has helped the company's total revenue to reach all-time high levels too.\nWhat does this mean for investors? Nvidia is the leader in the AI chip market, and this technology's growth is just getting started. So, investors interested in betting on AI winners may consider buying shares of this exciting tech player.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has witnessed a remarkable run, showcasing a staggering 82.5% surge in its stock price in the first quarter of 2024, pushing the company to the forefront of technology and innovation. NVIDIA also achieved a massive milestone in March 2024 by joining the exclusive club of companies with more than $2 trillion market capitalization.\nThe surge reflects investors' confidence in NVIDIA's strategic positioning, robust financial performance and pivotal role in shaping transformative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), gaming and data center solutions.\nHowever, the looming question remains \u2014 Can NVIDIA sustain this momentum in the quarters ahead?\nNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\nNVIDIA\u2019s robust stock price performance has been primarily driven by hopes that the company will be a prime beneficiary of growing investments in generative AI. Given generative AI\u2019s inherited opportunities and the company\u2019s leadership in the space, we believe the NVDA stock is poised to carry the momentum in 2024.\nNVIDIA dominates the market for AI chips. The meteoric rise of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and its adoption among enterprises have already proven generative AI technology\u2019s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.\nThe growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 39.6% from 2024 to 2030.\nHowever, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\nNVIDIA\u2019s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. The company\u2019s GPUs are already being applied in AI models. This is expanding NVDA\u2019s footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\nThe generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. Considering surging AI investments across the data center end market, NVDA expects its first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues to reach $24 billion from $7.19 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Growth Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities for investors.

        "Author": "  Natasha White ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Concerns that Nvidia Corp.\u2019s stratospheric gains might be unsustainable have spread to ESG investment managers who beat the market last year by betting big on the stock.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nStock Traders Bracing for Worst Shrug Off Hot CPI: Markets Wrap\nEx-Wall Street Banker Takes On AOC in New York Democratic Primary\nUnited Tells Boeing to Stop Making Its Long Delayed Max 10s\nChina Has Never Canceled This Many Shipments of US Wheat\nTrump Wins Republican Nomination, Setting Up Rematch With Biden\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic in the long run, but recognize that the valuation isn\u2019t exactly attractive,\u201d said Kristofer Barrett, who oversaw a decision to make Nvidia the biggest holding in Swedbank Robur Technology, transforming it into the top performer in a Bloomberg ranking of ESG funds last year. The Swedbank fund, which is registered as \u201cpromoting\u201d environmental, social and governance metrics under European Union rules, returned 53% in 2023.\nBut there\u2019s now some concern that Nvidia may end up a victim of its own success, according to Barrett.\nThere\u2019s a \u201crealization that this has become a retail stock,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that portends a bubble, potentially.\u201d\nOverall, the proportion of ESG funds holding Nvidia shares dropped to 15% of the total at the end of December from a high of 20% in the second quarter of 2023, according to fresh data provided by Morningstar Direct.\nThe figures, which cover equity-oriented open-end and exchange-traded funds that satisfy Morningstar\u2019s ESG criteria, show that the value of those funds\u2019 exposure to Nvidia was roughly $17.6 billion at the end of last year, down about 10% from the middle of 2023. In the same period, Nvidia\u2019s market value rose 17%.\nNvidia enthusiasts point to its iron grip on the chips needed to develop artificial intelligence, after Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang managed to turn a niche maker of graphics cards for gamers into a $2 trillion technology colossus. And so far, warnings of a sudden downturn in Nvidia shares have generally been followed by eye-popping gains.\nLast year, Nvidia\u2019s market value soared almost 240%, and is already up almost 80% in 2024. Of the 66 analysts tracking Nvidia, none is advising clients to sell, while 60 say investors should continue to buy the shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nESG funds betting big on Nvidia are delivering better returns than their peers. Among these is the Robecosam Net Zero 2050 Climate Equities fund, which is registered under the EU\u2019s strictest ESG disclosure rules. Chris Berkouwer, who manages the Robeco fund, says Nvidia is treated as a \u201ctransition facilitator\u201d in his portfolio, based on a view that its technology will help companies across industries cut their environmental footprints.\nThe $150 million fund is up about 7% in the past month, outperforming more than 90% of its peers, Bloomberg data show. Berkouwer said there are 30 stocks on which the Robeco fund is more overweight than it is on Nvidia, even though it\u2019s among the biggest holdings in absolute terms.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still quite optimistic on Nvidia,\u201d said Berkouwer. Nvidia\u2019s latest quarterly results, which the company used to deliver a sales forecast that once again surpassed analyst estimates, has \u201ckept the AI dream alive,\u201d he said.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\nNvidia is significantly increasing supply to meet surging demand, which is expected to exceed all-time highs this fiscal year across revenue, Ebitda, net income, cash from operations and free cash flow. Upgrades from both Moody\u2019s and S&P in 2023 highlight the company\u2019s sustainable competitive advantages in the accelerated computing category.\nClick here to read the full Feb. 24 report by BI\u2019s Robert Schiffman and Abigail Marshall.\nNvidia Ebitda Consensus F2025-2027:\n\u201cDespite the price going up significantly, the earnings have risen even more,\u201d said Berkouwer, who notes that Nvidia is part of a \u201cbalanced mix\u201d in his portfolio. \u201cThat is really impressive and a testament to Nvidia being able to successfully meet that demand.\u201d\nBut as Nvidia morphs into one of the world\u2019s absolute biggest companies, there\u2019s also a growing number of skeptics. Cathie Wood, despite being an outspoken proponent of the transformational potential of AI stocks early on in the cycle, actively trimmed her exposure to Nvidia last year and other big-name stocks tied to the AI boom.\nAnd hedge funds that piled into tech stocks before Nvidia\u2019s latest set of results are now exiting at the fastest pace in seven months, according to data from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s prime-brokerage unit.\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment.\nBarrett, who\u2019s leaving Swedbank for a role at another firm he can\u2019t name until an official announcement has been made, was replaced as portfolio manager of the Swedbank Robur Technology fund in February.\nChristian Blink, who now runs the Swedbank fund, said Nvidia \u201cmight be a little bit stretched\u201d in the short term, with the possibility of some investors seizing the moment to cash in.\nFurther out, the outlook is positive. \u201cWe believe that people tend to underestimate the long-term implications from generative AI and Nvidia is an enabler for that technology,\u201d Blink said.\nAnd Nvidia remains the fund\u2019s biggest holding, now accounting for almost 10% of the roughly $15 billion Swedbank portfolio, he said.\nA bubble is \u201calways a worry,\u201d Blink said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is one, but many factors are there for generative AI to become one. We are monitoring that.\u201d\n--With assistance from Nick Turner and Amy Thomson.\n(Adds benchmark comparison in 10th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them\nAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing Boom\nLuxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the US\nPrimaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the Polls\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "OK, I know what you're thinking.\nForget Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)? The company is the undisputed leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and the best-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock since early last year. Furthermore, Nvidia generated triple-digit year-over-year growth for three successive quarters and is forecasting another one for the current quarter. I've been bullish on Nvidia for a long time.\nYou're absolutely right on every one of those counts. And no, I haven't changed my mind. I'm still as bullish on Nvidia as ever. Here's the thing: The stock is selling for 80 times earnings and 39 times sales, and despite its growth trajectory, some investors won't even consider a stock with a valuation of that magnitude, even if the forward multiples of 38 times earnings and 18 times sales are more favorable.\nFor investors who have absolutely no intention of buying Nvidia at this level, I offer two alternatives from among the other six stocks in the Magnificent Seven: of Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Tesla.\nThese stocks still have significant upside but with more reasonable valuations. Furthermore, while Wall Street loves Nvidia, they love Amazon and Microsoft even more.\nIt's easy to see why Wall Street has a soft spot for Amazon. The company revolutionized digital retail, turning a humble online bookstore into an e-commerce juggernaut. Amazon controlled roughly 38% of the e-commerce market last year, according to online data provider Statista. For context, that's more than the next 14 digital retailers combined. The improving economy will no doubt boost its fortunes over the coming year and beyond.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the undisputed leader in the cloud infrastructure space it pioneered, with 31% of the market, according to market analyst Canalys. In response to the accelerating demand for generative AI, Amazon beefed up its cloud offerings, providing the company with a compelling opportunity for future growth.\nLet's not forget Amazon's digital advertising business. The company was already the third largest online advertiser, behind just Google and Meta Platforms -- and that was before Amazon added advertisements to its Prime Video that will surely boost its revenue.\nInvestors might be surprised to find that, of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Amazon is the hands-down favorite among Wall Street analysts, not Nvidia. Of the 47 analysts who cover Amazon, 91% rate the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommends selling. Only 55% rate Nvidia stock a buy, with the rest moving to hold or sell based on valuation concerns.\nWhen it comes to Amazon, Mizuho analyst James Lee is the most bullish among his Wall Street colleagues. He has a buy rating and $230 price target on the stock, which suggests roughly 30% upside. The analyst cites improving revenue for AWS and operating efficiency gains for Amazon's e-commerce business as fueling his positive take.\nGiven the multiple drivers for future growth, it's easy to see why Amazon is a favorite among Wall Street analysts. Furthermore, at less than 3 times next year's sales, Amazon stock is a bargain.\nIt's not difficult to see the appeal of Microsoft. It's best known for its ubiquitous Windows operating system and its leading suite of business productivity software, Office, which provides the company with a strong foundation upon which to build its future.\nMicrosoft Azure is the No. 2 Cloud provider, with 26% of the market, and growth recently accelerated to 30% year over year in the most recent quarter, outpacing AWS and Google Cloud at 13% and 26%, respectively. Helping fuel those market share gains was the company's quick move into generative AI and its suite of AI-fueled digital assistants dubbed Copilot.\nThese moves increased demand for Azure. In its fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended Dec. 31, the company noted that 6 percentage points of its cloud growth was the result of growing demand for AI services.\nMicrosoft is also more highly rated on Wall Street than Nvidia. Of the 34 analysts who offered opinions in March, 79% rate the stock a buy or strong buy, also well ahead of the GPU specialist.\nAnalysts at Truist are Microsoft's biggest cheerleaders on Wall Street. They have a buy rating and a Street-high price target of $600, which represents 42% upside for investors. The analysts cite Microsoft's early implementation of generative AI and see additional demand for Azure and Copilot as driving future growth.\nMicrosoft's early moves in AI and strong legacy businesses help illustrate why the stock is preferred on Wall Street. Furthermore, at less than 36 times forward earnings, Microsoft is selling at a slight premium to the multiple of 28 for the S&P 500. However, given its robust growth and future prospects, Microsoft is deserving of its premium -- and it's still cheaper than Nvidia.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "There's little question that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the standard bearer for the possibilities resulting from recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI). The company's cutting-edge processors are the gold standard for use with AI models, which has supercharged its stock and helped it surge more than 500% since the start of 2023.\nOne Wall Street analyst believes there's still much more stock price appreciation to come.\nAnalysts at Truist Financial raised their price target on Nvidia to $1,177 while maintaining a buy rating on the shares. That represents a potential gain of 33% over the next 12 months or so compared to the stock price when the market closed on Monday. The Truist analyst said investors are underestimating Nvidia's leading position in parallel computing and AI.\nThe analyst goes even further, calling Nvidia \"the AI company,\" citing its ongoing investment and its \"culture of innovation\" as strategic advantages.\nIt's hard to find fault with the analysts' position. When Nvidia reported the results of its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28), the company spent a record $2.46 billion on research and development (R&D), capping off a year in which the company spent $8.68 billion on R&D -- also a record.\nMuch has been made about the looming competition as rivals scramble to develop a better, faster, more robust AI processor. However, Nvidia has a long track record of staying ahead of the competition, and -- thanks to its ongoing heavy spending on R&D -- that's unlikely to change anytime soon.\nFurthermore, Nvidia is currently selling for 74 times trailing 12-month earnings. Wall Street expects Nvidia to generate earnings per share (EPS) of $24.46 in 2025 and $29.82 by 2026. If the analyst's price target is accurate, that would shrink the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 48 next year and 39 the year after, which suggests Nvidia stock is a bargain at its current price.\nFor those reasons and more, Nvidia stock is a buy.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sheryl Estrada ",
        "Text": "Good morning. CoreWeave is positioning itself for the generative AI boom as a top cloud provider, and the Nvidia-backed startup just added a finance chief whose experience among the sector's biggest players can help his new firm, well, compete against the sector's biggest players.\nCoreWeave, which provides cloud GPUs crucial for high-powered AI computing, announced on Tuesday that Nitin Agrawal is taking over as CFO. He previously was VP of finance for Google Cloud.\nWhy join the startup? \u201cCoreWeave is filling a void in the high-performance computing space left unaddressed by the legacy cloud providers,\u201d Agrawal told me. \u201cI think we have a unique opportunity to build the next generation of cloud infrastructure alongside the best team in the industry.\"\nAgrawal replaces Evan Meagher, who stepped down, according to the company. At Google, Agrawal said he and his team helped bring Google Cloud to profitability and developed its AI and machine-learning investment strategy. Before that, he served as CFO of Mapbox and held leadership roles at Amazon Web Services and Microsoft.\n\u201cAll of those roles have helped me learn the intricacies of operating a cloud business at scale and scaling new businesses in high-growth environments,\u201d Agrawal said.\nNew Jersey-based CoreWeave was cofounded in 2017 by current CEO Michael Intrator; Brannin McBee, the firm's chief development officer; and Brian Venturo, the chief strategy officer. It began as a crypto-mining company that used GPUs to verify blockchain transactions before pivoting to AI.\nThe startup announced in December it closed a $642 million round led by Fidelity Management & Research Co., with additional participation from Investment Management Corporation of Ontario, Jane Street, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Nat Friedman & Daniel Gross, Goanna Capital, Zoom Ventures and others. (That transaction values the company at $7 billion, but the firm declined to comment on that figure when asked by Fortune.)\nCoreWeave announced in August that it had secured $2.3 billion in debt financing led by Magnetar Capital and Blackstone, with participation from Coatue, DigitalBridge Credit, and funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, PIMCO, and Carlyle. The company also announced in April that it had raised $221 million in Series B funding led by Magnetar Capital, with contributions from Nvidia, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, and a month later secured $200 million in a Series B extension, also led by Magnetar Capital.\nCoreWeave uses Nvidia\u2019s graphics chips for data centers, and for building out data centers for AI computing, including a cloud-native AI supercomputer.\nBut what actually separates CoreWeave's AI infrastructure from that of competitors? It supports \u201cthe most demanding workloads, using purpose-built cloud infrastructure, to perform at the highest possible level for GPU-accelerated compute workloads, rather than using commoditized infrastructure,\" Agrawal explained. \u201cThat helps it to deliver both speed and reliability.\u201d\nAs CFO, Agrawal said he's focused on sustaining profitable growth, and \"the best way to accomplish it is by keeping customer priorities at the forefront\" and \"disciplined execution.\u201d\nGiven everything he's helped build, and everything he still plans to build, I asked Agrawal to share his favorite piece of career advice. He offered two.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it's the people that matter, so make sure you take people along with you in your journey,\" he said. And you should \u201calways keep a healthy disregard for the impossible while being grounded in reality.\u201d\nSheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com\nMar\u00eda Soledad Davila Calero curated the Leaderboard and Overheard sections of today\u2019s newsletter.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Intel Is at the Center of an Industrywide Push to End Nvidia's AI Dominance",
        "Author": "  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "A big reason why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is currently the overwhelming leader in the AI accelerator market is related to software. The company's CUDA software platform, which enables developers to write applications that tap into Nvidia's GPUs for accelerating workloads, has been widely used across academia and industry for nearly two decades. CUDA has become the de facto standard, and it only works with NVIDIA's products.\nWhen the AI boom kicked off in late 2022, Nvidia's GPUs and CUDA platform represented the path of least resistance. There are capable AI accelerators from competitors, including Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices, and cloud giants like Alphabet are increasingly designing their own custom AI chips. However, the CUDA software platform effectively locks customers into using Nvidia's GPUs.\nIntel has been working on oneAPI, an open specification that's at the heart of the company's efforts to kick-start an alternative to CUDA, for the past few years. oneAPI is multi-architecture, meaning that a single code base can be used across CPUs, GPUs, and other types of chips, and multi-vendor, meaning it aims to support chips from any company. This is in stark contrast to CUDA, which is locked to Nvidia's GPUs.\nIntel is far from the only company eager to see Nvidia's AI accelerator dominance erode. In late 2023, Intel came together with Arm Holdings, Alphabet's Google, Qualcomm, Samsung, and a few others to form the Unified Acceleration (UXL) Foundation. The core goal of this union is to build an open software ecosystem for all accelerators. Intel's oneAPI is at the center of this effort.\nFor companies like Google, which buys mountains of Nvidia's GPUs to power AI workloads for itself and its cloud customers, having alternatives to Nvidia could help cut down costs considerably. For companies like Qualcomm and Samsung, breaking CUDA's iron grip on the AI accelerator market makes it more likely that their own products will gain traction.\nSamsung has concrete plans to enter the AI accelerator market in early 2025 with the launch of its Mach 1 chips. While Samsung's first effort will be focused on AI inference, not AI training, the software ecosystem will ultimately determine whether the chip is a success.\nMeanwhile, Qualcomm is focused on integrating AI into all of its chips, an effort that will require software support to pay off. \"We're actually showing developers how you migrate out from an Nvidia platform,\" said Qualcomm's head of AI and machine learning in an interview with Reuters.\nIntel is going after the AI market in multiple ways. The company sells its Gaudi line of AI accelerators, and it's been baking AI chips into its recent CPUs.\nWhile the industrywide effort to break CUDA's dominance will make Intel's products more attractive, it's the company's semiconductor foundry business that may benefit the most. Intel plans to overtake foundry leader TSMC technologically in early 2025 with its Intel 18A process, and it has aspirations to become the world's second-largest foundry by 2030. The more competitive the AI accelerator market is, and the more chips that have AI capabilities built-in, the more potential customers for Intel's foundry.\nWhile a more competitive AI chip market may hinder Intel's market share in AI accelerators, the company's foundry opportunity is enormous. Global foundry spending topped $100 billion in 2022, and it's expected to more than double to $231 billion by 2032. In the long run, Intel's foundry could be raking in tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually.\nIt will take time for the anti-CUDA efforts to gain traction. UXL is aiming to get the specifications for its open alternative to a mature state by the end of the year, an eternity in the fast-moving world of AI. It will take even more time to get developers on board in numbers that are big enough to matter.\nBut the reward for this effort will be a more competitive AI chip market. For Intel, a hoard of AI accelerators gunning for Nvidia's dominance could help supercharge the company's foundry business in the years ahead.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Nvidia Corporation NVDA, Constellation Energy Corp. CEG, Meta Platforms META, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Eli Lilly and Co. LLY.\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nThe S&P 500 soared to new all-time highs on reassuring comments regarding potential interest rate declines. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has risen 8.3% so far this year.\nWe have highlighted five stocks that have gained in double digits so far this year. These are Nvidia Corporation, Constellation Energy Corp., Meta Platforms, Advanced Micro Devices and Eli Lilly and Co..\nThe Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a U.S. Senate committee that the central bank is \"not far\" from being confident that inflation is declining toward the 2% target, which would make rate cuts possible. The comment has bolstered investor expectations for the first rate cut in June.\nPowell noted that inflation had \"eased substantially\" since hitting a 40-year high in 2022 but that policymakers still needed \"greater confidence\" in its continued decline before cutting rates. He added that there are risks of keeping monetary policy tight for too long and damaging an ongoing economic expansion that has sustained a below 4% unemployment rate for two years.\nThe latest bouts of weak data have also raised the bets that the Fed might lower interest rates as soon as June. The U.S. manufacturing sector recorded its 16th consecutive month of decline in February, while Michigan University's consumer confidence index dropped slightly last month. U.S. personal spending data also showed the weakest reading in three years. Traders now see a 72.7% chance of the first rate cut this year in June, per CME Group's FedWatch tool (read: Is US Manufacturing Space Improving? 4 Sector ETFs Look Decent).\nFurther, the European Central Bank might also start cutting rates as soon as June on a softer outlook for inflation and economic growth.\nLet's take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7% of the assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, financials, healthcare and consumer discretionary accounting for a double-digit allocation each.\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust has an AUM of $497.7 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. It trades in an average daily volume of 65 million shares and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium-risk outlook (see: all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here).\nBelow, we have highlighted the above-mentioned five best-performing stocks in the ETF.\nNvidia is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing unit or GPU. The stock has jumped 87% so far this year. It has an estimated growth of 79.2% for the fiscal year ending January 2025.\nNvidia makes up 5.1% of the assets in SPY and has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. It has a Growth Score of A. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nConstellation Energy generates and markets electricity. It sells natural gas, renewable energy and other energy-related products and services. The stock has jumped 53.6% so far this year. It makes up 0.13% of the assets in the SPY portfolio.\nConstellation Energy has an expected earnings growth rate of 42.7% for this year and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It has a Momentum Score of A (read: Nasdaq ETF Logs Best Month Since 2015: 5 Top Stocks).\nMeta Platforms is the world's largest social media platform. The company's portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like the photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app due to acquisitions. The stock has jumped 44.7% and has an estimated earnings growth of 34.1% for this year.\nMeta Platforms accounts for 2.6% of SPY's assets. It currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.\nAdvanced Micro Devices has strengthened its position in the semiconductor market.

        "Title": "Nvidia pushes hard into robotics and automotive to convince Wall Street it can keep the growth humming",
        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "Nvidia\u2019s GTC shindig, which kicked off yesterday, is a developer conference. But this year's edition is more than that\u2014it\u2019s also a way for Jensen Huang\u2019s company to reassure investors that Nvidia\u2019s explosive growth is sustainable.\nAnd so, yesterday we didn\u2019t just see Huang showing off Nvidia\u2019s new Blackwell GPU, which is designed for \u201ctrillion-parameter scale\u201d generative AI and is supposedly five times as fast as today\u2019s H100 chips at performing genAI and twice as powerful at training. We also saw Nvidia significantly intensify its push into the robotics and automotive fields.\n\u201cEverything that moves in the future will be robotic,\u201d\u00a0the always leather-jacketed Huang enthused at the event, with robots flanking him on stage. Nvidia has been in the robotics game for a while\u2014its Isaac platform for sticking AI into industrial robots has been available for more than five years. But now it\u2019s launched a general-purpose foundation model called Gr00t, short for Generalist Robot 00 Technology, which is intended to power humanoid robots.\nProject Gr00t involves upgrades to Isaac that help robots understand spoken commands and watch humans to learn how we move. Also, a bunch of new Isaac tools help robotics companies train their products and boost their dexterity and vision. Then there\u2019s a new system-on-a-chip at the platform\u2019s core, called Jetson Thor, which borrows its name from a mash-up of Hollywood IP (Huang also brought a couple of Star Wars droids on stage, which he said had been trained with Isaac).\nAn impressive array of robotics firms is lined up as Gr00t customers, including Boston Dynamics, Sanctuary AI, Xpeng Robotics, and Unitree Robotics. There's no Tesla though\u2014it looks like Nvidia and Elon Musk\u2019s firm just became rivals on the robotic AI front.\nInterestingly, Nvidia also yesterday became an inaugural platinum member of the new Open Source Robotics Alliance, alongside Qualcomm and Alphabet\u2019s Intrinsic robotics unit. The alliance aims to support the development and governance of robot operating system projects.\nMeanwhile, a bunch of Chinese automakers have also signed up to build the new Thor version of Nvidia\u2019s Drive platform\u2014using Blackwell architecture\u2014into their vehicles. The biggest win there is BYD, the world\u2019s leading EV company in number of cars sold. BYD will deploy Drive Thor in its cars, while also using Nvidia\u2019s AI infrastructure for its production and retail operations.\nGAC Aion\u2019s luxury Hyper car brand is also adopting Drive Thor, as is Xpeng (again), Geely\u2019s premium Zeekr brand, and Li Auto. Expect to see the results on roads next year. But as for Gr00t, it remains to be seen how far in the future Huang\u2019s robots-everywhere vision actually lies.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Nvidia has now started migrating its AI foundation models\u2014previously available for free, as a way of getting developers to use its hardware\u2014into its paid-for API catalog. That\u2019s getting into the territory of competition with other models-as-a-service providers like Microsoft and Google, which are of course Nvidia\u2019s own customers.\nSo are the markets impressed? Not really\u2014Nvidia\u2019s share price actually dropped 1.5% this morning, showing that investors had already priced Blackwell in and that Nvidia still needs to show how all this imminent expansion affects its bottom line.

        "Title": "Nvidia (NVDA) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nNvidia (NVDA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 50%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 79.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -3.5%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 7.1%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 16.4% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Anna Tong and Stephen Nellis ",
        "Text": "By Anna Tong and Stephen Nellis\nSAN JOSE (Reuters) - Nvidia on Monday unveiled software aimed at making it easier for businesses to incorporate artificial intelligence systems into their work, broadening the chipmaker's offerings.\nThe release highlights Nvidia's push to expand its presence in the AI application execution sector, called inference, where the company's chips don't dominate the market, said Joel Hellermark, CEO of Sana, a maker of AI assistants for companies.\nNvidia is best known for providing the chips used to train so-called foundation models like OpenAI's GPT-4. Training involves ingesting large amounts of data and is done mostly by AI-focused and large tech companies.\nNow, companies of all sizes are scrambling to incorporate those foundation models into their work, which can be complicated. The Nvidia tools released on Monday are designed to make it easier to modify and run various AI models on Nvidia hardware.\n\"It's like buying a ready-made meal rather than going out and purchasing ingredients yourself,\" said Ben Metcalfe, a venture capitalist who founded Monochrome Capital.\n\"The Googles and Doordashes and Ubers, they can do all of this themselves, but now that Nvidia has more GPUs available they need to enable more companies to get value out of GPUs,\" he said. Those less tech-savvy companies can use the \"prepared recipes\" to get their systems up, he said.\nFor example, ServiceNow, a firm that provides software for use by technical support staff inside big businesses, said it used Nvidia's tools to create a \"copilot\" to help solve corporate IT problems.\nNvidia has some big-name partners for the new tools: Microsoft, Alphabet Inc's Google and Amazon will offer them as part of their cloud computing services, and Google, Cohere, Meta and Mistral are among companies offering models. But OpenAI, its financial backer Microsoft and Anthropic, two of the largest providers of foundation models, are notably missing from the list.\nNvidia's tools offer a potential revenue boost for the chipmaker: They are part of its existing software suite that costs $4,500 a year for each Nvidia chip if used on in a private data center or $1 per hour in a cloud data center.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Jose and Anna Tong in San Francisco; editing by Peter Henderson and Leslie Adler)\n"

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's no denying that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the poster child for artificial intelligence (AI). Its chips have become the industry standard for creating and running AI models, which has kicked its stock into overdrive, soaring roughly 500% since the start of 2023.\nOne Wall Street analyst believes this is just the beginning.\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse boosted his price target to $1,200 while maintaining a buy rating on Nvidia stock. This represents gains of almost 40% compared to the stock's closing price on Monday. The analyst believes investors are underestimating the company's software business, which has already achieved a $1 billion run rate annually and is \"only in the first inning.\"\nThe analyst further suggests generative AI will largely run in data centers, which could be a \"$500 billion business for Nvidia,\" pushing earnings per share (EPS) to $35 next year.\nThe analyst could be on to something. Just last month, CEO Jensen Huang laid out the opportunity:\nThere's about a trillion dollars' worth of installed base of data centers. Over the course of the next four or five years, we'll have $2 trillion worth of data centers that will be powering [AI] software around the world.\nThis is contingent on the continued adoption of generative AI, but most market commentators believe it's still early days. Data centers will need to increase their capabilities in order to keep up with the greater computational demands required by AI. Nvidia dominates the data center market with an estimated 95% share. Furthermore, Nvidia is the gold standard for machine learning -- an established branch of AI -- with a 95% share of that market.\nAll the pieces are in place for Nvidia to maintain its dominance. Furthermore, if Nvidia earns $35 per share next year, a stock price of $1,200 works out to a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 34, so the stock would be a steal at its current price.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The stock is up nearly 500% over the last year and 70% in 2024 alone. Investors have warmed to the theme of investing in data center infrastructure on the back of burgeoning demand from artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\nThis week's move follows the news that Vertiv has become a \"Solution Advisor: Consultant partner\" in Nvidia's partner network.\nWhen asked about power delivery to its newest AI GPUs at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) this week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Nvidia and Vertiv engineers were \"working on cooling systems\" and that \"Vertiv is very important in the supply chain of designing liquid cooled and otherwise data centers.\"\nThe company is an important part of the growth of AI and data centers, as seen in its order book. Vertiv's organic orders rose 23% year over year in its recently reported fourth quarter, leading to a record backlog of $5.5 billion. Considering that figure, management expects 2024 sales to range from $7.515 billion to $7.655 billion -- with the midpoint representing a 10% organic increase.\nManagement expects its sales increase to leverage into operating profit growth of 23% in 2024. It's a hugely impressive set of numbers from a company that entered 2023 with some question marks following a disappointing 2022.\nWhile Vertiv's valuation may start to look stretched at 36 times estimated 2024 earnings, the AI investing boom appears to have legs, and investors should keep an eye on Vertiv's order book through the year for confirmation of ongoing growth.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vertiv right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Vertiv, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vertiv wasn\u2019t one of them.

It has also been one of the hottest stocks in 2024, gaining 91% during that time.\nWith NVIDIA trading at new all-time highs, why jump in now?\nNVIDIA trades with a forward P/E of 38.8. While that is not in the traditional value stock range, which is normally under 15, that is cheap for NVIDIA, which has often traded above 40x over the last 5 years.\nNVIDIA\u2019s trajectory changed a year ago, as the demand for AI surged. It has beat, and raised, its earnings guidance each of the last four quarters. In the fiscal fourth quarter 2024, NVIDIA saw record quarterly revenue up 265% year-over-year, to $22.1 billion.\nEarnings growth is equally as impressive. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to see earnings jump another 84% in fiscal 2025.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Partners Also Expected to See Strong Growth\nSkeptical about NVIDIA\u2019s rapid growth? Tracey takes a look at two of its data center partners to see what their sales and earnings trajectory looks like.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI)\nSuper Micro Computer is also in the AI trade. It\u2019s hard to believe, but the stock has been even hotter than NVIDIA\u2019s.\nShares of Super Micro Computer are up 259% year-to-date and 823% over the last year.\nBut its sales and earnings consensus estimates are also tracking NVIDIA\u2019s. Super Micro Computer\u2019s sales in fiscal 2024 are expected to jump 103.5% year-over-year to $14.5 billion. The earnings are expected to rise 83.8%.\nSuper Micro Computer is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vertiv Holding Co. (VRT)\nVertiv is another partner company with NVIDIA on the data center side of the AI trade. Shares have jumped 69% year-to-date and over the last year are up 531%.\nVertiv is also seeing big growth from AI. It has been beating, and raising earnings guidance, for the last several quarters. Vertiv\u2019s earnings are now expected to jump 32.8% in 2024.\nSales are rising, but not as quickly asat \u00a0NVIDIA or Super Micro Computer. The Zacks sales consensus is looking for growth of 11.2% this year.\nVertiv is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.\nIs NVIDIA Too Hot to Handle? \nIt\u2019s difficult to buy a stock at, or near, a new all-time high. But NVIDIA\u2019s shares have made new highs many times over the last 5 years, as shares have surged 2000%.\nFundamentals matter as much as the chart. And NVIDIA has strong fundamentals right now, including sales and earnings growth.\nShould NVIDIA be on Your Short List? \nTune into this week\u2019s video podcast to find out.\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of VRT in her own personal portfolio and in Zacks Value Investor portfolio.]\n\u00a0\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) closed at $903.56 in the latest trading session, marking a +0.12% move from the prior day. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.11%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.12%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.12%.\nThe maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence's shares have seen an increase of 16.21% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.59% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.55%.\nThe upcoming earnings release of Nvidia will be of great interest to investors. In that report, analysts expect Nvidia to post earnings of $5.48 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 402.75%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $24.17 billion, showing a 236.08% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $23.84 per share and revenue of $105.13 billion, which would represent changes of +83.95% and +72.56%, respectively, from the prior year.\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 3.09% higher within the past month. Right now, Nvidia possesses a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\nWith respect to valuation, Nvidia is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 37.85. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 29.64.\nIt's also important to note that NVDA currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.22. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - General was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.55 at yesterday's closing price.\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 45, this industry ranks in the top 18% of all industries, numbering over 250.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - SK Hynix Inc said on Tuesday it has begun mass production of next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in artificial intelligence chipsets, with sources saying initial shipments will go to Nvidia this month.\nThe new type of chip - called the HBM3E - is a focal point of intense competition. Last month, Micron Technology said it had started mass production of the chips while Samsung Electronics said it had developed the industry's first 12-stack HBM3E chips.\nSK Hynix has, however, led the HBM chip market by virtue of being the sole supplier of the version currently used - the HBM3 - to Nvidia which has 80% of the market for AI chips.\n\"The company expects successful mass production of HBM3E and with our experience... as the industry's first provider of HBM3, we expect to cement our leadership in the AI memory space,\" SK Hynix said in a statement.\nThe new HBM3E chip by the world's second-largest memory chipmaker offers 10% improvement in heat dissipation and processes up to 1.18 terabytes of data per second.\nSK Hynix's HBM capacity is fully booked for 2024, analysts said, as explosive demand for AI chipsets drives up demand for high-end memory chips used in them.\n\"SK Hynix has secured an absolute market position... and its volume increase in high-end memory chips is also expected to be the most aggressive among chipmakers,\" said Kim Un-ho, analyst at IBK Investment & Securities.\nNvidia unveiled on Monday its latest flagship AI chip, the B200, said to be 30 times speedier at some tasks than its predecessor as it seeks to maintain its dominant position in the artificial-intelligence industry.\nShares in SK Hynix have doubled in value over the past 12 months on its leading position in HBM chips.\n(Reporting by Joyce Lee; Additional reporting by Heekyong Yang; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nNvidia (NVDA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 50%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 79.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -3.5%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 7.1%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 16.4% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) continues to be one of 2024's hottest stocks, having risen roughly 87% year to date as of this writing. Priced at roughly $926 per share, the artificial intelligence (AI) leader has a market capitalization of roughly $2.3 trillion and ranks as the world's third-largest company -- behind only Microsoft and Apple. Some on Wall Street believe that the red-hot AI stock is poised to continue marching higher.\nIn a research note published on March 22, UBS maintained a buy rating on Nvidia and raised its price target on the stock from $800 per share to $1,000 per share. Based on where the stock is priced as of this writing, that $1,000 target would imply additional upside of roughly 8%.\nLast week, Nvidia held its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) and gave attendees and virtual viewers the rundown on its next-generation Blackwell chips. The company says that it will launch its new processors later this year, and it looks like they will be roughly four times faster than its H100 GPUs that are the current, best-in-class processor being used to run OpenAI's ChatGPT service and its Sora video-generation software as well as applications from other leading AI providers.\nIn UBS's note, the firm said that it thinks Nvidia is poised to see another swell in demand. In particular, the analysts are excited about the AI leader's opportunity to begin selling processors, software, and services to government customers around the world. UBS anticipates that this catalyst will help Nvidia reach roughly $150 billion in sales in the 2025 calendar year and thinks that any pullbacks for the stock represent a worthwhile buying opportunity.\nI agree with the UBS analysts assessment that pullbacks on Nvidia stock should be approached as a buying opportunity. The company already commands a dominant position in the high-end GPU market, and the release of its B200 Blackwell processor later this year looks poised to make the company's competitive edge even stronger. Further adding to that advantage, Nvidia continues to roll out software suites that are strengthening its ecosystem, and there's a good chance it's still in the early stages of benefiting from the rise of AI.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  David Moadel ",
        "Text": "Not long ago, The Wall Street Journal reported that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) owned approximately 1.7 million shares of SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN). Surely, it\u2019s fair to call Nvidia a kingmaker in artificial intelligence. Therefore, investors should conduct their due diligence on SoundHound AI and then consider buying some SOUN stock.\nBefore you hit the \u201cbuy\u201d button, though, you\u2019ll need to understand why SoundHound AI isn\u2019t just another machine-learning-focused company. Once you get to know SoundHound AI and see how the company is growing, you\u2019ll almost certainly be ready to make a small investment.\nPlenty of companies specialize in artificial intelligence, but have you heard about conversational intelligence? That\u2019s SoundHound AI\u2019s focus. In particular, the company \u201coffers voice AI solutions that let businesses offer incredible conversational experiences to their customers.\u201d\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSoundHound AI co-founder and CEO Keyvan Mohajer provided further explanation to Yahoo! Finance. He stated that SoundHound AI is \u201cenabling cars and TVs\u2026 millions of devices, and we are powering customer service, we are in 10,000 locations with 100,000 in our pipeline\u2026\u201d\nNow, Nvidia\u2019s stake in SOUN stock makes a lot of sense. Just as Nvidia is the undisputed champion of AI graphics processing units, SoundHound AI is positioning itself as a leader in AI-powered customer-service products.\nSoundHound AI recently introduced a \u201cvoice assistant with integrated ChatGPT\u201d functionality for automobiles. Thus, SoundHound AI is a pioneer in what could prove to be a hyper-growth niche machine-learning market.\nSoundHound AI might be \u201cin 10,000 locations with 100,000\u201d more in the company\u2019s pipeline, but does this translate to revenue growth? The answer is definitely yes, and SoundHound AI has the data points to prove it.\nDuring 2023\u2019s fourth quarter, SoundHound AI generated revenue of $17.1 million, up 80% year over year. That\u2019s a result that even the most reluctant investors have to respect.\nSoundHound AI appears to be closing the profitability gap. Specifically, the company reported a Q4 2023 a net earnings loss of 7 cents per share, versus a net loss of 15 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter.\nLooking ahead, SoundHound AI expects to generate full-year 2024 revenue of $63 million to $77 million. Then, the company\u2019s outlook calls for 2025 revenue \u201cexceeding $100 million.\u201d This would represent rapid revenue acceleration, as SoundHound AI\u2019s revenue for 2023 was $45.9 million.\nThink about how successful Nvidia is in the area of AI GPUs. Could SoundHound AI become similarly successful in voice AI? It\u2019s a possibility worth considering.\nTo put it another way, SoundHound AI is a specialist in a niche AI market that could expand quickly in the coming quarters. Besides, SoundHound AI\u2019s revenue growth is indisputable.\nIt makes perfect sense, then, that Nvidia has a stake in SoundHound AI. Consequently, investors ought to research the company thoroughly and then pick up a few SOUN stock shares.\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content \u2013 and crossed the occasional line \u2013 on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are just a few of the powerful artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot applications available today. They can interpret and generate text, images, videos, and computer code, which could drive a productivity boom across the global economy.\nBut those AI applications wouldn't be possible without data centers filled with advanced semiconductors, which developers use to build, train, and deploy their models. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang estimates the current $1 trillion installed base of data center infrastructure around the world will double over the next five years because of AI.\nThat creates a substantial opportunity for leading chip companies Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU). Here's why investors might want to own a stake in each of them to ride the AI boom.\nThe gaming industry used to be Nvidia's largest source of revenue, but its graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center are now driving its business forward. In fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's H100 GPU sent the company's data center revenue surging 217% to $47.5 billion, and the current fiscal 2025 year is expected to bring more growth.\nNvidia's H100 is the most sought-after data center chip for AI workloads. Many tech giants are lining up to buy it in large volumes, from Amazon to Oracle to Meta Platforms. But Nvidia will ramp up shipments of its new H200 GPU this year, which could fuel the company's next wave of growth.\nThe H200 can inference -- which means to feed live data to an AI model so it can make predictions -- at twice the speed of its predecessor, and it also consumes 50% less energy, so it's a big cost saver for data center operators.\nLonger term, all eyes are on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, which will power its next-generation chips. The company is expected to ship its Blackwell B200 GPUs next year, which will deliver 15 times the inferencing speed of the H100.\nWall Street expects Nvidia's total revenue to soar 81% to a record $110 billion in the current fiscal year. Despite the 240% gain in its stock over the last 12 months, there is still plenty of room for upside.\nAMD makes some of the world's most popular chips for consumer electronics. They can be found in the Microsoft Xbox Series X and the Sony PlayStation 5, not to mention a long list of personal computers. But AMD recently launched its MI300 series of data center chips in a quest to chase down Nvidia.\nThe MI300 is available as a standard GPU called the MI300X, but it's also available in a combined GPU and CPU configuration called the MI300A. AMD is already shipping the MI300A to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for its El Capitan supercomputer, which will be one of the most powerful in the world when it comes online this year. But a number of leading data center operators, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms, are also lining up to buy the MI300 series.\nWhile AMD is chasing Nvidia in the data center, the company has a dominant market share of 90% in the emerging AI-enabled personal computing industry. Millions of computers from manufacturers like Dell and HP have already shipped with AMD's Ryzen AI chips, which allow users to process AI on-device. That leads to a faster, more responsive experience, because AI workloads don't have to travel to and from the data center.\nIn the recent fourth quarter of 2023, the Ryzen AI series sent the company's Client segment revenue up 62% year over year. Combined with the growing shipments of the MI300 chips -- which could generate $3.5 billion in sales in 2024 -- this could be AMD's biggest year.\nMicron doesn't get as much attention as Nvidia and AMD because it produces memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, which aren't as glamorous as GPUs. However, every GPU requires memory, and it's critical to extracting its maximum performance.\nMicron's latest HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) data center solution was selected by Nvidia to power its new H200. It's an obvious choice because it consumes 30% less power than competing HBM hardware, making it far more cost efficient. Micron is currently sampling a new HBM3E product, which packs 50% more memory into each GPU, allowing Nvidia's customers to bring their AI models to market far more quickly.\nMicron's entire 2024 HBM inventory is already sold out, and much of its 2025 stock is already spoken for, too.\nLike AMD, Micron's AI opportunity is expanding beyond the data center. The AI-enabled chipsets inside new personal computers can require 80% more DRAM content than traditional models, which is great for Micron's business. Many modern smartphones are also fitted with AI chips, which need twice as much DRAM as traditional devices. Samsung's new Galaxy S24 comes with a slew of AI features, and it runs on Micron's hardware.\nMicron's revenue jumped 57% year over year during the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Feb. 29). The company also delivered net income of $793 million, marking a welcome return to profitability after more than a year grappling with falling prices due to an oversupply of chips.\nMicron's forecast for the upcoming fiscal 2024 third quarter (ending June 1) points to accelerated revenue growth of 76%. Micron stock is trading at an all-time high, but it's still cheaper than both Nvidia and AMD, so this could be a great buying opportunity for investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.NVIDIA\u2019s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company\u2019s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.NVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company\u2019s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company\u2019s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.Santa Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024, up 126% from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023.Beginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments \u2013 Graphics and Compute & Networking.Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.Compute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.

        "Text": "How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.NVIDIA\u2019s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company\u2019s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.NVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company\u2019s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company\u2019s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.Santa Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024, up 126% from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023.Beginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments \u2013 Graphics and Compute & Networking.Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.Compute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.Graphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 22% and 78% of fiscal 2024 revenues, respectively.\nBottom Line\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk.

While Jensen Huang seems to have indicated that Nvidia will buy some HBM chips from Samsung as well, SK Hynix has gotten a big jumpstart by supplying previous generations of the technology.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that Samsung Electronics has become more attractive than in the past,\u201d said Yoon Joonwon, a fund manager at DS Asset Management Co. \u201cBut it\u2019s too early to buy it on expectations for its HBM business.\u201d\nRead More: Samsung Jumps Most in Six Months After Nvidia CEO\u2019s Backing\nThe AI theme has been more of a boon for SK Hynix so far, with its shares roughly doubling over the past year, outpacing Samsung\u2019s 30% gain. The difference lies in SK Hynix\u2019s lead in HBM chips, which work alongside processors crucial for the training of large language models. Samsung is more exposed to the cyclical demand and pricing of commoditized traditional memory, given its market share in consumer devices.\nThat\u2019s why it was a surprise when Huang reportedly said he plans to buy Samsung memory too. His comments helped boost shares of South Korea\u2019s most valuable company to a 9% weekly gain, their biggest in more than three years.\nOptions traders have been more ambivalent. Bets on both directions soared this week for Samsung, including puts wagering on a 70% drop in the next three months and calls that will cash in if the stock surges 300% in the same time span.\nDay traders took a contrarian stance on the Huang boost. While institutional investors poured cash into Samsung shares Wednesday and Thursday, retail traders sold 3 trillion won ($2.3 billion) worth of the stock on a net basis, a record two-day withdrawal.\n\u201cMajority opinion is still that Samsung won\u2019t be getting the call on HBM3E from Nvidia,\u201d said Cha So-yoon, a fund manager and equity team head at BNK Asset Management Co. \u201cIf there is a turnaround in tech sentiment, it will be great for both companies but SK Hynix doesn\u2019t appear to be losing its HBM hegemony.\u201d\n--With assistance from Jeanny Yu.\n(Updates as of Friday\u2019s closing prices)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley\nHong Kong\u2019s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland China\nIn This Coworking Space, Only the Cappuccino Isn\u2019t Classified\nTesla\u2019s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue\nJokes, Pop Music and Radical Honesty: How TikTok Is Changing Home Sales\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

The graphics chip giant announced the news during its annual GTC conference in San Jose on Monday.\nThe idea is to let developers use Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse tools in an AR/VR setting via the Vision Pro. Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse is a platform that allows programmers to create digital twins of objects and locations that they can use to determine how they\u2019ll behave or look in the real world.\nNvidia says organizations can use its Omniverse tool to create things like factories in a digital space so that they can understand how workers will move around the facility before they ever put shovels into the ground.\nDuring GTC, Nvidia showed how a designer could use a car configuration tool via the Vision Pro to manipulate different aspects of a vehicle and then virtually step into it.\nThe company says it\u2019s able to do this via its Omniverse Cloud APIs, or application programming interfaces, and its Graphics Delivery Network that streams directly to the Vision Pro via the cloud.\n\u201cApple Vision Pro is the first untethered device which allows for enterprise customers to realize their work without compromise,\u201d Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia vice president of simulation, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to our customers having access to these amazing tools.\u201d\nThe move is a win for both Nvidia and Apple. It ensures that Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse is available on Apple\u2019s high-end headset and gives Apple\u2019s Vision Pro another enterprise offering.\nApple's $3,499 Vision Pro is too pricy for most consumers, but enterprise customers, for the most part, can more easily swallow that kind of price. Plus, bringing Nvidia's Omniverse technology to the headset makes it a far more attractive purchase.\nWhether that means Apple will see a meaningful sales jump, however, remains to be seen.

        "Title": "3 Billionaires Are Selling Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia and Buying These 10 AI Stocks Instead",
        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "For three decades, investors have been privy to no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends. Although nothing has been as transformative as the advent of the internet, innovations and trends that have included genome decoding, businesses-to-business commerce, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and the metaverse have captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors alike.\nAt the moment, nothing is piquing the interest of investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. With machine learning, software and systems have the ability to evolve over time and become more proficient at their task(s). It's what gives AI such broad-scale appeal in virtually every sector and industry. It's also what's made semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) the hottest thing since sliced bread.\nAlthough Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been popular with the personal-computing gaming community for well over a decade, and its GPUs have gained traction with cryptocurrency miners during major crypto bull markets, it's high-compute data centers where the company's infrastructure has shone brightest.\nNvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are nothing short of dominant in AI-accelerated data centers. Analysts at Citigroup opined last year that Nvidia could control upwards of a 90% share of GPUs deployed by enterprises in high-compute data centers in 2024.\nWhat's really helped Nvidia is the scarcity of its top-notch GPUs. Since demand has swamped supply, it's been able to meaningfully increase the price of the GPUs it has available, which led to its sales more than doubling in fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended in late January).\nBut not everyone is on board with the Nvidia growth story. Based on the latest round of Form 13F filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission, eight billionaire investors reduced their respective funds' stakes in this Wall Street darling. In particular, three billionaire money managers cut their funds' stake by more than 1 million shares, including:\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management: 1,689,322 shares sold\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International: 1,170,611 shares sold\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management: 1,088,821 shares sold\nWhile some of this selling could be nothing more than benign profit-taking, Nvidia does have a growing list of headwinds to contend with this year. In addition to increasing external competition, the company is expected to contend with mounting internal AI-GPU competition from its top customers, the potential for margin cannibalization, and ongoing export restrictions to China.\nWhat's perhaps even more interesting is examining the collective 10 artificial intelligence stocks these three billionaires were buying as they were selling shares of Nvidia.\nNo billionaire money manager dumped more shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter than Millennium's Israel Englander. While he and his team were busy paring down their stake in Wall Street's top-performing megacap stock, they were mashing the buy button for a trio of \"Magnificent Seven\" components, including:\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 2,446,316 Class A shares (GOOGL) purchased\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL): 2,174,695 shares purchased\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): 85,532 shares purchased\nThe \"why?\" behind these buys is simple: They're respective industry leaders. Alphabet's Google has accounted for more than 90% of global monthly internet search share dating back nearly nine years. Meanwhile, Amazon's e-commerce marketplace is far-and-away the world's leading online retail site, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the highest share of cloud infrastructure service spend. Lastly, Apple's iPhone controls more than half of the domestic smartphone market share.\nBut these Magnificent Seven components are also counting on AI to fuel their future growth. Alphabet and Amazon are some of Nvidia's top customers that are currently developing their own AI chips. Both companies are incorporating generative AI solutions into their respective cloud infrastructure service platforms to help businesses build applications and tailor their message(s) to consumers.\nApple is also developing AI infrastructure of its own, with the company's processors capable of running generative AI on MacBook. For the moment, Apple's AI ties are primarily its integration of solutions, such as predictive text on the iPhone.\nIt's pretty clear that Israel Englander sees considerably more upside in Nvidia's peers within the Magnificent Seven.\nThe second-biggest billionaire seller of Nvidia stock during the fourth quarter was Susquehanna's Jeff Yass. While Yass and his investment aides slashed their funds' Nvidia stake by 27%, they were purchasing a trio of time-tested businesses with artificial intelligence ties that should be able to withstand a potential bursting of the AI bubble, including:\nAlibaba (NYSE: BABA): 5,297,854 shares purchased\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA): 527,008 shares purchased\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): 115,276 shares purchased\nAs noted, the key point about these AI stocks is that if the AI bubble were to burst, their core operations would, presumably, prevent them from getting caught up in any major downdraft. For example, Alibaba is China's No. 1 e-commerce platform, with Taobao and Tmall collectively accounting for a nearly 51% share of online retail sales. Alibaba Cloud is also No. 1 in market share in China (as of March 2023) and should continue to thrive given that enterprise cloud-service spending is still in its very early stages.\nTesla is North America's largest electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV maker that's been generating a recurring profit. Though it incorporates AI solutions into its self-driving technology, the company's success is ultimately determined by its ability to sell or lease EVs. If history were to repeat itself and the AI bubble were to burst, Tesla's operating results would ultimately dictate where its share price heads over the long run.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has its cash-cow legacy segments to fall back on, such as Windows and Office, as well as its high-growth initiatives, which include cloud infrastructure service platform Azure -- the worldwide No. 2 cloud infrastructure service provider by spend, behind only AWS. Although Microsoft is betting big on AI, arguably more so than Alibaba or Tesla, it would likely be just fine if AI expectations are tempered at some point in the not-too-distant future.\nThe final billionaire that was an aggressive seller of Nvidia stock during the December-ended quarter was Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management. While Cohen and his team were busy paring down Point72's stake in AI infrastructure kingpin Nvidia by 66%, they were buying four ancillary beneficiaries of the AI movement, including:\nOracle (NYSE: ORCL): 2,178,533 shares purchased\nWestern Digital (NASDAQ: WDC): 971,494 shares purchased\nDell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) 670,677 shares purchased\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG): 301,908 shares purchased\nSimilar to what Jeff Yass did at Susquehanna, Point72's investment team looks to be de-risking the fund by focusing on businesses that can benefit from AI but have less direct exposure if and when the bubble bursts. Whereas total sales for Oracle's recently reported quarter (ended Feb. 29, 2024) were up just 7%, infrastructure-as-a-service sales catapulted 49% from the prior-year period. While Oracle can easily lean on its legacy bread-and-butter segments if AI experiences a demand reset, it's well-positioned to be a long-term winner in AI infrastructure.\nWestern Digital is a potentially sneaky play on AI-driven storage. Just as Western Digital experienced a surge in demand during the initial wave of enterprise cloud-service spending, the growing storage demand needs in AI-accelerated data centers should be music to the ears of management. It could pave a path for the company's high-transfer-rate NAND flash memory solutions to become standard in data centers.\nTo keep with the theme, Dell Technologies has its core computing segments it can lean on if an AI bubble were to materialize. Nevertheless, it's witnessed exceptionally strong demand for customizable rack servers used by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers. Though this makes up a small percentage of Dell's business at the moment, it positions the company to sustainably benefit over the long run as AI solutions proliferate.\nCohen and his team also piled into robotic-assisted surgical systems developer Intuitive Surgical. This is a company that's utilizing AI to help surgeons study their own procedural data to improve patient outcomes. Ultimately, the company should enjoy sustained double-digit sales growth as the da Vinci surgical system gobbles up share in a variety of soft-tissue surgical indications. No company comes remotely close to the installed base of assisted-surgical systems that Intuitive Surgical has put in place since this century began.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "On March 18, Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced a major new collaboration, an artificial intelligence (AI) project that's already making waves in biopharma. In short, Nvidia is going to be building the pharma company a brand-new piece of hardware that could help it realize its ambitions of highly targeted and efficient drug discovery.\nBut many companies make claims about AI, and it's probable that many AI plays will be whiffs. So is Novo Nordisk stock still an appealing purchase, or is it going to strike out despite teaming up with the chip making giant?\nThe Novo Nordisk Foundation, a Danish group that owns a controlling stake in Novo Nordisk, is in the process of paying roughly $90 million to Nvidia so that the chipmaker can create a new supercomputing center in Denmark. Denmark's public Export and Investment Fund is contributing another $15 million, and the expectation is that the facility will be used by academic researchers as well as for commercial research and development (R&D) work. The plan is to perform pioneering biopharma R&D using AI, and perhaps eventually quantum computing.\nThe supercomputer called Gefion at the heart of the endeavor will be among the world's most capable. The partnership is an opportunity both for Nvidia to show off the power of its technology, and for Novo Nordisk to show off its forward thinking in the sphere of drug development. The favorable press generated by the announcement might bump up the already-high share prices of both businesses, too.\nOverall, this partnership should be slightly bullish for Novo Nordisk stock, but it's not as though the company just invented sliced bread. Applying copious amounts of computing power to drug development is nothing new, though it's possible that working the AI angle will be significant this time around and such efforts will yield actual functional medicines.\nSo take care to separate the hype about AI and supercomputing from the reality. At its very best, this new collaboration may lead to incremental improvements in metrics like drug efficacy, clinical-trial failure rates, and preclinical-candidate screening efficiency.\nThe supercomputing center should be in full swing by early 2025, with pilot projects starting sometime this year. Let's assume that between Nvidia's AI platform and the underlying hardware, Novo Nordisk is able to produce a superior-quality therapy candidate of some kind, moving far faster than average through preclinical work as well as clinical trials. If so, the company could have an exceptional new product hitting the market within the next five or six years. Depending on the indication the candidate targets, billions of dollars in revenue could result.\nBut that's a fairly unrealistic best-case scenario, and Novo Nordisk has a lot more happening to bolster the top line between now and then anyway. In particular, its medicines for type 2 diabetes and obesity -- Ozempic and Wegovy, respectively -- will be among the biggest cash cows ever to be invented by the pharma industry. Since mid-2021, when the FDA approved Wegovy for sale, the company's trailing-12-month (TTM) sales have risen by 69%, reaching $33.7 billion.\nAnd there's little to indicate that Wegovy's growth is going to slow down soon. On March 8, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it for use in reducing the risk of cardiovascular problems in obese or overweight people. That'll enable it to reach an even larger market than before. And Novo Nordisk is selling the drug so rapidly that it's making multibillion-dollar investments in manufacturing capacity just to try to prevent shortages due to popular demand.\nIn the near term, management doesn't expect that its efforts to expand supply can produce enough doses to completely meet demand. Plus, the company is working on a handful of potential successor drugs in late-stage clinical trials already, not to mention additional expansions of the approved indications.\nOf course, this setup looks great for the future of its share price. Novo Nordisk's stock is very much one that's worth buying, though the latest supercomputing and AI developments have little to do with what the company can do right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Novo Nordisk right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Novo Nordisk, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Novo Nordisk wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Better \"Magnificent Seven\" Buy: Nvidia vs. Apple Stock",
        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are a group of megacap technology companies that have thrived over the past few years and led this new bull market, but it's not been a smooth ride for every member of that group.\nTwo key members, iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and artificial intelligence (AI) chip company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), are moving in opposite directions so far in 2024. Apple's stock price has fallen 10% since January, while Nvidia's has risen over 80%.\nSo, which one of these two stocks is the better buy going forward?\n2024 hasn't been kind to the personal electronics giant. The iPhone maker has fallen more than 10% since January. Why? It's most likely due to declining growth expectations. Apple's revenue growth has slowed significantly, which analysts expect will trickle down to slower earnings growth.\nAdditionally, word out of China is that iPhone sales there are slipping. According to research by Counterpoint, iPhone sales were down 24% year over year in China through the first six weeks of the year, as consumers pass on iPhones for Chinese alternatives.\nNow, Apple is still a marvelous company. Investing legend Warren Buffett has called it the best business his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns. Apple makes up over 40% of Berkshire's $363 billion stock portfolio. However, it is understandable that Apple faces questions about its long-term growth. Growing isn't always easy for a massive $2.6 trillion company.\nOn the other hand, Nvidia has been growing shockingly fast. The company is benefiting from a surge of investments related to AI. Nvidia's AI chips are today's dominant market leader, with an estimated 80% market share. That's shown up in fascinating financial results that have seen Nvidia's revenue and profits go parabolic, launching the stock higher in the process.\nThe big question is whether this is a burst or a prolonged trend. Lisa Su, the CEO of Nvidia's competitor, Advanced Micro Devices, believes the AI chip market will grow to hundreds of billions of dollars over the next few years. Considering Nvidia's companywide revenue is still \"just\" $61 billion as the market leader, there's a lot of potential upside if this prediction comes true.\nInvestors might be understandably shy toward a stock that has risen so much so fast. However, the fundamentals have (so far) seemingly justified Nvidia's price action. That doesn't mean there aren't risks. For starters, Nvidia does tons of business with relatively few deep-pocketed customers. Losing any of them could put a big dent in revenue. It remains to be seen if AMD and other chip companies can encroach on Nvidia's market share over the coming years.\nChoosing between these two investments depends on whether you believe Apple is more likely to rebound or if Nvidia will run out of steam. Looking at fundamentals, Nvidia has a clear advantage. I like using the PEG ratio to gauge how much I pay for a stock's earnings growth. In other words, how much bang for your buck are you getting?\nComparing the two stocks below reveals a clear winner:\nCompany\nForward P/E Ratio\nExpected Long-Term Average Annual EPS Growth\nPEG Ratio\nApple\n26.0\n9.4%\n2.7\nNvidia\n35.6\n34.8%\n1.0\nData source: Ycharts. EPS = earnings per share.\nLower is better for the PEG ratio. I generally like buying stocks with a PEG ratio of 1.5 or less. As you can see above, Apple is far more expensive than Nvidia for the growth analysts expect over the long term.\nCould Nvidia fall short of analyst estimates? Could Apple outperform its expectations? Of course!\nBut the gap is so vast today that it's hard to justify picking Apple over Nvidia, especially when the company puts up the financials to justify the hype the stock is getting. That makes Nvidia the better Magnificent Seven stock to buy until proven otherwise.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Nvidia (NVDA) is a Great Choice",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at Nvidia (NVDA), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nSet to Beat the Market?\nIn order to see if NVDA is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence holds up.\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\nFor NVDA, shares are up 7.35% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry is up 1.5% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 16.21% compares favorably with the industry's 5.04% performance as well.\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Nvidia have increased 89.72% over the past quarter, and have gained 234.46% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.15% and 33.78%, respectively.\nInvestors should also pay attention to NVDA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. NVDA is currently averaging 61,106,484 shares for the last 20 days.\nEarnings Outlook\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with NVDA.\nOver the past two months, 15 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost NVDA's consensus estimate, increasing from $19.95 to $23.84 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 10 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\nBottom Line\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that NVDA is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Nvidia on your short list.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, prices are still up 60% year-to-date, CoinDesk data shows. Nvidia has pulled back 9% from its lifetime peak of $974 but still boasts a year-to-date gain of 77.5%.\nIn five years, bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization has jumped to $1.43 trillion from $70 billion. Similarly, Nvidia\u2019s market value has increased to over $2 trillion from around $100 billion.\nThe growing demand for Nvidia processors from ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) projects has been primarily responsible for the surge in the chip makers\u2019 valuations.\nThe 90-day correlation coefficient between the two has risen to 0.86, the highest since May 2023, having flipped positive in November, according to charting platform TradingView. The 52-week correlation has been consistently positive since July 2020 and has now risen to 0.88, the highest since January 2023.\nA coefficient of over 0.80 indicates that bitcoin and NVDA are highly correlated and tend to move in the same direction.\nThe statistical relationship is noteworthy, as some market observers, including investment management firm GMO, worry that the AI frenzy is similar to the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.\nThe launch of ChatGPT in December 2022 helped raise general awareness about artificial intelligence, and the subsequent love affair with AI stocks represents a \u201cbubble within a bubble,\u201d which could start to deflate,\u201d GMO\u2019s Chief Investment Strategist Jeremy Grantham explained in a paper published on Monday.

        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Software company Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and chip company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are two of the hottest stocks on Wall Street. Both stocks are up over 240% over the past year and have fierce loyalty among investors.\nIs one artificial intelligence (AI) stock better than the other? To find out, I compared them head-to-head to see why they're thriving and whether they can continue. It was a very close race, but one stood out just ahead of the other.\nHere is what you need to know.\nBoth stocks soared due to the fantastic performance of their underlying businesses. However, these two AI companies are very different. Nvidia spent years specializing in high-performance GPUs, which became ideal for data centers and AI. Nvidia's high-quality products and CUDA software, which helps customers efficiently use their GPUs power, have led to Nvidia grabbing an early stranglehold on the AI chip market -- an estimated 80% to 90%.\nOn the other hand, Palantir builds custom software applications for both government and commercial applications. It runs three software platforms: Gotham, Foundry, and AIP for AI applications. You can think of Palantir as an operating system that helps organizations use their data. The company's intent is that it augments human intelligence; it doesn't replace it.\nFrom a pure numbers standpoint, Nvidia is growing leaps and bounds faster than Palantir. You can see below how both companies began accelerating revenue growth in mid-2023, but Nvidia soared on massive data center spending from big technology customers, mainly in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" It could be fair to wonder how long this enormous boost in data center spending from big tech will continue.\nOne possibility is that these companies start producing custom chips in-house, weaning themselves off of Nvidia's. That could hurt long-term growth for a company currently getting most of its revenue from a small handful of customers.\nSpeaking of Palantir, the company is not as explosive as Nvidia. But what impresses me is the company's expanding customer base. Palantir's U.S. customer count grew 55% year over year in the fourth quarter and 22% quarter over quarter. Customers come in all shapes and sizes, so it's not a precise translation. Such customer growth bodes well for long-term revenue growth.\nMaybe Nvidia's customer concentration won't matter, and Nvidia's chips will maintain their market share. Still, I'd like to see customer expansion like Palantir's.\nAnalysts expect significant earnings growth from both companies moving forward. On a forward basis, that makes both stocks cheaper than you would guess after both of their 200% runs. I like using the PEG ratio to compare how much I pay for a company's earnings growth. The lower the PEG ratio, the better, and I would like to spend under 1.5 if I can.\nNvidia fits that criteria with a PEG ratio of just over 1. Palantir doesn't quite fit, with its PEG ratio of 1.6.\nNvidia is handily the better value today, based on each company's expected long-term earnings growth. Of course, the caveat is whether each company will perform up to expectations.\nBoth companies are excellent AI stocks and leaders in their respective areas. Both are accelerating their revenue growth. Naturally, analysts are very optimistic about each company's earnings growth moving forward. Whichever company you believe is more likely to meet growth expectations over the next three to five years is probably your winner.\nThis Fool is giving Palantir a slight edge. Why?\nPalantir gets roughly half its revenue from government contracts. The company's long history with the government could put a bit of a floor into Palantir's business, plus the upside from expanding its customer base. Meanwhile, Nvidia's customer concentration could be problematic if a significant customer opts for another chip.\nWhile the numbers say Nvidia is the better buy, there's an argument that investors can trust Palantir's long-term growth slightly more, especially when looking at the long term.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Bansari Mayur Kamdar\n(Reuters) - Investors have piled into Nvidia-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year on the frenzy around AI, with inflows into a bullish fund that tracks the shares of the chip designer hitting an all-time high on Wednesday.\nNet daily inflows into the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF hit a record of $197 million, according to LSEG Lipper data. The assets managed by the ETF have grown to $1.41 billion from $213.75 million at the start of the year.\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\nRisk-averse investors have largely stayed away from leveraged ETFs tracking single stocks that aim to provide returns over extremely short periods.\nThese ETFs, which made their U.S. debut in 2022, have become popular among speculators looking to bet on the most volatile shares based on earnings and other news.\nCONTEXT\nNvidia, which controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, has surged nearly 82% since the start of the year after a stellar forecast and amid renewed euphoria around AI.\nLeveraged single-stock ETFs seek to amplify the returns of an underlying stock for a single day, generally by two or three times, using financial derivatives and debt as leverage.\nKEY QUOTES\n\"Nvidia has been the hottest stock in 2024 and many investors are eager to seek out higher returns in exchange for added risk,\" said Todd Rosenbluth, chief ETF strategist at VettaFi.\n\"We expect to see continued demand for single stock leveraged ETFs as a new wave of must-own companies emerge.\"\nTHE NUMBERS\nNet monthly inflows into leveraged ETFs tracking Nvidia such as the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA ETF, the Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 1.5X Shares ETF and the T-Rex 2X Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF hit a record in February.\nThe GraniteShares ETF has already crossed its net monthly flow record within the first six days of the month.\nAssets of the three Nvidia-linked ETFs jumped between five and 11 times since the start of 2024, while their prices are up between 143% and 218% year-to-date, outperforming other ETFs.\n(Reporting by Bansari Mayur Kamdar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n"

        "Title": "NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is up by a considerable 75% over the past three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on NVIDIA's  ROE.\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n See our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:\n69% = US$30b \u00f7 US$43b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2024).\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.69.\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\nFirstly, we acknowledge that NVIDIA has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 14% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 39% net income growth seen by NVIDIA over the past five years isn't overly surprising.\nWe then compared NVIDIA's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 29% in the same 5-year period.\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if NVIDIA is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\nNVIDIA has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 5.2%, meaning that it has the remaining 95% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.\nBesides, NVIDIA has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 0.5% over the next three years. Still forecasts suggest that NVIDIA's future ROE will drop to 51% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to decrease. This suggests that there could be other factors could driving the anticipated decline in the company's ROE.\nOn the whole, we feel that NVIDIA's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s AMZN cloud-computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), extends its partnership with NVIDIA NVDA to power its portfolio with generative AI technology.NVIDIA Blackwell GPU platform, which was introduced at GTC 2024, will be available on AWS. Notably, the platform features GB200 NVL72, with 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs interconnected by fifth-generation NVIDIA NVLink.This will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion parameter language models.AWS strives to enable customers to explore new generative AI capabilities by delivering secured and advanced infrastructure, software and services. In this regard, AWS will offer NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and B100 Tensor Core GPUs.Apart from this, AWS intends to provide Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, backed by NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPU. These EC2 instances will feature the new B100 GPUs, which will be deployed in EC2 UltraClusters to accelerate generative AI training and inference.In addition, Blackwell will be integrated with AWS Nitro System, Elastic Fabric Adapter encryption and AWS Key Management Service. This will help in providing end-to-end control of the training data and model weights.Also, Amazon SageMaker will be integrated with NVIDIA NIM inference microservices as part of this collaboration to aid the price performance optimization of foundation models running on GPUs.\n\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nThe latest move bodes well for Amazon\u2019s concerted efforts to expand the AWS portfolio, which has been driving its cloud customer momentum. Moreover, AWS's strength has been acting as a key catalyst behind Amazon\u2019s growth. AMZN shares have returned 74.9% over a year.We believe that AWS\u2019s solid customer base, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google.Amazon, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in fourth-quarter 2023, per the latest Synergy Research Group data. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, AWS generated revenues of $24.2 billion (14% of total sales) in the same quarter, up 13% year over year.Microsoft, which accounted for 24% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $25.9 billion in revenues (41.7% of the total revenues), up 20% year over year in second-quarter fiscal 2024. The business is benefiting from the solid adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. The Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 30% year over year. Microsoft is also making strong efforts to power its cloud capabilities with generative AI.Google Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Growing generative AI capabilities in the cloud, increasing data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position. Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud acquired 11% of the market, and reported revenues of $9.19 billion (10.6% of the total revenues) in fourth-quarter 2023, up 25.7% year over year.\nThe extended collaboration with NVIDIA is in sync with Amazon\u2019s growing efforts toward bolstering its generative AI.AWS\u2019s announcement regarding the general availability of its fully managed service called Amazon Bedrock, which provides seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API, remains noteworthy.The company also made the Amazon Titan Embeddings model generally available. It added Meta\u2019s Llama 2 to Amazon Bedrock as a new model, which will be available through API.AWS offers a new capability of Amazon CodeWhisperer, which is designed to offer generative AI-powered customized code suggestions by leveraging an organization's internal codebase.Growing generative AI efforts are expected to aid Amazon in capitalizing on the immense growth prospects in the generative AI market.Per an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market\u2019s value is likely to hit $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.Amazon\u2019s solidifying prospects in this promising market are likely to instill investor optimism in the stock.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Think Nvidia Stock Is Too Expensive and in a Bubble? Here's an Incredibly Cheap Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Jumps Higher",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia\u00a0stock surged by a massive 276% in the past year as the company rode the booming demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are being deployed by major cloud service providers for training and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models, but in the wake of that stunning surge, some market watchers have doubts that its rally is going to be sustainable.\nThere are already concerns that Nvidia stock may be in a bubble. From rising competition to regulatory concerns to a potential decline in the demand for AI chips, there are multiple reasons why that pessimistic view is gaining adherents. And then there's the company's valuation. Nvidia trades at 38 times sales, which is way higher than its 5-year average multiple of 18.\nIts trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 78 is also substantially higher than the Nasdaq-100 index's average of 33. Nvidia's ability to sustain its outstanding growth could help it justify these expensive multiples, but conservative investors who are looking for ways to capitalize on the fast-growing AI market may want to look for cheaper options. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, fits the bill.\nThis semiconductor bellwether could be an ideal pick for investors who want to benefit from the proliferation of AI but are not comfortable with Nvidia's lofty valuations.\nAI is expected to impact numerous industries in the long run and add significantly to the global economy. PwC estimates that AI could boost the global economy by a whopping $15.7 trillion by 2030. The good part is that the impact of AI is driving gains in industries such as advertising and cybersecurity already. So to describe the AI industry as being in a bubble doesn't seem to be correct.\nSemiconductors play a central role in AI proliferation. Customers are deploying Nvidia's chips for training popular AI models such as ChatGPT. However, Nvidia is only the designer of its chips, as it is a fabless semiconductor company. The actual manufacturing of its GPUs is done by its foundry partner -- TSMC.\nWhat's more, Nvidia is not the only company that has turned to TSMC to manufacture AI chips. AMD, Intel, and Broadcom are also TSMC customers, and all of them are in a race to develop AI chips. So, it doesn't matter who wins the AI semiconductor race, TSMC will be a major beneficiary as these companies will be turning to the leading foundry to manufacture their chips.\nThis explains why TSMC has been rapidly expanding its capacity to manufacture AI chips. It has outlined a capital expenditure budget of $28 billion to $32 billion for 2024, and predicts that the robust demand for AI chips could help it increase its revenue by 20% this year. Analysts, however, are forecasting that TSMC will experience a 22% jump in revenue this year to more than $84 billion.\nAs the above chart shows, TSMC is expected to deliver healthy growth in 2025 as well. However, analysts seem to be forecasting a slowdown in its revenue growth in 2026. But it is worth noting that a recent MarketDigits report forecasts that the AI chip market will grow at an annualized rate of 38% through 2030. TSMC, therefore, could deliver better-than-expected growth in the long run.\nAnd finally, given the stock's valuation, buying it right now looks like a no-brainer.\nNvidia trades at rich multiples right now, though it deserves to command an expensive valuation considering that its revenue rose 265% year over year last quarter to $22.1 billion, and its earnings soared by 486% to $5.16 per share.\nTSMC isn't growing at such a stunning pace. But investors can buy it at 11 times sales right now -- a much cheaper valuation than Nvidia. Additionally, TSMC is trading at 29 times trailing earnings, making it cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 index's average multiple of 33 (using the index as a proxy for the tech sector).\nIf TSMC's revenues do rise to almost $111 billion in 2026, and if at that time, it trades at its five-year average sales multiple of 8.1, its market cap would be $899 billion. That would be an 18% gain from its current levels, but don't be surprised to see this AI stock delivering stronger gains as it seems capable of clocking stronger-than-expected growth, which could lead the market to reward it with a richer valuation.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Micron Technology",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Both Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) have been highly profitable investments in the past year, with their share prices rising rapidly thanks to the way artificial intelligence (AI) has supercharged their businesses.\nWhile Nvidia stock has gained 255% in the past year, Micron's gains stand at 91%. If you are looking to add one of these two AI stocks to your portfolio right now, which one should you be buying?\nNvidia has been the go-to supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for major cloud computing companies looking to train AI models. The demand for Nvidia's AI GPUs was so strong last year that its customers were waiting for as long as 11 months to get their hands on the company's hardware, according to investment bank UBS.\nNvidia's efforts to manufacture more AI chips and meet this heightened customer demand have been successful, allowing it to lower the wait time to three to four months. This goes some way to explaining why the company's growth has been stunning in recent quarters.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's revenue shot up a whopping 265% year over year to $22.1 billion. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings jumped 486% to $5.16 per share.\nThat eye-popping growth is set to continue in the current quarter. Nvidia's revenue estimate of $24 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 would translate into a year-over-year gain of 233%.\nAnalysts are expecting the company's earnings to jump to $5.51 per share in the current quarter, which would be a 5x increase over the year-ago period's reading of $1.09 per share. Even better, Nvidia should be able to sustain its impressive momentum for the rest of the fiscal year as well, especially since it expects the demand for its upcoming AI GPUs based on the Blackwell architecture to exceed supply.\nNvidia management pointed out on its February earnings conference call that, although the supply of its current-generation chips is improving, the next-generation products will be \"supply constrained.\" That won't be surprising, as Nvidia's upcoming AI GPUs, which will start shipping later in 2024, are reportedly four times more powerful when training AI models as compared to the current H100 processor.\nNvidia also expects a 30 times increase in the AI inference performance with its Blackwell AI GPUs. This should help it cater to a fast-growing segment of the AI chip market, as the market for AI inference chips is expected to grow from $16 billion in 2023 to $91 billion in 2030, according to reporting from Verified Market Research.\nThe good part is that customers are already lining up for Nvidia's Blackwell processors, with Meta Platforms expecting to train future generations of its Llama large language model (LLM) using the latest chips.\nAll this explains why analysts are forecasting Nvidia's earnings to increase from $12.96 per share in fiscal 2024 to almost $37 per share in fiscal 2027. That translates into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of almost 42%, suggesting that Nvidia could remain a top AI growth play going forward.\nThe booming demand for Nvidia's AI chips is turning out to be a solid tailwind for Micron Technology. That's because Nvidia's AI GPUs are powered by high-bandwidth memory (HBM) from the likes of Micron.\nOn its recent earnings conference call, Micron pointed out that Nvidia will be deploying its HBM chips in the H200 processors, which are set to be available to customers beginning in the second quarter. Micron management also added that it is \"making progress on additional platform qualifications with multiple customers.\"\nThe demand for Micron's HBM chips is so strong that it has sold out its entire capacity for 2024. What's more, the memory specialist says that \"the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply has already been allocated,\" indicating that AI will continue to drive robust demand for Micron's chips.\nMicron is also looking to push the envelope in the HBM market. The company has started sampling a new HBM chip with 50% higher memory, which will allow the likes of Nvidia to make more powerful AI chips going forward. As such, booming HBM demand will positively impact Micron's financials, with the company estimating that it will \"generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in fiscal 2024.\"\nThe HBM market is expected to generate almost $17 billion in revenue this year -- accounting for 20% of overall DRAM industry revenue -- as compared to $4.4 billion in 2023. Even better, it could keep getting bigger in the long run on the back of the fast-growing AI chip market. As a result, Micron should be able to sustain the impressive growth it has started clocking now.\nThe company's revenue in the recently reported fiscal second quarter of 2024 (which ended on Feb. 29) was up 57% year over year to $5.82 billion. The revenue guidance of $6.6 billion for the ongoing quarter would be a bigger jump of 76% from the year-ago period. So, Micron's aggressive AI-driven growth is just getting started.\nGiven the data above, Micron may turn out to be the better AI play compared to Nvidia because of one simple reason: At almost 37 times sales, Nvidia stock is way more expensive when compared to Micron's price-to-sales ratio of 6.4. Also, Micron is significantly cheaper than Nvidia as far as the forward earnings multiple is concerned.\nOf course, Nvidia is growing at a much faster pace than Micron, and it could justify its expensive valuation by sustaining its terrific growth. However, investors looking for a cheaper way to play the AI boom are likely to consider Micron for their portfolios, considering its attractive valuation and the rapid growth it offers right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

This goes some way to explaining why the company's growth has been stunning in recent quarters.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's revenue shot up a whopping 265% year over year to $22.1 billion. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings jumped 486% to $5.16 per share.\nThat eye-popping growth is set to continue in the current quarter. Nvidia's revenue estimate of $24 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 would translate into a year-over-year gain of 233%.\nAnalysts are expecting the company's earnings to jump to $5.51 per share in the current quarter, which would be a 5x increase over the year-ago period's reading of $1.09 per share. Even better, Nvidia should be able to sustain its impressive momentum for the rest of the fiscal year as well, especially since it expects the demand for its upcoming AI GPUs based on the Blackwell architecture to exceed supply.\nNvidia management pointed out on its February earnings conference call that, although the supply of its current-generation chips is improving, the next-generation products will be \"supply constrained.\" That won't be surprising, as Nvidia's upcoming AI GPUs, which will start shipping later in 2024, are reportedly four times more powerful when training AI models as compared to the current H100 processor.\nNvidia also expects a 30 times increase in the AI inference performance with its Blackwell AI GPUs. This should help it cater to a fast-growing segment of the AI chip market, as the market for AI inference chips is expected to grow from $16 billion in 2023 to $91 billion in 2030, according to reporting from Verified Market Research.\nThe good part is that customers are already lining up for Nvidia's Blackwell processors, with Meta Platforms expecting to train future generations of its Llama large language model (LLM) using the latest chips.\nAll this explains why analysts are forecasting Nvidia's earnings to increase from $12.96 per share in fiscal 2024 to almost $37 per share in fiscal 2027. That translates into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of almost 42%, suggesting that Nvidia could remain a top AI growth play going forward.\nThe booming demand for Nvidia's AI chips is turning out to be a solid tailwind for Micron Technology. That's because Nvidia's AI GPUs are powered by high-bandwidth memory (HBM) from the likes of Micron.\nOn its recent earnings conference call, Micron pointed out that Nvidia will be deploying its HBM chips in the H200 processors, which are set to be available to customers beginning in the second quarter. Micron management also added that it is \"making progress on additional platform qualifications with multiple customers.\"\nThe demand for Micron's HBM chips is so strong that it has sold out its entire capacity for 2024. What's more, the memory specialist says that \"the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply has already been allocated,\" indicating that AI will continue to drive robust demand for Micron's chips.\nMicron is also looking to push the envelope in the HBM market. The company has started sampling a new HBM chip with 50% higher memory, which will allow the likes of Nvidia to make more powerful AI chips going forward. As such, booming HBM demand will positively impact Micron's financials, with the company estimating that it will \"generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in fiscal 2024.\"\nThe HBM market is expected to generate almost $17 billion in revenue this year -- accounting for 20% of overall DRAM industry revenue -- as compared to $4.4 billion in 2023. Even better, it could keep getting bigger in the long run on the back of the fast-growing AI chip market. As a result, Micron should be able to sustain the impressive growth it has started clocking now.\nThe company's revenue in the recently reported fiscal second quarter of 2024 (which ended on Feb. 29) was up 57% year over year to $5.82 billion. The revenue guidance of $6.6 billion for the ongoing quarter would be a bigger jump of 76% from the year-ago period. So, Micron's aggressive AI-driven growth is just getting started.\nGiven the data above, Micron may turn out to be the better AI play compared to Nvidia because of one simple reason: At almost 37 times sales, Nvidia stock is way more expensive when compared to Micron's price-to-sales ratio of 6.4. Also, Micron is significantly cheaper than Nvidia as far as the forward earnings multiple is concerned.\nOf course, Nvidia is growing at a much faster pace than Micron, and it could justify its expensive valuation by sustaining its terrific growth. However, investors looking for a cheaper way to play the AI boom are likely to consider Micron for their portfolios, considering its attractive valuation and the rapid growth it offers right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is being supercharged by the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks of Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nWith the exception of Apple and Tesla, each of these AI stocks has handily beaten the S&P 500 over the last year. Nvidia stands out in a league of its own, however.\nThe stock is up nearly 260% in the last year, and the company has added a trillion dollars of market cap in less than 12 months. With such a meteoric rise, investors may be thinking that they've missed the boat.\nLet's dig into the current state of Nvidia's business and, more importantly, take a look at what catalysts could be in store for future growth. Now could be as good a time as ever to begin building a position in this monster AI stock.\nNvidia manufactures graphics processing units (GPU) that are used across an array of generative AI applications, including accelerated computing and machine learning. Demand for the company's flagship A100 and H100 chips is staggering, and it doesn't seem to be slowing down.\nNvidia recently reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2024, which ended Jan. 28. For the full year, the company generated $60.9 billion in revenue -- up 126% year over year. But what's even more encouraging is the company's margin expansion and profitability growth. \nIn fiscal 2024, Nvidia's gross margin was 72.7% -- an increase of nearly 16 percentage points over the prior year. On top of that, the company's free cash flow of $27 billion surged sixfold year over year.\nWith a financial performance like this, the music eventually has to stop, right? I wouldn't bank on that just yet.\nDespite Nvidia's record growth last year, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is that the ride could just be getting started.\nNvidia is expected to increase its top line by roughly 78% this year, followed by modest growth over the next couple of years. Admittedly, forecasting beyond one year can be more of an art than a science. As an investor, I'm not placing too much credence on estimates beyond fiscal 2025.\nOne of the reasons I'm suspicious that the estimates above could be conservative is that investors are now just learning about some intriguing new catalysts. For starters, news broke a couple of weeks ago that Nvidia is an investor in voice-recognition software company SoundHound AI.\nThe terms of the partnership are not entirely known. However, Nvidia is just the latest big tech company to explore AI-powered voice assistants. Cohorts including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have all invested significantly in similar technology -- thereby signaling that voice recognition could be a lucrative pocket of the overall AI landscape.\nIn addition, during the fourth-quarter earnings call, investors learned that Nvidia also has a budding enterprise software business. While it's still early innings for Nvidia on the software front, I see many reasons to be optimistic about this endeavor. Namely, it shows that the company is already expanding beyond semiconductor chips.\nMoreover, software tends to carry much higher margins than hardware development. Given that competition in semiconductor manufacturing will likely rise over the next few years, I wouldn't be surprised to see some margin deterioration, as Nvidia will likely lose some of its pricing power.\nNevertheless, it appears the company is already looking to outmaneuver such a dynamic by complementing its core data center operation with a software component.\nDuring fourth-quarter earnings, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a bold statement when he declared that \"accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point.\" On the surface, you might think this means Nvidia's rocket ship may be returning from orbit. But that's not the case.\nRather, Huang went on to explain his philosophy in further detail. He believes that the installed base for data center infrastructure could double within the next five years. Given Nvidia's commanding position in this market, combined with the catalysts outlined above, investors have several reasons to believe that there could be substantial upside in Nvidia stock.\nHans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities recently slapped a $1,400 price target on Nvidia stock -- implying roughly 60% upside from current trading levels. Whether or not Nvidia reaches this price, the bigger picture remains.\nAll things considered, secular trends fueling spend in artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to not only stay but actually rise significantly over the next several years. Given Nvidia's unique position across both hardware and software, coupled with an increasing number of use cases and applications, I see Nvidia's growth journey as just beginning.\nNow could be an interesting time to begin using dollar-cost averaging to build a position or add to an existing holding in Nvidia stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been anything but an under-the-radar stock over the last year. After blowing out sales estimates for three straight quarters, shares of the technology company have soared 265% over the last 12 months.\nNvidia is currently the clear leader in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) computing solutions; saying its powerful semiconductors are in high demand is an understatement. And even after the surge in the stock, there are still two good reasons to buy it now.\nNvidia offers a diversified portfolio of products. It makes chips for gaming and offers a cloud-based gaming service. Its omniverse platform helps businesses design and operate manufacturing processes, and the company also supplies the burgeoning autonomous driving industry. But the data center segment is what has investors most excited.\nRevenue from that segment grew 409% year over year in the company's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28). In that quarterly report, CEO Jensen Huang said: \"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations.\" As Huang has previously noted, the era of generative AI is clearly taking off.\nBut there looks to be plenty more growth to come. The market size for generative AI is projected to more than quadruple from the 2023 level by the end of this decade. Nvidia will be a big beneficiary of that growth.\nNvidia isn't just diversified with its products and services, it's also diversified geographically. As the graph below shows, continued sales growth doesn't just rely on the economy of any single country or region.\nEven though a global recession (or a decline in just one of its major markets) will affect Nvidia's performance, there is less risk for investors when sales are spread out geographically.\nThat helps stem some risk, and there are plenty of catalysts for more growth, too. Machine learning has been the major focus of AI development. That is likely to continue for at least several more years, but an increasing number of businesses in multiple sectors are also using AI technology.\nNvidia's automotive segment could also grow quickly if self-driving vehicles become more mainstream. Autonomous and sensor technology is just one more area beyond machine learning where its sales could jump in the future. That potential is yet another reason to own the stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become a candidate to overtake Microsoft and Apple as the largest company in the world. After starting 2023 being valued at around a $350 billion market cap, Nvidia is now worth about $2.2 trillion.\nThat's a dramatic expansion in value and it puts it within striking distance of Microsoft and Apple, which are valued at around $3.1 trillion and $2.6 trillion, respectively. It's still a sizable gap to close, but it may happen sooner than you think if the right circumstances occur.\nNvidia is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, as it provides the computing power necessary to make these models work. Its primary product, the GPU (graphics processing unit), excels at crunching through arduous workloads. GPUs are connected to create powerful supercomputers, which often have over 1,000 GPUs.\nWith Nvidia's flagship GPU, the H100, rumored to cost about $30,000, there's a lot of potential revenue for Nvidia. When AI demand started to take off during Nvidia's second quarter of 2023 (ending July 30, 2023), that's when its growth really started.\nIn the last three quarters, Nvidia's revenue more than tripled compared to the previous year's results. For the current quarter, which is first quarter of fiscal year 2025, that trend is also expected to continue as management projects $24 billion in revenue -- a 234% projected increase.\nAfter Q1, Nvidia will have harder comparisons. However, if it can maintain its revenue levels in the mid-$20 billion range, it will still post strong growth, as Q2 and Q3 of FY 2024 saw $13.5 billion and $18.1 billion in revenue, respectively.\nBut will that be enough to surpass Apple and Microsoft?\nIf Nvidia can achieve its projection of $24 billion in revenue in Q1 and barely grow quarter over quarter throughout the year to attain $100 billion in revenue for FY 2025, that could set Nvidia up nicely.\nUsing its Q4 profit margin of 55% as a baseline, Nvidia would produce $55 billion in profits. But how does that compare to Microsoft and Apple?\nThe chart below shows the trailing 12-month (TTM) total of each company's net income. So, even if Nvidia achieves $55 billion in annual profit, it would still be far behind Microsoft and Apple.\nFor Nvidia to surpass either company, investors would have to place a significant premium on the stock, reflected in an expensive price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Nvidia's P/E ratio is already much higher than that of Microsoft or Apple, as it trades for 77 times earnings versus Microsoft's 38 and Apple's 27.\nIf Nvidia kept its 77 times earnings price tag with $55 billion in profit, it would be valued at $4.24 trillion, easily surpassing Microsoft as the world's largest company. But that isn't likely.\nNvidia's stock is valued at a premium because investors know that this figure will come down as it grows into its newfound business. So, the only way Nvidia will maintain its 77 times earnings premium at the end of this fiscal year is if it continues doubling or tripling its revenue each quarter.\nIf Nvidia does that, it will have earned the title of the world's largest company. This seems a far stretch, considering that many GPU orders have already been placed.\nWill Nvidia overtake Microsoft or Apple in valuation? I'd say it's unlikely. But Nvidia has produced uncommon growth for the last three quarters, and if that trend continues over the next year, it has a shot at capturing the title of the world's largest company.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "There's a shortage of high-powered chips capable of training and running advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. Mega-tech companies are battling each other for AI supremacy, scooping up boatloads of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) data center GPUs along the way, and AI start-ups with rocketing valuations are multiplying.\nThere's little question that AI is a revolutionary technology. There's also little question, at least in my mind, that AI is fueling a classic bubble. Start-ups founded less than a year ago, like Mistral AI, are already worth billions. Some publicly traded companies, notably server maker Super Micro Computer, have seen their valuations skyrocket to levels that seem illogical. Caution is increasingly being thrown to the wind.\nNvidia and its GPUs are at the center of it all. Not only are the company's GPUs well suited for the calculations necessary for training and running AI models, but its proprietary CUDA platform has become the de facto standard for accelerated computing over the past 16 years. With companies scrambling to win the AI race, Nvidia's GPUs are the path of least resistance.\nIt's not surprising then that demand for Nvidia's AI accelerators has exploded. The company's data center segment generated $18.4 billion of revenue in its latest quarter, a fivefold increase from the prior-year period. Profits are soaring as well. In the recently completed fiscal 2024, Nvidia earned a net income of $32.3 billion of $60.9 billion of revenue.\nNvidia stock has more than tripled over the past year, pushing up the company's market capitalization beyond $2 trillion.\n\"I've seen gluts not followed by shortages, but I've never seen a shortage not followed by a glut,\" says Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who is regarded as an expert on risk. The inertia behind Nvidia's CUDA has slowed down competitors, but a tsunami of competing AI accelerators is building. Nvidia's incredible profits and pricing power won't survive once supply catches up with demand.\nAdvanced Micro Devices launched new AI-centric data center GPUs late last year. Intel will launch the third generation of its capable Gaudi line of AI accelerators this year. OpenAI's Sam Altman is reportedly seeking vast funding for new semiconductor factories to build AI chips. Cloud giants including Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are designing and installing their own AI chips. The list goes on.\nHere's how the current shortage turns into a glut. First, insatiable demand and extravagant long-term projections drive a wave of competition. This is what's happening now. AMD has predicted that the AI chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. For perspective, global semiconductor sales were just over $500 billion last year.\nSecond, future demand inevitably falls short of these wild projections. AI chip demand can still soar in the coming years and miss expectations, given how optimistic industry players have become. Eventually, this leads to a situation where there's more than enough supply of AI chips.\nAt this point, Nvidia's pricing power would have eroded considerably. CUDA would no longer be dominant as alternatives pop up and gain traction. For big cloud companies, there's a strong incentive to be able to support AI accelerators from a wide variety of suppliers.\nThis isn't the first time Nvidia's stock has soared thanks to a revolutionary technology. The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s pushed up the company's valuation to extreme levels as well. The aftermath was a disaster for shareholders.\nRelative to sales, Nvidia stock is far more expensive today than at any point during the dot-com bubble. \"This time is different,\" you might say. Demand for AI is real, and the company's revenue is soaring. But you've just uttered the four most dangerous words in investing.\nThis time might be different. Or the market dynamics that play out during nearly every shortage of anything will play out once again and grind down Nvidia's pricing power and profits. By investing in Nvidia, you'll likely be paying a high price to relearn the lessons of the dot-com bubble.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Exclusive-Behind the plot to break Nvidia's grip on AI by targeting software",
        "Author": "  Max A. Cherney ",
        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Nvidia earned its $2.2 trillion market cap by producing artificial-intelligence chips that have become the lifeblood powering the new era of generative AI developers from startups to Microsoft, OpenAI and Google parent Alphabet.\nAlmost as important to its hardware is the company's nearly 20 years' worth of computer code, which helps make competition with the company nearly impossible. More than 4 million global developers rely on Nvidia's CUDA software platform to build AI and other apps.\nNow a coalition of tech companies that includes Qualcomm, Google and Intel plans to loosen Nvidia\u2019s chokehold by going after the chip giant\u2019s secret weapon: the software that keeps developers tied to Nvidia chips. They are part of an expanding group of financiers and companies hacking away at Nvidia's dominance in AI.\n\"We're actually showing developers how you migrate out from an Nvidia platform,\" Vinesh Sukumar, Qualcomm's head of AI and machine learning, said in an interview with Reuters.\nStarting with a piece of technology developed by Intel called OneAPI, the UXL Foundation, a consortium of tech companies, plans to build a suite of software and tools that will be able to power multiple types of AI accelerator chips, executives involved with the group told Reuters. The open-source project aims to make computer code run on any machine, regardless of what chip and hardware powers it.\n\"It's about specifically - in the context of machine learning frameworks - how do we create an open ecosystem, and promote productivity and choice in hardware,\" Google's director and chief technologist of high-performance computing, Bill Magro, told Reuters in an interview. Google is one of the founding members of UXL and helps determine the technical direction of the project, Magro said.\nUXL's technical steering committee is preparing to nail down technical specifications in the first half of this year. Engineers plan to refine the technical details to a \"mature\" state by the end of the year, executives said. These executives stressed the need to build a solid foundation to include contributions from multiple companies that can also be deployed on any chip or hardware.\nBeyond the initial companies involved, UXL will court cloud-computing companies such as Amazon.com and Microsoft's Azure, as well as additional chipmakers.\nSince its launch in September, UXL has already begun to receive technical contributions from third parties that include foundation members and outsiders keen on using the open-source technology, the executives involved said. Intel's OneAPI is already useable, and the second step is to create a standard programming model of computing designed for AI.\nUXL plans to put its resources toward addressing the most pressing computing problems dominated by a few chipmakers, such as the latest AI apps and high-performance computing applications. Those early plans feed in to the organization's longer-term goal of winning over a critical mass of developers to its platform.\nUXL eventually aims to support Nvidia hardware and code, in the long run.\nWhen asked about the open source and venture-funded software efforts to break Nvidia\u2019s AI dominance, Nvidia executive Ian Buck said in a statement: \"The world is getting accelerated. New ideas in accelerated computing are coming from all across the ecosystem, and that will help advance AI and the scope of what accelerated computing can achieve.\"\nNvidia shares gained 0.8% to close at $950.02 on Monday.\nNEARLY 100 STARTUPS\nThe UXL Foundation's plans are one of many efforts to chip away at Nvidia's hold on the software that powers AI. Venture financiers and corporate dollars have poured more than $4 billion into 93 separate efforts, according to custom data compiled by PitchBook at Reuters\u2019 request.\nThe interest in unseating Nvidia through a potential weakness in software has ramped up in the last year, and startups aiming to poke holes in the company's leadership gobbled up just over $2 billion in 2023 compared with $580 million from a year ago, according to the data from PitchBook.\nSuccess in the shadow of Nvidia's group on AI data crunching is an achievement that few of the startups will be able to achieve. Nvidia's CUDA is a compelling piece of software on paper, as it is full-featured and is consistently growing both from Nvidia's contributions and the developer community.\n\"But that's not what really matters,\" said Jay Goldberg, chief executive of D2D Advisory, a finance and strategy consulting firm. \"What matters is the fact that people have been using CUDA for 15 years, they built code around it.\"\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "Author": "  Yiannis Zourmpanos ",
        "Text": "In terms of technology investments, the hunt for the next game-changing entity similar to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains perpetual. Yet, within the sector, three formidable contenders have emerged that may disrupt the status quo and redefine growth. While diverse in their focus areas within the tech domain, these disruptive tech stocks for growth share a common plinth of exponential profitability.\nThe first one delivers financial stability with a solid framework characterized by prudent debt management, steadfast revenue streams, and high free cash flow generation. Meanwhile, the second captivates the market with its meteoric rise in top-line growth. The growth is propelled by a surge in profitability and meticulous cost optimization strategies. In parallel, the third one solidifies its position with a focus on the operational edge. This can be observed in enhanced operating margins, segment profitability, and high EPS growth.\nBeyond these metrics, adaptability and strategic acumen define the very essence of these tech titans. Explore these three disruptors that may catalyze a seismic shift in the tech investment space.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSource: TierneyMJ / Shutterstock.com\nConsensus Cloud (NASDAQ:CCSI), a SaaS company, reports strong free cash flow (FCF) generation and debt management, stable revenue base, and cost containment breed its value growth potential.\nIn Q4 2023, Consensus Cloud derived\u00a0$47.2 million\u00a0in adjusted EBITDA with a margin of 53.8%, consistent with its forecasted range of 50%-55%. This indicates sharp cost management and revenue generation capabilities, which lead to positive cash flow generation.\nFurthermore, throughout 2023, Consensus Cloud focused on debt reduction moves, utilizing its FCF for debt reduction. The company repurchased $71.4 million of bonds through January at an average price of 91% of par. This strategic debt reduction improves the company\u2019s flexibility but also reduces the interest burden. Hence, this may further solidify valuation growth potential.\nDespite facing challenges in top-line growth, Consensus Cloud holds a stable revenue base throughout 2023 year-over-year (YOY), with revenues of\u00a0$362.6 million. This stability is vital considering the decline in revenues in Q4, indicating adaptability in managing market fluctuations. In Q4 2023, while consolidated revenues dropped by 2.7% YOY, the company strategically managed costs to hold profitability.\nAdditionally, the company eliminated inefficient marketing spending and optimized campaigns. As a result, Consensus Cloud improved EBITDA productivity and margin, minimizing the impact of revenue declines.\nMoreover, CCSI\u2019s focus on the corporate business yielded positive results, with revenues hitting $49.4 million in Q4 2023. This represents a\u00a03.3% YOY increase,\u00a0which marks the edge of the company\u2019s strategic moves to drive growth in its revenue segments.\nFinally, Consensus Cloud ended 2023 with $88.7 million in cash, suggesting high liquidity and stability. Overall, the company utilized its cash reserves for debt repurchases and strategic investments, which improved flexibility and reduced interest expenses.\nSource: ArtemisDiana/Shutterstock\nGigaCloud (NASDAQ:GCT), a B2B e-commerce solutions provider, has consistently delivered high top-line growth. The consolidated revenues increased by\u00a039.2% YOY,\u00a0hitting $178.2 million in Q3 2023. This considerable growth indicates the company\u2019s capability to capture market demand sharply and expand its top-line performance.\nFundamentally, the top-line growth was based on increased demand for large parcel merchandise. This results in higher GigaCloud Marketplace gross merchandise value (GMV), sales volume, and the number of sellers and buyers. The growth momentum suggests that GigaCloud is rapidly capitalizing on market demand and attracting a larger customer base to its platform.\nOne of the most striking aspects of GigaCloud\u2019s performance is the exponential surge in profitability. The net income soared by an astonishing\u00a03,357.1% YOY,\u00a0hitting $24.2 million in Q3. Such a massive boost in profitability suggests the company\u2019s operational edge, scalability, and capability to derive considerable earnings.\nTowards the bottom line, GigaCloud has considerably improved its gross margin over the comparative period. The gross profit surged by 117.3% YOY, hitting $48.9 million in Q3 2023. The gross margin correspondingly increased from 17.6% to 27.4%. The expansion in gross margin is based on the continued return to normalization of ocean shipping rates from their all-time highs in H1 2022.\nFinally, this indicates that GigaCloud effectively managed its cost of goods sold (COGS) and optimized pricing strategies, leading to higher profitability per unit sold. Another metric reflecting GigaCloud\u2019s performance is its adjusted EBITDA growth, which surged by\u00a0150.4% YOY\u00a0to $29.8 million in Q3 2023. Hence, this indicates considerable operational efficiency improvements and effective cost controls.\nSource: Shutterstock\nCelestica (NYSE:CLS), a supply chain solutions provider, has a solid bottom line that supports its valuation expansion. For instance, Celestica\u2019s non-IFRS operating margin reached\u00a06.0% in Q4 2023, an increase from 5.3% in Q4 2022. This improvement indicates Celestica\u2019s lead in controlling costs and optimizing operational processes.\nIn Q4, the Communication Solutions (CCS) segment margin expanded to 6.7% (5.9% in Q4 2022), indicating boosted segment profitability. Similarly, the Advanced Technology Solutions (ATS) segment margin increased to 4.7% in Q4 (4.4% last year), signaling enhanced efficiency despite a revenue decline.\nAdditionally, in Q4, Celestica delivered non-IFRS-adjusted\u00a0EPS of 76 cents, a considerable increase from 56 cents in Q4 2022. This growth in EPS marks Celestica\u2019s capability to derive higher EPS through an improved operational edge. Furthermore, Celestica\u2019s 2023 non-IFRS adjusted EPS was $2.43, representing a notable 28% increase YOY. This considerable growth signifies Celestica\u2019s constant performance and its capacity to derive value over the long term.\nMoreover, the increase in adjusted EPS is based on multiple factors. These include higher non-IFRS operating earnings, lower interest costs, a more favorable non-IFRS adjusted tax rate, and a lower outstanding share base. Hence, these factors reflect Celestica\u2019s efforts to enrich profitability and optimize its capital structure to uplift EPS.\nFinally, the high return on invested capital (ROIC) reflects Celestica\u2019s high edge in deriving returns from its invested capital. In Q4, Celestica delivered an adjusted\u00a0ROIC of 23.3%, reflecting a considerable YOY improvement (20.7% in Q4 2022). Therefore, this increase in ROIC reflects Celestica\u2019s capability to derive higher returns on the capital deployed in its operations and breed higher valuations.\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Author": "  Lewis Krauskopf ",
        "Text": "By Lewis Krauskopf\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Money managers are scrambling to cash in on the stock market\u2019s interest in artificial intelligence, as a stunning rally by Nvidia sparks a search for other companies that are capitalizing on the technology.\nShares of Nvidia - whose chips are the gold standard in the AI industry - are up about 60% this year after tripling in 2023. The run has pushed its market value to roughly $2 trillion, making it the third-largest U.S. company by market cap after Microsoft and Apple.\nIt has also spurred Wall Street to search for other AI-focused companies in hopes of catching outsized moves. Whether investors are looking at the broader chip industry or betting on firms elsewhere in the value chain, they agree on one thing: AI is here to stay.\n\u201cIt's not a fad,\" said Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager for F/m Investments' Large Cap Focused Fund. \"There are too many ... cases where companies can make really good use of the technology to enhance both their top and bottom lines.\u201d\nExcitement over AI helped power the Nasdaq Composite Index to a record high on Thursday, while the S&P 500 also marked its latest record. The indexes are both up about 7% this year.\nFurther signs of the growing fixation on AI have been easy to spot. Mentions of AI on conference calls reached a new high in the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs said recently. The bank\u2019s analysts have estimated artificial intelligence technology could add 1.5 percentage points to U.S. productivity growth if there is widespread adoption over the next decade.\nA Morgan Stanley survey of chief information officers suggests 2024 is \"a Year of Investment for AI,\" the bank said in a note this week, with CIOs naming AI/machine learning as their top priority for the first time.\nBido\u2019s fund retains a large holding in Nvidia, but has branched out into other AI plays, including rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices and MongoDB, whose database products could be in high demand as AI is poised to change data infrastructure needs.\nThose stocks have risen sharply, although less dramatically, than Nvidia and some other AI plays that have recently captured the market's attention. AMD shares are up 30% year-to-date, for example, while Mongo\u2019s have risen 9%, though the shares of both companies doubled last year.\nBy contrast, shares of server component supplier Super Micro Computer and chip designer ARM Holding have jumped about 200% and 90%, respectively, in 2024. SMCI's shares tripled in 2023.\nIvana Delevska, founder and chief investment officer of Spear Invest, said Nvidia has remained the biggest holding in its Spear Alpha ETF. But the exchange-traded fund has also sought to capitalize on growing cybersecurity needs related to AI by owning shares of Zscaler, a cybersecurity specialist. The fund's position in Snowflake, meanwhile, seeks to take advantage of data infrastructure demands.\nOf course, the risks of playing the often-volatile stocks of AI-related companies remain despite the technology\u2019s higher profile. Shares of Snowflake, for example, fell 18% on Thursday after the company projected annual revenue below Wall Street estimates and disclosed the unexpected retirement its CEO.\nBaker Avenue Wealth Management trimmed its Nvidia holding as the stock has climbed so that it does not occupy too large a position in client portfolios, said King Lip, the firm\u2019s chief strategist.\nBut the firm recently started building a position in Taiwan Semiconductor, a key supplier to Nvidia.\n\"If you still want artificial intelligence exposure but are perhaps a little skittish about Nvidia\u2019s stock price, I think Taiwan Semi is kind of a no brainer,\u201d Lip said.\nQue Nguyen, chief investment officer of equities at Research Affiliates, is looking for reasonably valued semiconductor companies that could stand to benefit from AI. Among them are Lam Research Corp, which supplies equipment to the semiconductor industry, and Micron Technology, which makes memory chips and data storage.\nLam Research shares are up about 20% so far this year, while Micron is up 6%.\n\u201cLarge language models are not just processing, you need to have storage,\u201d Nguyen said.\nOf course, many investors are happy sticking with big Nvidia positions.\nThe Martin Currie US Unconstrained Fund has nearly 10% of its assets - the maximum the fund allows for one stock - in Nvidia, said portfolio manager Zehrid Osmani. He believes the company will maintain competitive advantages as it spends more heavily than rivals on research and development.\n\"We have high conviction in the name, and that's expressed through high position size,\" Osmani said.\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Additional reporting by David Randall in New York; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Johnson & Johnson\u2019s JNJ wholly-owned subsidiary, Johnson & Johnson MedTech, recently announced its partnership with Nvidia to accelerate secure, real-time analysis of surgical data using artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe two businesses collaborated to enable more global availability of AI algorithms and real-time analytical access. Their goal is to have an impact on surgical decision-making, teamwork, and education in all linked operating rooms (ORs).\nFor the past six months, JNJ\u2019s shares have lost 0.3% compared with the industry\u2019s decline of 2.3%. The S&P 500 increased 12.0% in the same time frame.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPer the press release, Johnson & Johnson and Nvidia signed a memorandum of understanding to use Nvidia's AI platform for healthcare. The company is planning to accelerate AI for its broad surgical MedTech technologies portfolio. Through its digital surgery ecosystem, Johnson & Johnson MedTech claimed that the technologies enable quick, safe, and real-time AI implementation.\nThe companies believe that the key to speeding up AI surgery is enhanced edge computing, which enables localized data processing in the OR. This allows for real-time analysis of stored and live surgical data by AI algorithms. According to Johnson & Johnson MedTech, the strategy may also lessen the requirement for sensitive data transfers.\nEnhanced computing also permits the execution of particular apps independently within the safe computing environment.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Investors in NVIDIA Corporation NVDA need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 20, 2024 $10.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for NVIDIA shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, NVIDIA is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Semiconductor - General industry that ranks in the Bottom 33% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, 10 analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $4.64 per share to $5.35 in that period.\nGiven the way analysts feel about NVIDIA right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock currently trades about 8.7% below its 52-week high of $974, but Wedbush analysts believe it could hit new highs sooner than later.\nWedbush Securities raised its price target from $850 to $1,000, representing a 12% upside from the current share price of $890. Analysts at the firm anticipate positive news from Nvidia at next week's Global Technology Conference (GTC) will boost the stock.\nNvidia usually reveals important news about partnerships and demand trends in the data center market that could be beneficial to the business. Of course, the question is how much growth is already factored into the stock price after surging 590% over the last three years.\nAnalysts expect Nvidia to report year-over-year revenue growth of 273% to reach $24.3 billion in the April-ending fiscal first quarter. Earnings per share are expected to grow even faster as strong demand for high-end chips boosts the company's margins. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 74. However, using analysts' earnings estimates for this year, the forward P/E drops to a more reasonable 36.\nNvidia stock is expensive, but the business is growing rapidly. There's room for the shares to move higher depending on the company's outlook beyond the next quarter.\nThis is why Wedbush might be right about positive news from GTC benefiting the stock. Analysts will be listening to any insights about demand trends for data center products, which made up 83% of the business last quarter.\nStill, whatever direction the stock moves in the next few months will pale in comparison to the stock's performance over the next several years.

        "Author": "  Sasha Rogelberg ",
        "Text": "Abercrombie & Fitch is \u201cno longer a jeans and T-shirt brand,\u201d CEO Fran Horowitz boasted on Wednesday\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call. The apparel retailer soared on a 21% increase in 2023 sales of $1.45 billion\u2014up from $1.2 billion the year before\u2014but tepid sales growth predictions for 2024 have halted its skyrocketing stock. Following the earnings report, shares fell 9.7% in Abercrombie\u2019s worst week since August 2022.\nThe retailer expects net sales growth from 4% to 6% for fiscal 2024, in line with estimates but lower than last year. Concerns over Abercrombie\u2019s ability to sustain revenue growth have caused shares to sink, Bloomberg reported.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Alex Straton said in a March 7 note that Abercrombie\u2019s profitability expectations could be too optimistic. Fashion brands, which rely on cyclical seasons and trends, are vulnerable to missteps, should they miss the mark on product rollout.\n\u201cThe risk-reward skews to the downside from current levels... We caution current growth and profitability levels could be difficult to maintain heading into [the second half of the year],\u201d she said.\nAbercrombie reached high highs in 2023, with its performance landing it at the top of the S&P 1500 Index. It gained 285%, higher than AI darling Nvidia\u2019s 239% surge. The retailer owes its sales success to revamping its inventory to appeal to younger shoppers, as well as customers who don\u2019t mind inflation-induced higher prices.\nHorowitz said the company intends to continue to lean on its expanding audience of both older Gen Zers and young millennials for future growth.\n\u201cThe addressable market has gone from customers in their early twenties to late thirties, and we've broadened all the offerings from a category perspective,\u201d Horowitz said. Abercrombie has launched both special occasion, casual, and activewear lines to dress young people for their weekend endeavors.\nYoung generations have a strong interest in clothing with 87% of Gen Z, as well as 82% of millennials, planning to buy fashion items over the next six months, according to a February UNiDays survey of over 5,000 UK students. While Gen Z is cost-conscious and thrifty, they also don\u2019t mind splurging a little extra on luxury goods. Gen Z and millennials are the generations most likely to make splurge purchases, including pricier fashion items. A June 2023 Harris Poll of over 2000 U.S. adults found that 75% of Gen Z and 68% of millennials made splurge purchases last year.\nBut even young fashion enthusiasts may not be able to reverse the trends of uncertainty in the fashion industry. McKinsey & Company\u2019s State of Fashion 2024 report predicts a 2% to 4% \u201cslower but normalized\u201d growth in the industry as a result of inflation and lack of consumer confidence. The Bureau of Labor Statistics noted a 0.6% uptick this month in CPI for urban consumers in apparel.\nThe fashion industry may have an uncertain future, but Abercrombie has built back from hardships in the past. A decade ago, the company was struggling to remain relevant and liked.\nOnly eight years before being the highest-performing stock, Abercrombie earned the 2016 superlative of most hated retailer. Previously the company leaned on the appeal of low-rise jeans and hypersexualized models, but its image soured after a slate of controversies, including a class-action racial discrimination lawsuit and comments by former CEO Mike Jeffries calling the retailer \u201cexclusionary\u201d in a 2006 interview.\nHorowitz, who became Abercrombie\u2019s CEO in 2017, actively worked to change the company\u2019s cliquey reputation perpetuated by her predecessor.\n\u201cWe are a positive, inclusive brand, with a nice sensibility, very different from what they encountered in the past,\u201d Horowitz said in 2016.\nBy 2019, Abercrombie had completely overhauled its inventory and expanded its sizes. Stores ditched the loud music and thick clouds of perfume. In a bid to separate itself from sister brand Hollister, it moved away from dressing teens in favor of pursuing young graduates and adults entering the workforce.\nThe strategy worked. In November 2022, the company posted an expectation-exceeding profit, even in the aftershocks of the pandemic and high inflation. Over the past five years, it has more than tripled its market capitalization, which grew from $1.83 billion in March 2019 to nearly $6 billion.\n\u201cWe grew up Abercrombie,\u201d Horowitz said in a 2022 Fortune interview. \u201cWe really focused on this young millennial, this young, mid-twenties consumer, and we got the response that we were hoping for.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "It would take time to find a stock that has skyrocketed as much as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has recently. Thanks to heightened interest (or more like a craze) in companies at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI), this stock has soared 271% in the last 12 months and a whopping 2,170% just in the past five years.\nFor those who have watched from the sidelines, it's understandable if you think it's too late to get in on the action. After all, Nvidia is currently a $2.2 trillion enterprise.\nBut don't be discouraged. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), an innovative business at the leading edge of the internet for more than two decades, might just be the best AI stock to buy and hold.\nNvidia sells chips that power data centers which support AI functions, and it counts some big tech corporations as its customers. It's OK if the latest financials have you picking up your jaw from the floor. Nvidia reported revenue growth of 126% in 2023. Even more impressive, operating income surged 686%.\nThis company is looking at a truly massive opportunity. On a global basis, the AI market is forecast to rise 800% by the end of the decade. Based on its financial results thus far, it's hard to deny that Nvidia is in a powerful position to benefit from this tech trend.\nNvidia's monster rise in the last few years has now made it the world's third-most valuable business. And the shares, unsurprisingly, look expensive. They trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 74. That's a lofty valuation, even when you factor in Nvidia's growth prospects.\nWhile it might be tempting to want to ride this momentum to strong portfolio returns, the enthusiasm surrounding the company these days might leave zero margin of safety for prospective investors. There's another compelling opportunity to take advantage of today.\nNvidia deserves credit, that's for sure. But don't sleep on Alphabet. The FAANG stock has dropped 14% since hitting a new all-time high in late January. This means investors can scoop up shares at a compelling P/E multiple of about 23. That seems like a no-brainer decision.\nIt's best not to forget that this business is one of the early pioneers of AI, introducing the technology in Google Search in 2001. Back then, AI helped users improve their spelling when making search queries.\nAlphabet's progress has been notable. In late 2016, CEO Sundar Pichai proclaimed that the company would be \"AI-first.\" This was six years before the famous launch of ChatGPT, which started the AI craze currently underway.\n\"In the next 10 years, we will shift to a world that is AI-first, a world where computing becomes universally available -- be it at home, at work, in the car, or on the go -- and interacting with all of these surfaces becomes much more natural and intuitive, and above all, more intelligent,\" Pichai wrote in a blog post more than seven years ago.\nThe fact that consumers probably don't realize that Alphabet has already integrated AI into its various products and services is indicative of how the business has seamlessly executed its strategy. Whether it's Gmail, Photos, Maps, or YouTube, AI permeates through. \nAnd when it comes to Google Cloud, which is a back-end infrastructure provider to enterprise and government clients, Alphabet has ample opportunity to move the needle forward with AI. There are already numerous features available to customers, be it generative AI, machine learning, language, or other areas.\nIn the last 24 months, Alphabet generated $203 billion of operating cash flow. And as of Dec. 31, the company had nearly $100 billion of net cash on the books. This puts Alphabet in a league of its own when it comes to having the financial resources to continue investing aggressively in AI capabilities. It will be hard for others to keep up.\nNvidia is getting all the attention these days. But investors need to consider Alphabet as a smart buying opportunity right now. It's in a favorable position to benefit over the long term from the AI boom.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "South China Morning Post ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's recent warning to developers about running its CUDA software, a programming toolkit, on third-party graphic processing units (GPUs) has exposed another weak link in China's quest for chip self-sufficiency: its dependence on the US chip giant's software.\nCUDA is a computing platform developed by Nvidia, which allows its GPU users to make best use of its chips in artificial intelligence (AI) and other applications.\nIntel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), the world's leading developers of computer central processing units, have also supported an open-source software project that enables their GPUs to run on CUDA.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nNvidia recently added a warning to its end-user license agreement for CUDA 11.6, requesting developers not to run CUDA on third-party GPUs via \"translation layers\"- software that converts one set of codes into another - on non-Nvidia hardware systems. It was the first time Nvidia has included such an explicit warning in the downloaded version of CUDA, according to a report by Tom's Hardware on Tuesday.\nThe move may potentially affect some Chinese GPU makers' ability to use CUDA code in their hardware, according to several Chinese developers.\nAfter Washington restricted exports of Nvidia's advanced GPUs to China, Chinese GPU companies have been working to develop their own alternatives, relying on CUDA as one of the software tools to improve GPU performance.\nNvidia's updated CUDA agreement comes as it is being touted as the world's hottest company amid a global AI frenzy, with Big Tech firms and start-ups alike scrambling to get a hold of its GPUs. At the same time, Nvidia's low-end GPUs face competition from rivals in China.\n\"CUDA plays a crucial role in Nvidia's ecosystem, which helps it lock in its customer base,\" said Su Lian Jye, chief analyst with research firm Omdia. \"It has become a crucial tool for many AI developers ... if the compatibility with CUDA was undermined, the costs of integrating codes will be so much higher.\"\nHowever, Chinese GPU firms said the immediate impact would be limited.\nMoore Threads, a Chinese GPU start-up blacklisted by Washington last October, said in a statement on Tuesday that its home-grown GPU architecture MUSA, and developers using its MUSIFY tool kit, were not affected by the Nvidia change.\n\"Developers can be assured of using our software, which is not applicable to Nvidia's ... clauses,\" the statement said.\nA senior engineer at Nvidia China, who declined to be named, downplayed the move, saying it was \"just a warning in the user agreement.\" It was not an actual ban that \"will cause disruptions to many projects\", he told the South China Morning Post.\nNvidia declined to comment on Wednesday.\nDespite the progress being made by Chinese GPU start-ups, their shortcomings in software are proving a hurdle when trying to compete with foreign companies like Nvidia.\nMany Chinese GPU companies have made their hardware more compatible with CUDA to win more market share by reducing software development costs for customers jumping to a new hardware platform.\nLast December during its launch of the MTT S4000 GPU, Moore Threads said its home-grown AI training card can leverage the CUDA ecosystem to enable zero-cost migration of CUDA code to the MUSA platform.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Text": "For crypto investors, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the one stock to watch for clues about the future direction of artificial intelligence (AI) crypto tokens. As Nvidia's stock goes, so goes the market for AI crypto tokens.\nSo with Nvidia shares surging after a monster earnings report in February, AI crypto tokens are also surging. Some are up 300% during the past month, and it all stems from a renewed sense of excitement around the AI market. But are any of these AI crypto tokens actually worth buying?\nRecognizing that it's still the very early innings for artificial intelligence, the one AI crypto token that has my attention right now is Fetch.ai (CRYPTO: FET), which is up almost 400% in the past 30 days and nearly 300% for the year. As of March 7, Fetch.ai had a market cap of $2.2 billion and ranked 51st among all cryptos in terms of overall market cap.\nThe goal of the token is to build, deploy, and monetize AI by creating an open network for AI agents. That's a mouthful, but all it really means is that Fetch.ai wants to offer a marketplace for paid AI services.\nAnytime you need a task fulfilled by an AI bot, you would theoretically go to the Fetch.ai marketplace and hire the right one to do the job for you. You would then use the Fetch crypto token to pay for the service.\nWhat makes Fetch.ai so interesting is that it sounds very similar to the concept for the new ChatGPT Store, which now enables you to hire customized AI bots to do certain tasks for you. Given that a lot more people know about ChatGPT than Fetch.ai, I'm not entirely convinced that the crypto should be worth $2.2 billion, but you can start to see why some investors are getting excited about its long-term prospects.\nWhere things get interesting is if Fetch.ai can sell enterprises (i.e., huge corporations) on the concept of these AI bots. One new partner is Deutsche Telekom, which is looking at potential uses for AI bots.\nThis could become a great example of AI bots providing utility on a vast scale, and it ties back to the whole idea of investing in Nvidia in the first place. After all, big blue chips like Deutsche Telekom are the ones that are going to be buying Nvidia's semiconductors and using its data centers.\nYou definitely need to be doing your due diligence in this sector if you want to benefit from the long-term convergence of AI and crypto. Otherwise, you could wind up in the same situation as we saw with metaverse crypto tokens back in 2021-22.\nInvestors sensed a huge market opportunity around the metaverse, and a few big metaverse crypto tokens eventually attained billion-dollar market caps. But nobody these days is buying metaverse crypto tokens.\nAnd that's because metaverse crypto tokens never figured out how to appeal to more than young gamers and early tech adopters. Big brands set up shop in the metaverse, hoping to find new customers and new sources of revenue, but things never really turned out as planned.\nAnd that's one concern that I have about Fetch.ai. Sure, the idea of using paid AI bots sounds great, but will it ever appeal to a mainstream audience? It would be great to see more examples of people actually using Fetch.ai bots in their daily lives.\nIf forced to pick just one AI crypto token right now, it would be Fetch.ai. For a little more than $2 per token, you can theoretically gain access to nearly unlimited upside if the use case for autonomous AI agents in the enterprise market plays out as expected.\nThat said, it might be better for risk-averse investors to focus on blue chip names in the AI market such as Nvidia rather than trying to make speculative bets on AI crypto tokens they have never heard of. Picking winners in an emerging tech market is always dicey, and so for now, I'm sticking with Nvidia, up more than 80% for the year, as the best way to play the future in AI.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "2 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks (not Named Nvidia) to Buy Right Now",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The AI bull market is here. Stocks are back at all-time highs, thanks largely to a new boom in artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe launch of ChatGPT has set off a race to be a leader in what top CEOs and major investors think will be the next transformative technology, generative AI. Nvidia, which sells the graphics processing unit (GPU) components that are the backbone of the advanced computing systems required for AI, has been the biggest winner so far. However, there are several other stocks primed to be winners as well. Let's take a closer look at two of them.\nMicron Technologies (NASDAQ: MU) is a leader in memory chips. Historically, its business has been highly cyclical, fluctuating from boom times to busts as the semiconductor industry tends to be sensitive to supply gluts and demand shifts. Just a year ago, the company was operating at a wide loss as coming out of the pandemic, the slowdown in demand for PCs and tablets crushed prices for memory chips.\nHowever, Micron is now emerging as a beneficiary of the AI boom as memory chips play a key role in AI servers. As Micron management explained on a recent earnings call, AI server demand is driving growth in high-bandwidth memory, which tightened the supply for the DRAM and NAND chips that Micron specializes in.\nBecause of that trend, the company expects DRAM and NAND prices to increase through calendar 2024. It now expects record revenue and \"much-improved profitability\" in fiscal 2025.\nCEO Sanjay Mehrotra also said, \"We are in the very early innings of a multiyear growth phase driven by AI as this disruptive technology will transform every aspect of business and society.\" Micron's memory and storage components are valuable in both training and inference functions for AI algorithms, making Micron a likely winner in AI.\nIf the company can generate record revenue in fiscal 2025, it would top the $30.7 billion in revenue it made in fiscal 2022. At that level, Micron would trade at a price-to-sales ratio of around 4, which is an attractive valuation, compared to other AI stocks.\nMicron also has the potential to be highly profitable as its operating margin reached 50% in 2019. If the company's profitability surges, the stock could move a lot higher from here.\nAnother tech stock that seems well-positioned to ride the AI wave is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). The company, better known as TSMC, is the world's largest contract semiconductor foundry. It handles manufacturing for many of the world's biggest chip designers, including Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices.\nTSMC has more than a 50% market share of the third-party chip manufacturing industry, giving it tremendous market power in the semiconductor industry more broadly and in AI chips specifically. It handles approximately 90% of the third-party market of advanced chips, which AI models rely on.\nBecause of its virtual monopoly in third-party chip manufacturing, TSMC is more resilient than a company like Nvidia, which needs to maintain its competitive edge and pricing power for the stock to keep gaining. Chip manufacturing has high entry barriers, which makes it unlikely that TSMC's leadership will be challenged in the coming years.\nLike Micron, TSMC is also emerging from the earlier slump in the semiconductor industry, but its growth is picking up with the help of AI. Through the year's first two months, revenue was up 9.4% and revenue growth accelerated to 11.3%. Investors took this as a sign of AI demand picking up as it was a significant improvement from flat revenue growth in the fourth quarter.\nTSMC is also highly profitable, further proving its competitive advantages and pricing power. In the fourth quarter, it recorded an operating margin of 41.6%.\nFinally, TSMC is affordably priced, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and profits are expected to improve as AI provides a tailwind. The chip manufacturing giant was already a rock-solid business, but its economic moat seems poised to widen in the AI era.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Chipmaker and AI prodigy Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues its unstoppable upward journey, having more than tripled in value in 2023 and up about 78% year-to-date. The recent Q4 beat was spectacular and drove NVDA to its all-time highs. Being at the helm of the AI revolution, my bullish stance on NVDA remains. I am confident in its long-term potential for growth, driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and its relatively favorable valuation. Hence, I will buy the stock at current levels.\nNow the third largest company in the world, Nvidia posted yet another blowout Q4 result on February 21, driven by accelerated computing and generative AI momentum. Adjusted earnings of $5.16 per share\u00a0handily beat the analysts\u2019 estimates of $4.59 per share. Also, the figure came in much higher (+486%) than the Fiscal Q4-2023 (ended January 2023) figure of $0.88 per share.\nImpressively, Q4 revenue jumped 265% year-over-year to $22.1 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $20.5 billion. On top of that, its adjusted gross margin expanded 10.6 percentage points to 76.7% from 66.1% a year ago.\nImportantly, NVDA\u2019s crown-jewel segment, Data Center revenues, more than trebled year-over-year to $47.5 billion in Fiscal 2024. Q4 revenues for the segment also saw remarkable growth, increasing by 409% year-over-year to $18.4 billion.\nAs expected, revenues declined in China due to the U.S. export control restrictions. During the earnings call, management affirmed that China represented only a mid-single-digit percentage of Data Center revenue in Q4 versus 20-25% on an average basis over the last few quarters.\nLooking ahead, the Q1 guidance appears promising, with revenues expected to hover around $24 billion. Adjusted gross margins are forecasted to be around 77%.\nExuberating great optimism for the future, CEO Jensen Huang commented during the call, \u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of two industry-wide transitions and both of them are industry-wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing\u2026 [and] a second industry-wide transition called generative AI.\u201d\nNVDA is Wall Street\u2019s favorite for a good reason. Over the last six years, Nvidia\u2019s revenues have skyrocketed by nearly 9x, from $6.91 billion in FY2017 to $60.9 billion in FY2024 (see below). What\u2019s even more applaudable is that its earnings have grown by 18x from $1.67 billion to $29.8 billion over the same period, thanks to its rising profit margins. This data instills in me a profound sense of confidence in NVDA\u2019s strong business fundamentals and its anticipated growth trajectory, driven by AI.\nAccording to Wall Street estimates, NVDA is projected to achieve a net profit of $64.3 billion in Fiscal 2025, doubling from the $32.3 billion reported in the recently concluded Fiscal 2024. Furthermore, revenues are expected to surpass the monumental $100 billion milestone. These remarkable growth expectations provide compelling reasons to continue investing in this AI giant, especially considering that the growth narrative of disruptive generative AI is only just beginning.\nInching closer to the $1,000 milestone price mark, many Wall Street analysts opine that a stock split could occur in the next year or so. NVDA underwent a 4:1 stock split in May 2021, when it was priced at approximately $600. This move facilitated easier access for smaller retail investors to purchase the stock. While a stock split doesn\u2019t inherently alter the company\u2019s valuation or fundamentals, it does broaden its investor base by attracting smaller investors.\nOther prominent companies that have opted for stock splits include EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) (in 2020 and 2022) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Therefore, it is likely that NVDA may consider another stock split in the near future.\nHaving overtaken Amazon by market capitalization and on the verge of eclipsing Apple\u2019s market cap, many investors are hesitant to purchase NVDA stock amid its remarkable rally and concerns about overvaluation.\nOn the contrary, however, NVDA stock is not expensive at all. Currently, it\u2019s trading at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 36.9x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is relatively cheaper than the multiples of its peer group. For instance, U.S.-based semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is trading at a forward P/E of 53.4x.\nFurthermore, its current valuation reflects a discount from its five-year average of 46x. These are attractive discount levels and likely present a great buying opportunity, given the supernormal growth potential for the AI market titan NVDA.\nNVDA stands as an invincible force, a stock that garners widespread attention. With 39 Buys and two Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus rating is unmistakably a Strong Buy. Nonetheless, the average Nvidia stock target price of $909.49 suggests that the shares will return 3.4% over the next year.\nInterestingly, the average target price has been increasing incredibly as analysts strive to match NVDA\u2019s continuous record-breaking highs month after month. It has increased from $661 just three months ago to $909.\nNVDA stock is poised to soar to unprecedented heights, propelled by the extraordinary growth expectations within the AI space. As an industry frontrunner, NVDA maintains a substantial lead over its competitors, boasting an almost monopolistic position with an approximately 80% market share in AI chips. This dominant position ensures a robust moat and solidifies its grip on the flourishing AI landscape.\nThe insatiable demand for all things AI far outpaces the available supply, underscoring the potential for accelerated computing and generative AI adoption across various industries and regions. This trend is anticipated to be a primary driver of revenue and earnings growth for NVDA in the years ahead.\nWith NVDA\u2019s highly anticipated live GTC conference scheduled for March 18-21, my bullish outlook on the company remains steadfast, prompting me to purchase shares at their current levels.\nDisclosure\n"

In March, she wrote:\nWithout an explosion in software revenue to justify the overbuilding of GPU capacity, we would not be surprised to see a pause in spending, compounding a correction in excess inventories, particularly among the cloud customers that account for more than half of Nvidia's data center sales.\nThat does not necessarily mean Nvidia is a bad investment. The company has navigated supply gluts in the past, and the stock has always rebounded. But Ark Invest sees better opportunities elsewhere. So Wood and her team continued to sell shares of Nvidia throughout March, while redeploying capital in The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), another company that stands to benefit from artificial intelligence.\nHere's what investors should know about the ad tech company.\nThe Trade Desk operates the largest independent, demand-side platform, a type of ad tech software that helps media buyers plan, measure, and optimize data-driven campaigns across digital channels. Its platform features what management sees as industry-leading artificial intelligence (AI) and measurement capabilities, both of which help media buyers realize greater returns on ad spending.\nThe Trade Desk has a particularly strong presence in connected TV (CTV) and retail media, two of the fastest-growing advertising channels. In fact, Forrester Research recently said The Trade Desk dominates the CTV advertising space, and Morgan Stanley believes the company will \"ultimately be a leader in offsite retail-media advertising\" due to its independent business model and growing list of retail partners.\nTo elaborate, the term independent means The Trade Desk is not affiliated with any websites or mobile apps, so it has no reason to steer advertisers toward specific inventory. By comparison, Alphabet's Google has constructed an advertising ecosystem rife with conflicts of interest. It sells ad tech software to third-party media buyers and publishers, while simultaneously selling its own inventory from properties like Google Search and YouTube.\nThat means Google has a clear incentive to direct ad buyers toward specific inventory, and the company also competes against its own customers. The upshot of those conflicts is that brands are more willing to share data with an independent player like The Trade Desk. The company has used that advantage to embed its platform with robust AI and measurement capabilities.\nSpecifically, The Trade Desk sources data from numerous leading retailers to create measurement opportunities not available on other platforms. Its lineup of partners includes Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Target, Walgreens, and Albertsons, all of which rank among the ten largest retailers in the world. The unique data sourced from those retailers also lays the foundation for superior AI, simply because data is a limiting factor in training machine learning models.\nThe Trade Desk reported strong results in the fourth quarter. Customer retention remained over 95% for the tenth consecutive year, revenue rose 23% to $606 million, and net income according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) increased 36% to $0.19 per diluted share. CEO Jeff Green told analysts, \"We outperformed the rest of the digital advertising space for the last eight quarters.\" He also said the company was uniquely positioned to continue gaining share not just in 2024, but also well into the future.\nThe Trade Desk launched a new platform called Kokai last June. It features a more advanced AI engine that synthesizes signals across 13 million impressions per second to help advertisers buy the right impression to reach the right audience at the right time. Kokai also incorporates new measurement capabilities that let advertisers assess retail-campaign performance and CTV ad quality.\nUltimately, Kokai should reduce friction and improve campaign outcomes for advertisers. That value proposition should bring more media buyers to The Trade Desk and help the company capture a greater portion of advertising budgets.\nDigital ad spending is forecasted to increase at 15.5% annually through 2030, but The Trade Desk should grow more quickly given its strong presence in the quickly expanding CTV and retail-media channels. The company also believes it can accelerate growth in international markets. That is noteworthy because North America currently accounts for 88% of ad spending on the platform.\nWith that in mind, Wall Street analysts expect The Trade Desk to grow sales at 20% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 22.4 times sales seem tolerable, though certainly not cheap. Investors should expect volatility in the near term, but The Trade Desk could create significant shareholder value in the long run. Now is a good time to buy a small position in this growth stock.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. gained its most in more than six months after Nikkei Asia reported Nvidia Corp. is looking to buy its high-bandwidth memory chips, marking a milestone for Korea\u2019s largest company.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Facing Moment of Truth for Finances in Manhattan Court\nBoeing CEO to Step Down in Overhaul Sparked by Safety Crisis\nMoscow Attack Suspects Paraded in Court as Two Plead Guilty\nUS Homebuyers Expecting $10,000 Savings Face Tough Reality\nThe report shored up investor hopes that Samsung \u2014 long the dominant player in global memory semiconductors \u2014 will close the gap with smaller rival SK Hynix Inc. in the critical field of AI. On Wednesday, executives told shareholders at their annual meeting Samsung aims to be first in the global chip market within two to three years, including by investing in capacity for high-bandwidth memory, or HBM. This type of semiconductor is best suited to work with the AI accelerators that Nvidia specializes in. Samsung\u2019s chip business should recover to 2022 levels this year, as a longstanding market slump begins to end, executives said.\nAlready the undisputed leader in AI semiconductors, Nvidia this week unveiled the next generation of its hardware, called Blackwell. Samsung\u2019s shares surged as much as 6% in Seoul after Nvidia founder Jensen Huang told reporters his company planned to also use it as an HBM supplier, according to the newspaper. \u201cI value our partnership with SK Hynix and Samsung very incredibly,\u201d it quoted Huang as saying.\nHuang\u2019s endorsement of various partners this week has boosted shares in the likes of Synopsys Inc. Hynix\u2019s own head-start in HBM \u2014 which is ideally designed to make the most of Nvidia\u2019s chips \u2014 had helped its shares double in value since the start of 2023, far outstripping Samsung\u2019s roughly 39% gain.\n\u201cWe see a very high possibility that Samsung will qualify for supplying HBM3E to Nvidia\u2019s latest chips,\u201d said Sanjeev Rana, head of Korea Research at CLSA. \u201cThe demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs is very strong, but given the limited HBM capacity at Hynix and Micron, it is very likely that Nvidia will need to rely on another supplier to meet the strong demand for its chips.\u201d\nRead More: Nvidia CEO Becomes Kingmaker by Name-Dropping Stocks\nHBM is a key part of Samsung\u2019s effort to be the world\u2019s leading chipmaker, as the one part of the memory market where Samsung doesn\u2019t enjoy a clear lead over its competition. The company said its HBM sales rose by more than 40% in the December quarter, and that memory demand showed signs of recovery.\nBut Hynix is also investing in capacity and technology to safeguard its advantage. Among other things, it\u2019s placing a bet on advanced chip packaging that it thinks will grant it a crucial edge. Samsung is pushing its own advanced packaging business after setting up a dedicated team last year, said Kyung Kye-Hyun, who heads the semiconductor business.\nRead More: SK Hynix Invests $1 Billion in Key AI Memory Chip Technology\nBeyond memory, the Suwon-based firm is working to expand its foundry business \u2014 fabricating logic chips to the design specification of outside customers, such as Nvidia \u2014 and take a larger share of the market now dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\n--With assistance from Shinhye Kang and Vlad Savov.\n(Updates with market context from the second paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds\nMagnificent Seven?

        "Title": "Nvidia's Blackwell Chip Is Here. How Will the Red-Hot \"Magnificent Seven\" Company's New GPU Affect the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Landscape?",
        "Author": "  Keith Noonan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) recent GPU Technology Conference (GTC) took the wraps off Blackwell -- the company's next-generation chip platform. Named after mathematician, statistician, and pioneering game theorist David Blackwell, the new graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware is designed to deliver unprecedented processing power for generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\nMade possible by a roughly $10 billion research and development budget, the first GB200 Blackwell processors are expected to deliver a major leap forward compared to the company's existing Hopper H100 GPUs. Nvidia expects to begin shipping the first generation of Blackwell chips later this year. A single GB200 GPU is expected to sell for somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000, and CEO Jensen Huang believes the new processor will quickly become the most successful product in the company's history.\nWhat does the upcoming release of Blackwell mean for Nvidia's stock? And how will this incredibly powerful new GPU reshape the AI landscape?\nWith a market capitalization of roughly $2.4 trillion, Nvidia now ranks as the third-most valuable of the Magnificent Seven companies. The AI leader's stock soared 259% over the last year as skyrocketing demand for its GPUs powered incredible sales and earnings growth. Now, the company has a new processor on the horizon that looks poised to deliver incredible tech breakthroughs.\nNvidia's GB200 is expected to be roughly four times as fast as its H100 GPUs, which are currently top of the line and favored for powering today's most advanced AI applications. Given the dramatic performance improvements delivered by the first generation of Blackwell chips, it's reasonable to expect that these new processors will pave the way for dramatic new advancements in AI technologies.\nNvidia already said that Blackwell is being adopted by every major global cloud-services provider. It's also seeing strong demand from AI-focused companies, telecom providers, and a range of other technology businesses. Heralding the arrival of what looks to be another breakthrough moment for artificial intelligence, Blackwell's unveiling was paired with endorsements from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and other high-profile tech leaders and luminaries.\nBut crucially, Blackwell is part of a much larger ecosystem strategy. Check out this quote from Nvidia's Jensen Huang:\nBlackwell is both a chip at the heart of the system, but it's really a platform. It's basically a computer system. What Nvidia does for a living is not build the chip. We build an entire supercomputer, from the chip to the system to the interconnects, the NVLinks, the networking, but very importantly the software.\nNvidia will also be using its next-generation GPUs to advance its position and ambitions in the software space. Leading AI developers already rely on Nvidia's CUDA software to create applications that are powered by the company's processors, and the appeal of the high-performance Blackwell processors should help ensure that customers continue to use its software.\nThe strategy extends even further. During a meeting at GTC, Huang had this to say: \"You can build chips to make software run better, but you can't create a new market without software. What makes us unique is that we're the only chip company I believe that will create its own market.\"\nWith the release of the GB200, Nvidia appears to be on track to open the door for the creation of new categories of AI software applications. In turn, the launch, scaling, and continued evolution of such software could create even more demand for its ultrahigh-end GPUs.\nReuters reported on March 25 that companies including Alphabet, Qualcomm, and Intel are teaming up to create an organization aimed at stopping Nvidia from establishing an unassailably dominant position in AI. The group's UXL Foundation is aiming to create a software suite that will help run AI applications on a wider range of processors and reduce reliance on Nvidia's platforms.\nAccording to the report, the UXL Foundation is now looking to recruit Microsoft, Amazon, and other influential technology players. So while many of the biggest names in tech are excited about Blackwell's capabilities, there's understandably resistance to the broader AI space becoming overly reliant on Nvidia's ecosystem.\nTo some extent, the formation of the UXL Foundation speaks to just how strong Nvidia's competitive positioning is right now. The company commands roughly 90% of the market for the kinds of GPUs used for AI and other accelerated computing applications, and the launch of Blackwell will likely help it maintain or even expand its dominance. Paired with an expanding array of purpose-tailored software tools, Nvidia is on track to reshape the AI landscape -- and its competitors and potential rivals have a lot of catching up to do.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAs of 2024-03-04, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $379.69. It's currently trading at a price of $822.94. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -116.74%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$12.15\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.2%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 41.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n591.55\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n1000.21\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n379.69\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $338.47. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -143.14%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Eleanor Pringle ",
        "Text": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia boss Jensen Huang have given the tech world the crossover no one knew they needed, complete with wardrobe swaps and gushing compliments.\nBut their collaboration goes deeper than an Instagram shot\u2014their relationship is a pillar holding up the S&P 500.\nFacebook founder Zuckerberg posted a photo with chip titan Huang captioned \"Jersey swap\" on Instagram\u2014a social media app he also owns.\nThe photo showed Zuckerberg wearing Huang's signature black leather jacket, while Huang donned Zuckerberg's brown-and-cream shearling coat.\nWith Zuckerberg's net wealth of $175 billion and Huang's $79.5 billion, the post quickly caught the imagination of followers and gained more than 151,000 likes within 24 hours of posting.\nWhile fans flooded to comment on the pair's outfits, the fanboying didn't stop there.\nReplying to one fan who was unfamiliar with Huang's identity, dad of three Zuckerberg replied: \"He's like Taylor Swift, but for tech.\"\nSwift has dominated the news over the past year courtesy of her Eras Tour, which saw the \"Love Story\" singer become a billionaire while generating so much economic activity that Wall Street began penning notes on her activity.\nHuang has had a similarly stratospheric start to 2024.\nSo far the chipmaker's stock is up nearly 90% for the year to date with Wall Street remaining generally bullish on the continuing outlook.\nZuckerberg also hinted this won't be the last unexpected fashion interaction between the pair.\nReplying to another comment, Harvard dropout Zuckerberg said: \"I did get Jensen a black shearling coat for his collection that I'll give to him next time I see him.\"\nThe comment section on Zuck's Instagram page also gave a tongue-in-cheek insight into what the pair might have discussed.\nOne user questioned whether the meet was about Meta buying H100 chips\u2014which Zuckerberg said in January he was stockpiling to a level of 340,000 by the end of the year.\nBut Zuckerberg responded: \"Planning for those B100s.\"\nNvidia's Blackwell B100 is an AI chip already being used by Amazon Web Services.\nThe relationship between Meta and Nvidia is mutually beneficial.\nFor starters, Meta is widely reported to be one of Nvidia's biggest customers.\nIn January, Zuckerberg indicated he was spending billions of dollars a year on H100 chips, saying his company was building a \u201cmassive compute infrastructure.\u201d\nIn an Instagram reels post, he added that this will include 350,000 of the Nvidia graphics cards.\nOn eBay, these chips sell for anywhere up to $48,000, while analysts told CNBC they expect the business is directly selling at $25,000 to $30,000.\nHuang has also been outspoken about Meta's input into the AI race.\nSpeaking at the World Governments Summit in Dubai earlier this year, Huang said: \"Let's face it, the single most important thing that has happened last year\u2014if you were to ask me\u2014the one, single, most important event last year and how it has activated AI researchers here in this region is actually Llama 2.\"\nLlama 2 is Meta's open-source large-language model, which is available for free for both research and commercial use.\nAnd while Huang has signposted Meta's contribution to the sector, Zuckerberg's confidence in a supply of chips\u2014a concern for many tech businesses\u2014will also allow him to deliver on the AI promises that have boosted Wall Street's confidence in the business.\nZuckerberg's wealth has soared since he took a step back from his metaverse dream to focus on AI technology.\nFor Meta\u2019s largest individual shareholder, a combination of a 2023 \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d and making AI the company\u2019s priority resulted in a near $40 billion boost last year.\nIndeed, in February the term \u201cAI\u201d was used more than 80 times by Meta staffers on the company's earnings call\u2014a move that has proved something of a surefire way to pique the interest of investors.\nCourtesy of the positive picture\u00a0Zuckerberg\u00a0and his team had for analysts\u2014and the clear show of focus on the emerging technology\u2014Meta\u2019s share price shot up 20% in the hours following the announcement.\nThe support between the pair comes at the very top of the stock market: The couple are two of the Magnificent Seven stocks, the Herculean shares that have held up the S&P 500 in recent years.\nThis smooth relationship between the two has contributed to confidence among investors and share price gains for both\u2014Meta is up 42% in the year to date\u2014meaning the multibillion-dollar bromance may go far deeper than outerwear.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Beyond Nvidia: Why Lam Research, Oracle, and Micron Technology Are Prime AI Investments in 2024",
        "Author": "  Anders Bylund, Nicholas Rossolillo, and Billy Duberstein, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "While Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) might be the poster child for the business side of artificial intelligence (AI), the true depth of this technological revolution lies in its vast ecosystem. In this arena, many players contribute to AI's expanding horizon from very different angles.\nThree seasoned Motley Fool contributors have spotted opportunities that venture beyond Nvidia's glamorous, but perhaps overpriced, AI success. They spotlight Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), a titan in semiconductor equipment, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), a cloud-computing giant pivoting to AI, and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), a key player in the indispensable memory sector. Each business is uniquely positioned to thrive in the AI era, promising robust stock returns along the way.\nIn the quest for AI dominance, there's more to the story than just one company. Let's see what savvy investors can learn from this diverse collection of AI insights and promising investment ideas.\nBilly Duberstein (Lam Research): While Nvidia dominates the AI training chipset today, will it be as dominant in the future? It's certainly possible but not assured.\nBut no matter which AI chip wins out, some things are nearly guaranteed. One is that the AI revolution will require a slew of leading-edge logic, DRAM memory, and NAND flash storage, based on emerging chipmaking technologies.\nSemiconductor capital-equipment player Lam Research makes the critical equipment that enables foundries to make all of these advanced chips, in some cases winning 100% market share of specific process steps. The processes Lam tends to dominate are in the etch and deposition of chip components in stacked or vertical structures. These verticalization steps will be increasingly crucial in new AI technologies.\nThe technologies include gate-all-around transistors in which transistors are \"stacked\" and surrounded on all sides by gate nanosheets; backside power in which chip components are etched on the back of chips to allow for greater transistor content on the front; and advanced packaging in which holes and connectors are drilled vertically through 3D-stacked chips and high-bandwidth memory. In addition, Lam management highlighted its new dry-resist technology that helps better absorb photons of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines as a major opportunity. Currently, dry resist is in lab testing at all major foundry customers.\nThese are each incremental billion-dollar opportunities, according to Lam's management. And it means no matter whether Nvidia or one of its competitors gains the most share of AI chips or memory, Lam stands to benefit due to these broader chipmaking-technology transitions.\nMoreover, Lam's prior \"core\" business in NAND flash is in its worst downturn ever. Despite that, Lam still made nearly $26 per share over the past 12 months in just about the worst environment one can imagine for the NAND investment industry.\nNot only should NAND investment recover, but investment in NAND will probably eventually exceed its prior highs, CFO Doug Bettinger said at a recent investor conference. That assertion seems likely in the context of AI growth as well. While AI will be a known boon to both leading ledge logic and DRAM chips, AI servers also require about three times the NAND flash memory as a traditional server. And if edge devices and PCs eventually run AI models on edge devices, those devices will also need more \"fast storage\" -- i.e., NAND flash -- per device, too.\nSo when one thinks about a simultaneous AI-driven tech inflection in logic and DRAM chips along with the prospect of a an eventual NAND flash recovery later this year or next year, it's pretty apparent Lam is in for some powerful earnings growth. Combined with robust free-cash-flow generation, even in a trough year last year, and a growing dividend, and Lam looks like an AI winner to hold over the long term.\nAnders Bylund (Micron Technology): Powerful AI systems require a lot of memory chips. And I mean a lot of memory chips. You know the Nvidia A100 AI accelerators that power the supercomputer OpenAI used to train ChatGPT's large language model (LLM)? That computing beast runs 3,456 computing nodes, each equipped with four A100 chips, and each one holds 64 gigabytes (GB) of DRAM memory right on the card. The nodes also hold 512 GB of shared DRAM managed by an Intel processor. That's 2.6 million gigabytes of random access memory, or 2.6 petabytes.\nBut that's not all. The Leonardo supercomputer also contains nearly 11 petabytes of flash memory in high-speed, solid-state drive (SSD) storage modules. Altogether, the ChatGPT-training supercomputer needs about 14 petabytes of high-end memory.\nThat's just one system, already belonging to an older generation of supercomputers. The next wave of LLM training platforms uses even more AI accelerators, more DRAM, and more flash-based storage. And since every tech giant worth its salt wants to take advantage of the AI boom, demand for these computing monsters runs high.\nMicron Technology sees enormous value in the AI frenzy. The central data-crunching is also supported by beefier -- and more memory-hungry -- computing systems in many places.\n\"Generative AI use cases are expanding from the data center to the edge with several recent announcements of AI-enabled PCs, smartphones with on-device AI capabilities as well as embedded AI in the auto and industrial end markets,\" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in December's first-quarter 2024 earnings call. \"From the data center to the edge, AI has emerged as a significant secular driver that will further bolster the industry toward record revenue [total addressable market] in 2025 and drive growth for years to come.\"\nAI computing will be a serious growth driver for Micron in the next few years. Unit prices are also on the rebound after a couple of weak years -- a common pattern in the highly cyclical memory-chip market. And amid these bullish signs, Micron shares trade at the affordable valuation ratios of 6 times sales and 13.5 times forward-earnings estimates. This leading provider of world-class memory chips is poised to soar as the AI mania plays out, and the stock is a bargain-bin find next to Nvidia's lofty valuation ratios.\nNicholas Rossolillo (Oracle): In the autumn of 2022, in the midst of the bear market and before all the Nvidia AI frenzy got rolling, an old and forgotten software company called Oracle quietly struck a deal with Nvidia.\nYou see, Oracle was still in the early stages of building its cloud-computing infrastructure service in which it rents out the use of data-center computing to customers, which can access those services on demand via an internet connection. In a bid to catch up to the cloud-infrastructure giants Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud inked a deal to be the first to purchase and install Nvidia's AI-accelerated computing servers.\nThe rest, as they say, is history. Nvidia stock has gone off like a rocket since then.\nBut in all reality, the old software giant of yesteryear, Oracle, hasn't done so badly either. It's been putting up its best growth rates in years thanks to its head start plugging Nvidia chips and hardware into its cloud. The last quarter (which just ended in February 2024) was another case in point. Revenue increased 7% year over year, but resulting earnings per share jumped 16% year over year. Talk about positive operating leverage. A little additional revenue is almost entirely trickling down to the bottom-line profit for Oracle right now.\nOracle's cloud-infrastructure segment (versus the slower-growing and larger software segments) is responsible for much of this expansion, increasing 49% year over year to $1.8 billion in sales. For investors feeling like they missed the boat on Nvidia stock, Oracle offers a way to access Nvidia's success via proxy -- and a relative value at that. Oracle shares are currently valued at just 22 times expected current fiscal-year earnings (Oracle's current fiscal year wraps up in May) and 20 times next fiscal year's expected earnings. If you like what Nvidia is cooking up but are worried about valuation, give Oracle a serious look.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Micron Technology wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "The Fly ",
        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\u00a0Top 5 Upgrades: \nDeutsche Bank upgraded Target (TGT) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $206, up from $149, post the Q4 report. The company's initial 2024 guidance appears reasonable, while leaving room for upside, the firm tells investors in a research note. HSBC also upgraded Target to Buy from Hold with a price target of $195, up from $140.\nBerenberg upgraded Honeywell (HON) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $240, up from $195. In the context of the stock's current valuation, the firm sees Honeywell's growth algorithm as attractive.\nWolfe Research upgraded GitLab (GTLB) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $75 price target. Following GitLab's print, which sent shares down 21%, the firm sees a \"story of potentially being one of the fastest growers in software this year with multiple product catalysts and significant upside from pricing.\"\nMorgan Stanley upgraded Progressive (PGR) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $227, up from $185. Progressive's \"strong culture\" of technology innovation, favorable competitive environment, and gradual business mix shift should give it the ability to outgrow the market, the firm argues.\nLeerink upgraded Regenxbio (RGNX) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $37, up from $24. With the Phase 1/2 AFFINITY DUCHENNE update, RGX-202 has accumulated enough data to suggest a path to a differentiated role in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, the firm says.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nBerenberg downgraded Rockwell Automation (ROK) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $290, down from $330. Following a \"soft\" Q1, there is an unusually high second half bias to the company's earnings this year, implying near-term earnings risk is more skewed to the downside, the firm says.\nCLSA downgraded Nio (NIO) to Outperform from Buy with a price target of $6, down from $9.80. The firm says that while Nio has made steady progress on the construction of its battery swapping network, it sees slower growth, driving reduced estimates.\nRBC Capital downgraded ChargePoint (CHPT) to Sector Perform from Outperform with a price target of $3, down from $3.50. While the company's fiscal Q2 results slightly beat expectations, the Q1 guidance shows continued revenue pressure as a result of sluggish macro demand, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nCanaccord downgraded TTEC Holdings (TTEC) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $13, down from $30. The firm says the macro environment remains tough and TTEC's clients remain reticent about committing to service volume levels more than a month or two out.\nBofA downgraded Old Dominion (ODFL) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $446, up from $443. The firm sees limited upside given the stock's elevated multiple and the fact that volume growth has lagged BofA's forecast, the firm says.\nTop 5 Initiations: \nCICC initiated coverage of Nvidia (NVDA) with an Outperform rating and $870 price target. Nvidia is reaping benefits from its increasing cloud capex and the short supply of computing power for the training of large language models, or LLMs, in the market and the firm expects it to maintain its leading position in AI computing on technological strengths and ecosystem advantages.\nEvercore ISI initiated coverage of Casey's General Stores (CASY) with an Outperform rating and $345 price target. Casey's is well positioned to leverage its scale advantage and consolidate a \"large and fragmented\" convenient store market, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nArgus initiated coverage of Supermicro (SMCI) with a Buy rating and $1,350 price target. The firm is positive on the company's position as a leading computer and server provider for the age of generative AI, also noting that it provides GPU-based systems for deep learning, high performance computing, and other applications.\nNeedham initiated coverage of Pure Storage (PSTG) with a Buy rating and $66 price target. Pure Storage has persistently gained market share from competitors with its \"differentiated\" direct-to-flash storage offering, the firm notes.\nCraig-Hallum initiated coverage of WisdomTree (WT) with a Buy rating and $12 price target. The firm believes significant growth potential in managed models remains and says the company's first-mover advantage in blockchain \"presents a practical, outsized risk/reward.\"\n"

        "Title": "NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) high institutional ownership speaks for itself as stock continues to impress, up 14% over last week",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Significantly high institutional ownership implies NVIDIA's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 45% ownership\n Insiders have sold recently \nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 68% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nAnd last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$2.1t in market cap. One-year return to shareholders is currently 267% and last week\u2019s gain was the icing on the cake.\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of NVIDIA, beginning with the chart below.\n View our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nWe can see that NVIDIA does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of NVIDIA, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NVIDIA. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.3% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.3% of common stock, and FMR LLC holds about 4.9% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO has 3.5% of the shares allocated to their name.\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nWe can see that insiders own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. Insiders own US$84b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. \nWith a 28% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NVIDIA. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  NVIDIA is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

        "Text": "There's little question that artificial intelligence (AI) has been on a hot streak over the past year or so, and that trend shows little signs of slowing.\nIt isn't just average investors that are bullish on these developments. Billionaires, venture capital firms, and some of the world's biggest tech companies have AI fever -- and one start-up in particular is attracting a lot of attention.\nFigure AI is working on a humanoid robot -- dubbed Figure 01 -- that has attracted a lot of attention. It was founded by serial entrepreneur Brett Adcock, who also founded Archer Aviation -- an aerospace company working on an all-electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.\nIn its most recent funding round, the start-up attracted financing from billionaire Jeff Bezos and Ark Investment Management's Cathie Wood, as well as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and AI wunderkind OpenAI -- the start-up that arguably kicked off the AI revolution. Figure AI raised roughly $675 million, which valued the start-up at roughly $2.6 billion.\nFigure AI developed an autonomous robot that can help alleviate labor shortages in warehouses, transportation, and retail. Just last week, Figure released a video to demonstrate its progress. It says these fields have 7 million unfilled jobs and not enough workers to fill them. Figure recently announced its first commercial agreement to supply BMW with general-purpose robots for automotive production.\nIt might be difficult for investors to invest directly in Figure AI, as the start-up is privately held, but they can invest indirectly. For example, Microsoft is among the largest investors at $95 million, so buying shares of Microsoft will get you indirect exposure to Figure AI, though a very small amount.\nHowever, there are plenty of other reasons to buy Microsoft to take part in the AI revolution.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Title": "Up 80% Since 2023, Is This Stock Ready to Repeat Nvidia's Record Performance?",
        "Author": "  Nick Rossolillo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Leading semiconductor design software company Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS) is having a moment. Over the last three years, the company has shot out of relative obscurity and into the limelight -- and for good reason.\nAs per new CEO Sassine Ghazi, Synopsys has \"delivered a 17% revenue CAGR [compound average growth rate], non-GAAP [generally accepted accounting principles] operating margin improvement of 7 points, and non-GAAP EPS [earnings per share] growth at a 26% CAGR.\" For a large software company, it's been a stellar run higher, especially considering that includes a bear market.\nBut is that financial performance good enough to justify an 80% run since the start of 2023? Perhaps.\nA more important question, though, is what will happen going forward -- because while Nvidia gets most of the attention for the current AI hype, Synopsys plays a huge role as well. Can Synopsys go parabolic like Nvidia stock has?\nSynopsys' most recent quarterly earnings were very good. Revenue increased 21% year over year to $1.65 billion, and adjusted EPS increased 36% year over year. Management increased its full-year expectation for adjusted EPS, now anticipated to increase 21% from 2023.\nThe item that has captivated everyone's attention, though, is the pending merger between Synopsys and design simulation software provider Ansys (NASDAQ: ANSS). Officially announced in late January, this deal isn't likely to be finalized until sometime in 2025, pending regulatory approval.\nNevertheless, there are big moves happening in this market. Synopsys is trying to acquire Ansys as ridiculously complex AI systems are ratcheting up challenges for customers -- from data center operators to auto manufacturers to smartphone developers. Synopsys' peer Cadence Design Systems\u00a0recently announced its own AI-powered supercomputing platform to boost customers' simulation capabilities in the design workflow. And Keysight Technologies also quietly made a small acquisition to increase its own capabilities in the same department.\nWhat's the big deal with simulation software anyway? Ghazi commented on the earnings call:\nThere is no one more capable of helping companies innovate for this era of pervasive intelligence. Semiconductor companies are now designing with a system approach in mind, while system companies are unlocking additional value through purpose-built chips and software-defined systems. At the same time, customers see the fusion of electronics design and physics simulation as critical to delivering high-performing and high-yielding solutions for their business.\nSynopsys-plus-Ansys unlocks new market opportunities for the merged business, especially as the growing pervasiveness of AI makes design work more complex. Ansys already makes the bulk of its revenue from non-tech customers in industrial markets, so Synopsys could get its own design software into the hands of companies that need help with AI the most. If successful, this could help blur the lines between computing intelligence of today and the (currently) very different world of mechanical engineering.\nBut why compare Synopsys-plus-Ansys to Nvidia, though? Back in 2019, I wrote extensively about an underrated pending acquisition the AI titan was trying to make: network chip design company Mellanox. When Nvidia finally closed the deal in early 2020, the pandemic had struck, and few investors were paying attention to the new AI training potential Nvidia was sitting on.\nHowever, Mellanox ended up being an absolutely critical piece of Nvidia's current AI dominance, as it helped the company solve some problems with quickly moving massive amounts of data during the AI training process.\nCould Synopsys be trying to solve for a similar AI pain point (making AI usable in everyday applications for the masses) by purchasing Ansys? Maybe it is, and big profitable gains lay ahead in the coming years.\nAll of this may sound good, but there's the problem of valuation. Synopsys stock fetches a high premium of 63 times trailing-12-month EPS, and 67 times trailing-12-month free cash flow (which more closely aligns with adjusted EPS). On a forward-looking basis, Synopsys trades for about 42 times expected EPS -- still a high price tag to be sure.\nNvidia also trades for a similarly hefty valuation, and has for many years. It would seem that top AI stocks are destined to be \"expensive.\" New AI is still in the early stages of development, after all, and have the potential to unlock massive new efficiencies in business operations.\nMind this premium, but don't ignore Synopsys stock either. With or without Ansys, it sits at a critical point in the semiconductor industry, and in AI development at large. Acquiring Ansys could go down in history as a huge deal. Consider utilizing a dollar-cost averaging plan to build a position in Synopsys over time to smooth out the inevitable volatility in stock price.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Synopsys right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Synopsys, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Synopsys wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "How much are Nvidia's rivals investing in startups? We investigated",
        "Author": "  Kyle Wiggers ",
        "Text": "Over the past couple of years, Nvidia, by far the largest AI chipmaker, has ramped up its investments in startups that propel it deeper into the AI space. According to S&P Global and Crunchbase, the funding and investment database, Nvidia's startup investments jumped 280% year-over-year from 2022 to 2023, with the company and its VC arm, Nvidia Ventures, participating in ~46 deals last year.\nIt's not the only one. Nvidia's chief rivals in the AI chip space -- AMD, Arm and Intel -- have been investing aggressively in startups, too, looking to make up ground in markets inclusive of the especially frothy generative AI segment.\nWe at TechCrunch were curious to see how the investments stacked up between the top AI chipmakers -- Nvidia, AMD, Arm and Intel. So we pored over Crunchbase data, with an eye toward recent activity from each chipmaker and their VC divisions.\nOf Nvidia's competitors, Intel far and away has the biggest startup investment operation thanks to Intel Capital, its long-running VC. In 2023, Intel Capital deployed over $350 million across its investments, including OpenAI rival AI21 Labs, identity risk management platform Grip Security, app delivery network Fly.io and workplace safety outfit TuMeke.\nCrunchbase data isn't exhaustive. But it shows that Intel Capital participated in 32 startup deals in 2023, down from 47 in 2022. Intel also directly invested in two startups last year (Hugging Face and Twelve Labs), per Crunchbase, plus made a \"non-equity\" investment in payment infrastructure startup Tweed (via Intel's Ignite accelerator) -- bringing its grand total deal count to 34 in 2023 and 47 in 2022.\nCrunchbase lists Intel as having invested in Vanguard SemiConductor and Aleph Alpha, but a spokesperson tells TechCrunch that's incorrect, so we've excluded them from the count.\nCuriously, AI startups -- despite their strategic importance to the chip industry these days -- make up a relatively small portion of Intel's venture portfolio. According to Crunchbase, Intel's holdings in software, IT and enterprise SaaS companies far outnumber its AI startup holdings by deal volume.\nThat could change as Intel seeks to deliver new software products and services, including GenAI-powered products, that make its hardware more attractive for a range of AI applications. Just in January, Intel spun out a company, Articul8 AI, to build GenAI solutions running on Intel chips for enterprises in the aerospace, financial services, telecommunications and semiconductor industries.\nArm might not be a particularly active startup investor compared to Intel. But the company, which makes most of its money licensing chipsets it designs to customers, has several direct investment deals as well as deals through Deeptech Labs, a VC fund and accelerator that Arm co-launched with the University of Cambridge, Cambridge Innovation Capital and Martlet Capital.\nLast year, Arm made four direct investments in startups -- microprocessor venture SiPearl, eSIM security company Kigen and Raspberry Pi and the Raspberry Pi Foundation -- and six investments through Deeptech Labs. Beneficiaries of the Deeptech Labs cash included Nu Quantum, a quantum networking startup; RoboK, which is building 3D sensing tech; and Perceptual Robotics, a provider of automated wind turbine inspection tech.\nAltogether, then, Arm poured money into 10 startups in 2023. That's a significant uptick from 2022, when Arm invested in just four companies -- a direct investment in the open source hardware startup Arduino and three investments through Deeptech Labs (Waku Robotics, Xapien and SonicEdge).\nOne presumes Arm's future investments will rope in AI in a more obvious way, given that the company's betting on sales of both its data center and consumer AI chips to steeply increase this year.\nAMD has a VC org of its own, AMD Ventures, through which it invests in startups. But for AMD, the deals come relatively few and far between.\nLast year, AMD Ventures made a handful of investments, participating in the Series A for Ethernovia, a startup building a family of ethernet chips and software, and investing in rounds for Essential AI, which looks to pioneer AI-powered software automation tech; Moreh, a company creating tools to optimize AI models; and Hugging Face (alongside Intel and Nvidia). The year before, AMD inked a single deal with Radian Arc, an infrastructure-as-a-service platform for cloud gaming and AI -- and made no other investments.\nAMD's deal total in 2023 came to four -- on the conservative side compared to rivals. But 2024 may look a bit different. Contacted for comment, AMD had this to share from Matthew Hein, the company's chief strategy officer of corporate development:\nAMD Ventures has ramped up its investment activity in the past year and is looking to accelerate further in 2024, targeting reaching a double-digit investment level. We invest across stages, supporting promising early startups poised to become market leaders, as well as mature later stage companies. Most of our new investments in 2024 will be targeting the AI ecosystem, including AI platforms, generative model companies and AI infrastructure offerings.\n2024 will be a pivotal year for AMD in other respects. The company's ramping up production of its MI300 AI chip, which is designed to handle AI workloads in data centers, and launching Ryzen 8040, its mobile AI-accelerated processors bound for laptops.\nSo it's true: Nvidia isn't the only chipmaker investing in early ventures. But it does appear to be outgunning the competition. In the first three quarters of 2023 alone, Nvidia funneled nearly a billion dollars to \"non-affiliated\" firms, per the earlier S&P Global report -- a figure even Intel Capital struggled to match.\nSuccess in the AI chipmaking space needn't entail fostering a robust startup ecosystem. But it's clear that Nvidia, one of the world's most valuable companies with control of about 95% of the market for AI chips, is playing for keeps -- attempting to shore up dominance by spreading its financial influence far and wide.\nI'd say its rivals have their work cut out for them.\n"

        "Title": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could Be the Next Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Finding the next great stock, like an Amazon or, more recently, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), is the dream -- one stock that can generate portfolio- and life-changing returns, sometimes very quickly. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has given investors its best Nvidia impression. The stock is up a whopping 750% over the past year.\nNow, a stock rarely goes up that much, that quickly. That's why it might seem wild that I'm predicting it will continue. Of course, success may not be a straight line. Still, I believe Supermicro, as it is better known these days, could easily mimic Nvidia's epic multiyear run and soar upward over the coming years.\nThe recipe for Supermicro's success is simple. Dominant leadership in a rapidly growing industry equals outperformance. Investors are already seeing the equation play out, which helps explain the stock's remarkable success. My prediction is based on the simple theory that artificial intelligence (AI) spending will continue well into the future.\nFirst, the basics. Supermicro is a computing hardware innovator. It began with motherboards in the early 1990s but today sells turn-key modular server systems to corporations. Do you know how to build a computer from scratch? Neither do many companies. So, like most would do, they turn to an expert like Supermicro.\nSupermicro's modular system can be easily scaled to the size a company needs and can be built upon in the future if needs grow. Like Nvidia's AI chips, customers are flocking to Supermicro for their AI needs:\nManagement is basing this on its internal data and industry data from Gartner. Supermicro's revenue grew 103% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Dec. 31, 2023), and guidance is for up to 218% year-over-year growth in the current quarter.\nThe million-dollar question, of course, is whether this can last. According to the people most connected to AI, it can and will. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently made headlines for his call to expand global chip capacity, claiming a need to invest trillions of dollars for the cause. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted an additional $1 trillion in data center spending over the next several years.\nIf these predictions are remotely accurate, Supermicro, which just did $3.7 billion in revenue in Q2, is poised to have more opportunities than it can shake a stick at. Ultimately, this has to play out, and an inability to support demand could send business to Supermicro's competitors. However, it's hard to see how Super Micro Computer doesn't have every opportunity to fulfill these skyrocketing expectations for long-term growth.\nGiven the abovementioned situation, it's reasonable to expect growth estimates to rise. That's happened already. Analysts are looking for earnings growth averaging 48% annually over the long term. This seems realistic for a company now growing at a triple-digit rate.\nAt a forward P/E ratio of just 40, Supermicro's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is less than 1, signaling that the stock is still a bargain for its expected future growth potential.\nThere's a fascinating psychological phenomenon called anchoring bias, in which the mind sticks to the first number it sees. In other words, investors see how much Supermicro has climbed over the past year and assume that the stock must be expensive. To be fair, most stocks are overpriced if they rise that much in a year.\nHowever, data shows that Supermicro could be the exception. Now, there are investment risks because you are projecting things in the future. Nothing is guaranteed in life. However, the data and recent financial performance indicate a bright future for Super Micro Computer and its shareholders.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Alex Sirois ",
        "Text": "It\u2019s been about a week since CEO Jensen Huang packed a who\u2019s who of the tech world into a stadium in San Jose. Huang was there to unveil the latest chips from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) code named Blackwell. Those chips are widely expected to improve on the company\u2019s already dominant h100 chips. The announcement should benefit multiple AI stocks and has given Huang\u2019s company a bit of a bounce following recent turbulence. This has led to this list of stocks to profit from Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell.\nThe chips code named Blackwell or expected to improve on Nvidia\u2019s h100 chips and pull the company even higher. In turn, that should pull the wider AI sector that the company anchors higher again.\nIn other words the introduction of the Blackwell chips should be a strong catalyst within the already surging AI sector.\u00a0 With that in mind let\u2019s look at seven stocks that should benefit from the recent conference.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\nNvidia stock should be the biggest beneficiary of the recent unveiling of the Blackwell chip.\nInvestors should anticipate that demand for those chips will be similarly strong to demand for the company\u2019s h100 chips. CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Blackwell chips will basically quadruple the efficiency of AI model training once released. Training a current AI model takes 90 days and requires 8,000 h100 GPUs and 15 megawatts of power. A similar model could be trained over the same period of time with 2000 Blackwell chips and 4 megawatts of power.\nIt\u2019s also expected that those chips could cost north of $50,000. Nvidia\u2019s h100 chips have been wildly in demand with prices rising above $40,000 per chip at times.\nNvidia has become extremely valuable because the company has invested in AI for more than a decade. that early investment has paid off and led to a commanding market lead in AI. The company isn\u2019t without competition but Nvidia controls roughly 4/5 of the AI computation market.\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a leading provider of memory chips and an important supplier of those chips to Nvidia. Its stock is currently benefiting from a strong earnings report which is one reason to buy the stock. That aside, let\u2019s look at what Micron does and how that relates to Nvidia.\nMicron Technology is an important supplier of high bandwidth memory chips that Nvidia uses to enable AI workloads on its hardware. At the end of February it was announced that Micron Technology had started mass production of those HBM memory chips to be used in Nvidia\u2019s AI semiconductors.\nNvidia is diversifying its supply chain for HBM chips. Micron Technology will be the sole link in the supply chain within the domestic market. Previously, South Korea\u2019s SK Hynix was the sole provider of the HBM chips. However, Nvidia also announced that it was testing HBM chips from Samsung \u2013 another Korean giant \u2013 at the same time.\u00a0It\u2019s one of those stocks to profit from Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell.\nMU stock has tremendous potential to grow should the company prove successful as an HBM supplier.\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) share prices fell in the wake of Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference where the Blackwell chip was announced. The company continues to attempt to chip away at Nvidia\u2019s 80% dominance over computational AI chips.\nEssentially, there wasn\u2019t any specific business related news that should have sent amd\u2019s shares lower. That\u2019s a good thing because investors should not forget that AMD is also set to introduce next generation AI chips this year.\nAMD is slated to release its updated MI300 chips later this year. Those chips will feature technology that is set to upgrade its MI300 chips. Those chips are expected to compete with the Blackwell B100 from Nvidia. AMD is expected to release MI400 chips in 2025.\nThose updated MI300 chips will include high bandwidth memory technology on par with that being used in Nvidia chips. AMD continues to challenge Nvidia especially in relation to price versus performance metrics. If Nvidia\u2019s greed ends up getting the better of the company AMD will be right there to pick up the slack. This makes it one of those stocks to profit from Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell.\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) stock recently popped after it was revealed that Nvidia has made a significant investment in the voice AI firm. It should continue to be strong in the wake of the Blackwell chip announcement by Nvidia.\nVoice AI or conversational AI is one of the next niche areas within artificial intelligence. SoundHound AI is one of the leaders in that vertical and provides services to firms from data centers to restaurants.\u00a0 However, Blackwell chips are particularly important in relation to autonomous vehicles, another strength of SoundHound AI.\nWhat\u2019s important to note here is that Nvidia\u2019s generative AI will work in concert with SoundHound AI\u2019s voice AI in an\u00a0 in vehicle voice assistant. Nvidia invested in SoundHound AI because it applies to its Nvidia Drive platform. That platform has evolved to use the upcoming Blackwell B100 chips which should open a broader runway for SoundHound AI in the process. That is the primary reason to watch its stock in the wake of the GTC conference. This makes it one of those stocks to profit from Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell.\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\nARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) stock is similar to SoundHound AI in that it was also recently revealed to be among Nvidia\u2019s small but influential portfolio of holdings.The fact that Nvidia has invested in arm stock is certainly important but there is a more important factor to consider in the wake of the Blackwell announcement.\nIt\u2019s reasonable to believe that ARM Holdings\u2019 business model just got significantly stronger. Generally speaking, arm Holdings gets paid more as the complexity of Nvidia\u2019s chips increases. That is true because Nvidia increasingly leverages IP from ARM Holdings of late. The company\u2019s advanced chip technology designs are required in many of Nvidia\u2019s most recent AI chips for various applications. That means that the price of licensing has increased dramatically of late. It\u2019s also true that more and more of those IP designs are required. The result is that ARM Holdings is booming.\nThat should only continue to increase as Nvidia releases more and more advanced chips including the Blackwell B100.\nSource: Shutterstock\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) remains closely correlated to Nvidia even after the company announced that it would offer 2 million shares of stock.\nThe company\u2019s shares failed dramatically after it announced its intention to sell 2 million additional shares of common stock in order to raise capital. While that is certainly going to raise fear of subsequent dilution moving forward, it also creates a buying opportunity.\nSuper Micro Computer helps chip firms design Server racks and storage clusters that are important in the realm of data centers. The close relationship between Super Micro Computer and Nvidia has sent shares of the latter soaring in recent months.\nThe bullish outlook on Super Micro Computer is simply that the company needs more capital to chase continued growth. The recent issuance of 2 million shares seems more innocuous when viewed in that light. In any case, the company is likely to see continued demand for its services from Nvidia as the company introduces its Blackwell B100 chips. Those chips will be in demand for data center applications and Super Micro Computer plays a vital role in designing the server racks needed therein.\nSource: Shutterstock\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has recently closened its ties with Nvidia in relation to packaging opportunities. That\u2019s one reason to believe in Intel stock following the reveal of the Blackwell chips.\nThe two companies recently announced that they will be working together to strengthen Nvidia\u2019s packaging supply chain requirements. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that the release of the Blackwell B100 chip will provide further opportunities for Intel in that regard.\nIntel has advanced packaging capacity in Oregon and New Mexico which will serve to alleviate some of Nvidia\u2019s supply chain issues especially in regard to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM).\nInvestors should also consider that Intel was recently awarded $8.5 billion dollars in U.S. subsidies In relation to the Chips act. Although the news isn\u2019t directly related to Nvidia\u2019s most recent announcement it is a positive catalyst overall period. It\u2019s clear that the United States remains highly concerned about the threat of China to its neighbors including Taiwan. That is opening new avenues of opportunity for Intel.\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Author": " Karen Friar    and Hamza Shaban    ",
        "Text": "March arrived with a bang on Wall Street as stocks set new records, fueled by a promising inflation reading and a relentless tech rally, which saw Nvidia closing with a market cap above $2 trillion for the first time.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.8%, setting a new high. The S&P 500 has risen 16 out of 18 weeks, chugging along after passing 5,000 for the first time last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2% or just under 100 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) rose 1.1%, claiming a record of its own for the second day in a row.\nStocks are kicking off March with an upbeat reaction to PCE data that showed inflation continued to cool \u2014 easing worries the Federal Reserve would get more reason to hold off from interest rate cuts. But further scrutiny has highlighted signs of \"sticky\" inflation that will be harder to shift.\nAmong big movers, Nvidia (NVDA), the tech company at the center of the AI excitement on Wall Street ended the day with a market cap exceeding $2 trillion for the first time. Meanwhile, shares in New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) tumbled 26% after the exit of its CEO, a $2.7 billion quarterly loss, and findings of \"material weaknesses\" in the bank's loan processes. Finally, Dell (DELL) shares rose 31% in the wake of a quarterly sales and profit beat fueled by AI prospects for its servers.\nDevelopments at OpenAI caught the attention of investors tracking the sector. Elon Musk has sued the Microsoft-backed (MSFT) company and its CEO Sam Altman, among others, over a breach of contract. Also, the ChatGPT maker is reportedly set to name new board members in March to end an impasse linked to Altman's abrupt firing last year.\nThe February rally never ended and now the March rally has begun.\nTwo major indexes claimed record highs Friday, fueled by the excitement around tech's AI moment.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.8%, setting a new high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2% or just under 100 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) rose 1.1%, claiming a record close for the second day in a row.\nTarget (T), Costco (COST), and Box (BOX) are among the major names to report next week, as the earnings winds down but continues to ramp up Wall Street's optimism, propelling market to new highs.\nFebruary's jobs report will inform Fed officials as they continue to weigh economic data leading up to the their next policy meeting later this month. As growth resurges and stubborn inflation pressures remain, some officials have tempered expectations that rate cuts will arrive soon. The Fed will release heir updated forecasts on March 20, alongside its next monetary policy decision, which Wall Street expects to go unchanged.\nThursday's inflation reading of the Fed's preferred measure the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4% over the prior month in January. And compared to a month ago, the market is more confident that a rate cut wont arrive until June.\nInvestors and and policymakers will also be on the lookout for the latest data on job openings and labor turnover pinned to January 2024, providing more insight into employers' staffing prospects and the confidence of job seekers.\nYahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week:\nSave your condolences for the death of the AppleCar and send your congratulations. Who needs an expensive, low-margin electric vehicle when you have ambiguous hopes for AI?\nAfter an ill-fated, decade-long odyssey, Apple has said goodbye to its car project and will redirect resources to its artificial intelligence division. A blow to all who longed to see exactly which generation Fiat 500 Jony Ive would have paid homage to.\nIf the decision was an admission of defeat \u2014 Elon Musk responded to the news on X with an emoji of a salute and a cigarette \u2014 it didn't feel like one. The collective response from several analysts and the market was something close to \"good riddance.\"\nScuttling the multibillion-dollar insurgent effort will allow Cupertino to focus on a broad AI strategy within the Apple ecosystem, said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.\nOthers have pointed to the way Apple's software and intuitive design have already reshaped the car industry through CarPlay, software that connects iPhones to cars, effectively transforming other companies' hardware into extensions of its walled garden.\nMusk's recent fuss over unlocking Tesla's AI potential makes Apple's car exit even more compelling. CEO Tim Cook already has multiple conduits for intimate data gathering and platforms for refining AI tools. Musk's vehicles are parked outside; Cook's screens tuck you in at night.\nBut there's something too on the nose and a little bleak about the world's most valuable company shuffling staff from its daring EV project to the trend of the moment, pursuing a more dazzling version of ChatGPT, or finding immersive ways to sink users more deeply into their couch. You'd think the phrase \"If you can't beat em, join em\" shouldn't apply to an enterprise packing hundreds of billions of dollars to throw at a problem.\nAt the company's annual shareholder meeting earlier this week, Cook said Apple will share details of its new AI features later this year. It's still not clear how AI will resuscitate Apple's growth story. But at least now we know where it won't come from.\nLegacy media is facing a two-pronged conundrum: TV networks are in decline as a dismal ad environment drags on revenue. In the meantime, streaming remains unprofitable for the majority of players as costs rise and subscriber growth stalls.\nMost recently, Paramount (PARA) reported linear ad revenue slumped 15% year over year in Q4, steeper than the 12% drop expected by analysts and also worse than the 14% drag seen in the third quarter.\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA) also saw ad revenue in their traditional broadcast and cable businesses slump this earnings season.\nIt's a tough spot for media companies, which have invested in expensive streaming endeavors amid the mass exodus of pay TV consumers.\nPrior to the cord-cutting phenomenon, linear advertising and cable affiliate fees had consistently boosted revenues. But as ad buyers now flee traditional TV channels in favor of digital options like streaming, companies are beginning to realize that they may never see the same level of returns.\nAdding on to financial pressures? The streaming boom may be over.\n\"The headlines have been unavoidable suggesting that the boom times are over and streaming video is in a new phase of sobriety,\" subscription analytics platform Antenna wrote in its quarterly \"State of Subscriptions\" report published on Tuesday.\nAntenna revealed that subscribers to premium subscription services grew at their slowest pace since before the pandemic began, rising just 10.1% compared to the 21.6% seen in 2022.\nOn top of slowing growth, churn \u2014 or subscribers canceling their streaming plans \u2014 has nearly tripled since 2019 with 140.5 million cancellations in 2023, the largest drop in subscribers over the last five years.\nAs consumer sign-ups slow, streaming profitability still has a long way to go. Virtually all media companies continue to lose money on that business, with the exception of Netflix and very recently Warner Bros. Discovery.\nBut even WBD's streaming turnaround wasn't enough to lift earnings in the fourth quarter, further highlighting the struggle of legacy media's balancing act. The company still reported a miss on both the top and bottom lines, dragged down by a drop in networks revenue and the ad market plummet.\nRead more here. \nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday:\nFisker (FSR): The automaker sank almost 40% Friday afternoon after unloading a cache of bad news during its Q4 earnings report Thursday. Fisker reported that given its financial condition, evolving dealership sales approach and challenging EV market, it has \u201csubstantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern\u201d when the company files its official financial statements for 2023. Fisker also said it would reduce its headcount by 15%.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F): Oil prices jumped 2% amid signs of tight supply, rising above $80 per barrel for the first time this year. Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also rose to trade above $83 per barrel.\nDell (DELL): Shares of the technology company rose 25% Friday morning following a quarterly sales and profit beat fueled by AI prospects for its servers.\nNew York Community Bancorp (NYCB): Shares tumbled 27% after the exit of its CEO, a $2.7 billion quarterly loss, and findings of \"material weaknesses\" in the bank's loan processes.\nApple (AAPL): Shares of the iPhone maker fell 1% after the stock was initially buoyed by a report that it had canceled its decade-long car project and would shift resources to its artificial intelligence efforts. During the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting earlier this week, CEO Tim Cook said Apple is investing significantly in AI and will break new ground in generative AI later this year.\nStocks gathered momentum in afternoon trading on Friday, building on February's rally and setting indexes up for record highs to start the new month.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6%, coming off a record close and best February in almost a decade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2% or about 70 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) rose 0.8%.\nOil futures rose as much as 3% on Friday to their highest levels since November, as market conditions point to tight supplies.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) jumped above $80 per barrel for the first time this year. Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also rose to trade above $83 per barrel.\nFriday's jump follows two consecutive months of gains. Greater-than-expected demand out of Asia coupled with expectations that oil alliance OPEC+ will extend its output reductions past March has helped lift contract prices.\n\"I think the rally in crude oil prices is on the expectation that OPEC+ will continue with their voluntary production cuts well into the second quarter of 2024,\" Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\nNear-term contracts are currently trading at a premium compared to later months, a market condition called \"backwardation\" which signals crude supply tightness.\nRead more here. \nMortgage rates have remained above 7% every day for the last two weeks. But one homebuilder says consumers are more willing to swallow higher rates than they used to be.\nAccording to Mortgage News Daily, the benchmark rate for a 30-year fixed-rate loan reached 7.16% on two separate days over the last week and settled at 7.1% on Thursday.\n\"The consumers have come a long way in the last year, 18 months, when rates were flirting at that 7%,\u201d Taylor Morrison (TMHC) CEO Sheryl Palmer told Yahoo Finance Live Thursday.\n\u201cBack then they were still hoping rates would go back to 4%. I think the consumer has met us kind of in the middle, recognizing that rates in the fives or sixes is actually, from any kind of long-term historic perspective, a really good rate,\u201d Palmer added.\nTaylor Morrison like others in the industry is able to offer such rates to buyers through incentives like mortgage rate buydowns, where the builder covers a portion of the interest paid on a loan.\n\u201cThe reality is every buyer needs something a little bit different,\u201d Palmer said.\n\u201c[Some] want a lower rate. \u2026The ability to personalize [rates] today, I think, is most important. But I think it's created a real advantage for the new home market versus that opportunity doesn't really exist in the existing market.\u201d\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has filed a lawsuit against the maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI, and its CEO Sam Altman over what he alleges is a breach of contract.\nMusk claims the company is no longer following its original goal of helping humanity, and is instead focused on profits.\n\"OpenAI has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world: Microsoft,\" the lawsuit states.\nMusk is asking the court to force OpenAI to make its research and technology publicly available and to block the AI company from using its assets to financially benefit Microsoft (MSFT) or other individuals.\nThe lawsuit comes as OpenAI faces a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is looking into whether investors in the company were misled following a chaotic overhaul of the company's governance structure in November. Amid these regulatory troubles, OpenAI is planning to appoint several new board members within the next month, the Washington Post reported Thursday.\nMusk stepped down from OpenAI's board in 2018 and has previously called for regulation on AI technology. The owner of the website formally known as Twitter and the CEO of SpaceX also claims his own AI startup, xAI. Musk's AI company launched its own ChatGPT rival dubbed Grok, available to X premium subscribers.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday:\nDell (DELL): Shares of the technology company rose 25% Friday morning following a quarterly sales and profit beat fueled by AI prospects for its servers.\nNew York Community Bancorp (NYCB): Shares tumbled 27% after the exit of its CEO, a $2.7 billion quarterly loss, and findings of \"material weaknesses\" in the bank's loan processes.\nAMD (AMD): The chip giant rose to record highs on Friday, increasing more than 4% as some analysts see further upside in the company's data center segment and investors pile AI-related stocks following Nividia's (NVDA) staggering climb.\nApple (AAPL): Shares of the iPhone maker fell 1% after the stock was initially buoyed by a report that it had canceled its decade-long car project and would shift resources to its artificial intelligence efforts. During the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting earlier this week, CEO Tim Cook said Apple is investing significantly in AI and will break new ground in generative AI later this year.\nWall Street rung in the first trading day of March with mixed results as momentum from the prior blowout month ebbed.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.1%, after the benchmark index's record close and best February in almost a decade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 0.1%, or about 50 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) rose 0.2%.\nNew day, same old signs of a tech bubble.\nShares of formerly sleepy Dell (DELL) are up 31% pre-market because it spent most of its earnings call last night talking about AI. Yes, the same Dell that sold you your first desktop computer in the 1990s.\nScenes from Dell's earnings call:\n\"We have positioned ourselves well in AI. We've already started to benefit from the momentum we're seeing. We saw strong demand continue for our AI-optimized server portfolio, including our flagship PowerEdge XE9680, which remains the fastest-ramping solution in company history. We have just started to touch the AI opportunities ahead of us, including broader adoption of AI by enterprise customers and the projected growth in unstructured data where we are well positioned with industry-leading storage solutions.\" \u2014 Jeff Clarke, Dell COO\n\"AI-optimized server orders increased by nearly 40% sequentially. We shipped $800 million of AI-optimized servers, and our backlog nearly doubled sequentially, exiting the fiscal year at $2.9 billion. Demand continues to outpace GPU supply, though we are seeing H100 lead times improving. We are also seeing strong interest in orders for AI-optimized servers equipped with the next generation of AI GPUs, including the H200 and the MI300X.\" Jeff Clarke\nThe hyper AI-infused Dell call prompted this report headline from JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee:\n\"Just What the Investors Ordered With AI-Led ISG Acceleration; Raise Estimates and PT\"\nI guess nothing more to see here \u2014 Dell apparently is no longer a PC seller, but an AI beast that is going to change the world alongside Nvidia (NVDA)!\nWelcome to the bubble, friends.\nI remember it like it was yesterday.\nI was sitting in a meeting room with former Cisco (CSCO) CEO John Chambers, just a casual meeting to see what he was up to in life after leading the networking giant. Rather than discuss where he was playing golf next, Chambers went on and on about then Cisco board member and AMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su.\n\"Watch Lisa Su, watch what she does over the next few years,\" Chambers told me (I still have the comment written down in my phone's notepad).\nThe market has more than watched what Su has done since joining the former also-ran AMD as CEO in 2014. It has become a believer in the humble, focused leadership of Su and the results she continues to drive for shareholders.\nThe company broke through the $300 billion market cap level on Thursday and is poised to tack on more gains today.\nSu refuses to play second fiddle in the AI chip race to rival Nvidia (NVDA), led by the black-leather-jacket-wearing Jensen Huang. Su isn't awestruck by Intel (INTC) building chip factories in the US.\nShe just gets transformational things done, period. And right now, that includes rolling out very powerful AI chips to supply an under-supplied market.\n\"There are going to be multiple winners in this market,\" Su told me in early December. \"I think there's a great growth opportunity for us; we expect to gain market share.\"\nThat December interview from Yahoo Finance Live below.\n"

        "Text": "Company\u2019s XDP-AccelKV Universally Accelerates Database Analytics, Vector Databases, AI Training/Inference with GPU Storage\nHarnessing Data Accelerators for Vector Databases\nSAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- While the global AI market is projected to reach a staggering $407 billion by 2027, in order for widespread adoption to be achieved, the scalability challenges of modern AI/Generative AI (Gen AI) applications need to be addressed. Pliops, a leading provider of data processors for cloud and enterprise data centers, will be on hand at NVIDIA GTC this week to tackle these challenges head on. Pliops XDP-AccelKV universal data acceleration engine significantly minimizes the scalability challenges of AI/Gen AI applications.\nWhat\u2019s holding AI applications back? The memory capacity and bandwidth limitations of GPUs to load AI/Gen AI models prevent them from fully utilizing their computational power.

        "Text": "The impeccable rally in Nvidia NVDA\u00a0and AMD\u2019s AMD\u00a0stock has started to wear thin over the last few weeks but of course, corrections can be healthy.\nTo that point, investors may once again be pondering if it\u2019s time to buy the dip in these chip leaders as semiconductor development for artificial intelligence remains in high demand.\nSuper AI Chip Competition \nLuring the buy-the-dip scenario is that on Monday Nvidia announced a new processer design along with a family of chips called Blackwell which it says will now be the most powerful artificial intelligence transistors on the market.\nMeanwhile, AMD has largely entered the conversation of new accelerators and processors for AI with its MI300 series chips. AMD\u2019s MI300X chips helped the company take market share by battling Nvidia\u2019s popular H100 series chips which have been used to train large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI\u2019s chat GPT.\nHowever, it's noteworthy that Nvidia has upped the ante as its most recent H200 and GH200 \u201csuper chip\u201d was an upgrade to its AI computing platform and already the market leader before its newly announced Blackwell series.\nMarket Value \nFor now, Nvidia and AMD are considered the leaders in the semiconductor development for AI chips followed by Intel INTC\u00a0with the market thought to be worth upwards of $60 billion. More intriguing, the AI chip market has a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) that is projected at 30% or higher in the coming years.\nImage Source: Statista\nRecent Performances & 52 Week Range\nAt the moment Nvidia\u2019s stock trades just under $900 and roughly 8% from its 52-week highs of $974 a share seen earlier in the month. Nvidia\u2019s stock is more than 250% above its 52-week lows of $251.30 a share seen last March.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAMD\u2019s stock trades around $182 and has dipped 25% from its 52-week peak of $227.30 a share which it hit a few weeks ago as well. That said, AMD\u2019s stock has soared 125% above its lows of $81.02 a share witnessed last May.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nYear to date, Nvidia\u2019s stock has soared +80% while AMD shares are still up +23% with both impressively topping the broader indexes and largely outperforming Intel\u2019s -16%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGrowth Comparisons\nGlancing at the outlook for Nvidia, total sales are projected to soar 70% in its current fiscal 2025 to $103.49 billion compared to $60.92 billion in FY24. Even better, FY26 sales are expected to jump another 15%. On the bottom line, Nvidia\u2019s annual earnings are forecasted to leap 81% in FY25 to $23.49 per share versus $12.96 a share in FY24. Fiscal 2025 EPS is projected to rise another 11% to $26.06 per share.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPivoting to AMD, its top line is expected to expand 11% in its current FY24 and climb another 22% in FY25 to $30.97 billion. Annual earnings are projected to climb 30% this year and soar another 46% in FY25 to $5.05 per share.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nDeciding Factor\nThere is no question that competition is great for the market as it relates to technological advancements. Still, Nvidia continues to have the edge in the development of semiconductors for artificial intelligence after further cementing its dominance with the Blackwell series and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while AMD lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\u00a0\u00a0\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Could Arm Holdings Become the Next Nvidia?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Back in 2020, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) declared it would buy U.K. chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) from SoftBank for $40 billion. That acquisition would have added Arm's chip designs, which are already used in more than 95% of the world's mobile devices, to Nvidia's massive chipmaking business.\nHowever, that deal was terminated in 2022, after antitrust regulators claimed it would give Nvidia an unfair advantage against its industry peers. Nvidia would no longer have paid Arm licensing fees for its own Arm-based Tegra chips, but other chipmakers -- including Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Apple -- would still have paid Nvidia licensing fees for those designs.\nLast September, SoftBank spun off Arm in an IPO at $51 per share. Investors initially shrugged at that offering, since its growth was cooling off and its valuations were high. However, the stabilization of the smartphone market and expansion of the AI market brought back the bulls -- and its stock soared to its current price of about $127.\nSo could Arm follow Nvidia's footsteps and become the next hot AI chip stock? Or will it struggle to justify its soaring valuations?\nArm doesn't manufacture any chips of its own. It only designs CPUs and licenses those designs to other chipmakers. Arm-based CPUs generally aren't as powerful as the x86 CPUs produced by Intel and AMD, but they're more compact and power-efficient, which makes them well-suited for mobile devices.\nHowever, Arm's heavy exposure to the smartphone market is a double-edged sword. Its licensing fees and royalties soared in fiscal 2022, which ended in March 2022 as smartphone makers sold more 5G devices, but they declined in fiscal 2023 as the 5G upgrade cycle ended and the macro headwinds rattled the market.\nOn the bright side, Arm's pricing power in mobile chip designs kept its gross margin in the mid-90s even as its revenue growth cooled off, and its adjusted operating margins rose even as it ramped up its spending on new chip designs. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, Arm's revenue rose year over year again, its gross margin held steady, and its adjusted operating margins expanded.\nMetric\nFY 2022\nFY 2023\n9M 2024\nRevenue growth (YOY)\n33%\n(1%)\n13%\nGross margin\n95%\n96%\n95%\nAdjusted operating margin\n27%\n29%\n43%\nData source: Arm Holdings. YOY = Year-over-year.\nThe company attributed that recovery to the stabilization of the smartphone market, robust demand for its AI-enabled Armv9 handset chip designs that have higher royalty rates, market share gains for its Armv9 chips in the cloud server market, and strong sales of Arm-based chips for advanced driver assistance systems in new vehicles. All of those tailwinds offset its headwinds across the Internet of Things, embedded, and automotive microcontroller markets.\nFor the full year, Arm expects its revenue to grow 18%-20%, its adjusted operating margin to expand to a midpoint of 53%, and its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to come in between $1.20 and $1.24. That outlook seems healthy, but Arm's stock already trades at 40 times this year's sales and 105 times this year's earnings.\nFor fiscal 2025, analysts expect Arm's revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 25% and 28%, respectively, as its core markets expand. But based on those estimates, its stock still looks pricey at 82 times forward earnings and 34 times next year's sales.\nBy comparison, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 81% and 90%, respectively, in fiscal 2025, which ends next January. However, Nvidia trades at only 36 times forward earnings and 20 times this year's sales.\nArm seems to be fetching a premium valuation as more chipmakers license its higher-end chip designs for new AI applications. But investors shouldn't confuse Arm's CPU designs with Nvidia's GPUs, which play a much more important role in processing machine learning and AI tasks. Arm also still generates most of its revenue from the cyclical smartphone market instead of cloud servers or connected vehicles.\nArm's business still has room to grow as it rolls out its pricier chip designs, but the AI hype is inflating its valuations to unsustainable levels. Investors shouldn't confuse Arm with Nvidia, which is a much simpler \"pick and shovel\" play on the booming AI market, and realize that its stock has rallied a bit too far ahead of its actual business.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Arm Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Why SoundHound AI, Nvidia, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Rallied Today",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's little question that the catalyst that sparked the current bull market rally is artificial intelligence (AI). The AI gold rush that kicked off last year is gathering steam, but market watchers continue to question the resilience of this upward momentum. However, robust results from one company provided a lift for a number of AI stocks.\nWith that as a backdrop, audio AI specialist SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) surged 13.6%, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) climbed 4.9%, and social media maven Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) climbed 2.4%, as of 1:47 p.m. ET.\nA check of all the usual suspects -- financial reports, regulatory filings, and changes to analysts' price targets -- turned up nothing in the way of catalysts to explain the move higher. This seems to suggest that it was the results of another company that drove AI stocks upward.\nThe catalyst that seems to have sparked a rally among AI stocks was a surprisingly strong earnings report from database specialist Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). The results provided evidence that demand for AI is spreading.\nFor its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Feb. 29), Oracle reported revenue of $13.3 billion, which grew 7% year over year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.41, up 16%. While that might not seem like much to write home about, the devil is in the details, with two items of particular interest.\nOracle's cloud revenue was the headliner, growing 25% year over year to $5.1 billion. Even more impressive was the company's cloud infrastructure results, which climbed 52% year over year. This outpaced the growth of Amazon Web Services, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure -- also known as the \"Big Three\" cloud providers -- which grew 13%, 26%, and 30%, respectively. This suggests that either Oracle took market share from its closest cloud competitors, or that demand for cloud services is growing -- though both could be true.\nFurthermore, the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO), or contractually obligated sales not yet booked as revenue, surged 29% to $80 billion. Since RPO gives insight in future revenue trends, this suggests Oracle's sales growth seems destined to continue.\nOracle CEO Safra Catz also noted that AI cloud capacity \"substantially exceeds supply.\" As a result, Oracle is \"opening new and expanding existing cloud data centers very, very rapidly.\"\nThe chief executive also noted the company recently signed a \"big Generation 2 cloud infrastructure contract with Nvidia\" in the third quarter, but also hinted there's more on the docket. \"We expect to have some very nice joint announcements with Nvidia next week\" during Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference (GTC).\nThis all but confirms that it was the accelerating demand for AI that boosted Oracle's results, which has broader implications for other companies in the AI space.\nWe're only just beginning to comprehend just how prevalent generative AI will be, but these highlighted companies have each carved out a niche for themselves in the AI gold rush:\nSoundHound AI creates AI-powered voice and audio solutions serving the restaurant and automotive industries. The company's tools can be used for restaurant drive-thrus, phone banks, and self-serve kiosks, among others.\nNvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) with the computational horsepower required by AI systems. The company has generated triple-digit year-over-year sales growth in each of the preceding three quarters thanks to growing demand for AI.\nMeta Platforms has long used AI to advance its business, surfacing relevant content to its social media users, as well as directing its targeted advertising efforts. Meta also developed LLaMA AI, one of the most in-demand large language models available on the major cloud infrastructure sites.\nEach of these stocks is relatively inexpensive, depending on your favored valuation metric. Meta and Nvidia currently sell for 25 times and 36 times forward earnings, respectively, making them the standout choices -- particularly given their history of strong growth. SoundHound AI isn't yet profitable and sells for 20 times sales, making it more expensive and certainly riskier.\nThe trend toward AI adoption is unmistakable, offering investors plenty of ways to profit from the AI revolution.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAs of 2024-04-01, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $379.69. It's currently trading at a price of $902.7. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -137.75%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$12.15\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.21%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 41.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n591.55\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n1000.21\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n379.69\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $338.47. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -166.7%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Chris Morris, Prarthana Prakash ",
        "Text": "Novo Nordisk is a behemoth by all accounts. The pharma company of Ozempic and Wegovy fame recently surpassed Tesla in its market value, after leapfrogging French conglomerate LVMH.\nThe only other company, in recent memory, that's seen supersized growth is the chip designer Nvidia.\nNow, imagine a crossover between these two titans.\nThe Novo Nordisk Foundation, the Danish organization which owns the drugmaker that makes Ozempic and Wegovy, is investing some of the money those blockbuster drugs have earned into a supercomputer. The group will collaborate with with Nvidia to develop \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful\u201d AI supercomputer, according to an announcement by the foundation on Tuesday.\nThe company has contracted Eviden, a French tech company, to build \u201cGefion,\u201d to help it discover new medicines and treatments. It\u2019s expected to be operational before the end of the year.\n\"The AI supercomputer [will] \u2026 provide an unprecedented potential to accelerate groundbreaking scientific discoveries in areas such as drug discovery, disease diagnosis and treatment,\u201d said Dr. C\u00e9dric Bourrasset, the head of quantum computing at Eviden, in a statement. \u201cThis new supercomputer will be a powerful resource to further boost AI research and collaboration between academia and Danish industry in Denmark\u2019s already thriving AI-based research ecosystem.\u201d\nThe Nvidia-backed Gefion will use the company\u2019s latest chips, announced this week, to approach the queries scientists throw at it.\nIt will be built at Denmark\u2019s national center for AI innovation\u2014and will be available for use by researchers in both the private and public sectors of the country.\nThe Novo Nordisk Foundation typically awards grants worth DKK 5 billion ($730 million) each year in the fields of science and social work. It\u2019s pumped roughly DKK 600 million ($87 million) into the initial costs on this project, which will be used by Denmark\u2019s public and private sector researchers.\n\u201cDrug discovery, disease diagnosis, and treatment, as well as complicated life science challenges, are examples of areas where extreme AI computing power can enable the positive transformation of our society,\u201d the Foundation\u2019s chief Mads Krogsgaard said.\nThe Foundation\u2019s senior vice president Lene Oddershede told Fortune that the technology it\u2019s backing would \u201cvery likely\u201d be used by its pharma company, Novo Nordisk, and will be implemented \u201con market terms.\u201d\nOddershede also added that the supercomputer\u2019s use cases go well beyond just the drug-making industry, helping address issues such as climate change and sustainable foods.\nThe popularity of Ozempic and Wegovy has made Novo Nordisk a stock-market power, overtaking Tesla in recent weeks, and has helped propel Denmark\u2019s economy to become the third-most prosperous in Europe.\nBeyond the supercomputer, the company is using some of that income to build a \u201cmega manufacturing facility\u201d outside of Dublin to help it keep up with soaring demand.\nNvidia and Eviden have been contacted by Fortune for comment.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "7 AI Stocks That Will Trounce Nvidia\u2019s Returns in 2025",
        "Author": "  Omor Ibne Ehsan ",
        "Text": "AI stocks have been on a tear recently, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) once again breaking records and crossing above $950 per share. However, as I\u2019ve cautioned many times before, this is a stock that investors need to be very careful with at these levels. While I would not recommend shorting Nvidia, the company does face significant downside risk if the AI rally loses steam. At the same time, there is not a whole lot of upside potential left after the meteoric rise.\nThat\u2019s not to say Nvidia couldn\u2019t potentially climb even higher \u2013 $1,000 per share or more is certainly possible if the momentum continues carrying it upward. But purely chasing momentum gains above $950 would not be a smart move in my view. Instead, investors should look to more under-the-radar AI stocks that have significant organic growth potential in the coming quarters and years. Here are seven that could trounce Nvidia\u2019s gains next year:\nSource: Owlie Productions / Shutterstock.com\nAt first glance, GigaCloud Technology\u2019s (NASDAQ:GCT) name may seem a bit misleading. That\u2019s because this is not actually a cloud computing company at all. Instead, GCT operates a B2B marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of furniture and other large goods. The company also provides logistics intelligence services, which I believe puts it squarely in the AI sector as well. Moreover, furniture and related companies have seen significant downtrends in their businesses lately that could be poised for a breakout rebound in the coming months.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nGCT\u2019s recent results have been stellar. The company has increased its revenue by 95% to $245 million and net income rose by 185% to $35.6 million. Looking ahead, revenue is expected to rise above $1 billion in 2024 alongside 50% year-over-year growth. Earnings per share should hit $2.6 this year. EPS is then forecasted to reach $4.2 in 2026, alongside revenue hitting $1.6 billion. In exchange for this tremendous growth, you\u2019re paying just 11 times forward earnings and 1 times forward sales \u2013 extremely cheap valuations for a high-growth software company. I don\u2019t believe the $402 million debt load changes this thesis either, as GCT generates significant cash flow and has $243 million in cash to help offset it.\nSince I first covered this stock in an article last year, the share price has more than doubled. The recent correction looks to me like a prime entry point for the next leg up in this exciting AI play. While not yet a household name, GigaCloud Technology has all the ingredients for huge returns if execution remains strong.\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nUpstart\u2019s (NASDAQ:UPST) stock price was up nearly 400% at one point since I first touted the AI lending platform back in early 2023. While the stock has given back some gains and is now up around 100% since then, I stand by my initial bullish call. I continue to believe Upstart can climb much higher over the long term.\nMost of Upstart\u2019s challenges lately stem from banks facing pressures and taking fewer risks. With economic uncertainty high, banks are hesitant to try new technologies like Upstart\u2019s platform. Moreover, consumers have delayed major purchases for the past two years amid rising rates, and cratering demand for loans. However, I expect the tide to turn as the Fed pivots to rate cuts, spurring more borrowing activity. This should significantly benefit Upstart as banks again need credit risk capabilities.\nLooking out, I see revenue potentially topping $1 billion in 2026, alongside expanding profitability. EPS could hit $1 that year, and some analysts estimate as high as $1.26. If achieved, that kind of income growth at reasonable valuations would send the stock soaring. While the path may be bumpy depending on the economy, I remain confident in Upstart\u2019s innovative AI over the long run.\nSource: everything possible / Shutterstock.com\nT Stamp (NASDAQ:IDAI) is one of the more smaller AI stocks, with its modest size allowing for potentially huge returns if the business takes off. IDAI provides identity authentication software solutions using AI-powered biometrics, cryptography, and data mining. Their tech aims to predict identity/trustworthiness, prevent fraudulent attacks, and protect sensitive user data.\nCoverage and forecasts on IDAI are limited given its nano-cap status. However, I view the stock as a worthwhile gamble at around 90 cents per share after falling close to its July 2023 floor price. Revenue grew 127% year-over-year to $3 million last quarter. Its market cap sits at just $8.3 million currently. My biggest worry is the cash burn, likely requiring some dilution before reaching profitability. But if IDAI gains traction, the upside in this cybersecurity play could be enormous.\nSource: Shutterstock\nAmpliTech Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMPG) is a technology company designing, engineering, and assembling microwave component-based amplifiers. Their products include radio frequency (RF) amplifiers and related subsystems used in communication systems like Wi-Fi, radar, satellite, and cell phones.\nThis is not directly an \u201cAI\u201d firm, but AMPG does employ AI in many operations, as most companies do today. What matters is they are in high-tech sectors with solid growth runways. However, stellar financials are lacking currently. Revenue is expected to dive to $15.6 million in 2023 from over $19.4 million in 2022, alongside expected reversion to unprofitability.\nSo why do I view AMPG as a promising buy? The future looks bright. The company should deliver triple-digit growth in 2024, propelling revenue to $32 million and EPS back into positive terrain. The 2024 revenue estimate puts the stock at a mere 0.6 times sales, very inexpensive. I believe this could catalyze a breakout above $2. If execution goes smoothly, 2024 could mark the start of a high-growth, profitable period for AMPG.\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nKlaviyo (NYSE:KVYO) is a marketing automation platform used by over 143,000 companies globally. It helps businesses to activate customer data in real-time for things like targeted email, SMS, mobile push, and reviews.\nNaturally, this is a much larger company. Firms engaging in marketing, customer relations, and related software often trade at steep premiums, and KVYO is no exception. However, I still see upside if it meets estimates. Analysts anticipate EPS climbing from 45 cents to 73 cents from 2024 to 2026 alongside revenue surging from $893 million to $1.5 billion from 2024 to 2027. Though expensive at 57 times forward earnings, this seems reasonable given the immense growth.\nWhat makes me bullish are Q3 and Q4 EPS surprises of 78.5% and 15%, plus revenue surprises of 5.2% and 2.8%. If KVYO keeps posting major surprises, multibagger gains could come in 2-3 years. The future looks bright if execution remains best-in-class.\nSymbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM) is an automation technology firm focused on boosting operating efficiencies in modern warehouses and supply chains. As I\u2019ve articulated before, the current AI revolution is concentrated on white-collar industries but will likely spill into blue-collar domains. Repetitive tasks like factory work can easily be automated with sufficient machine learning. Human ingenuity is needed for jobs like plumbing, but warehouses can easily be automated.\nSymbotic helps companies automate warehouses with its software, fitting squarely into this trend. The stock trades at a towering premium \u2013 26 times book value. However, this seems reasonable given the market is thinking ahead. EPS is projected to surge from 18 cents in 2024 to 87 cents in 2026, alongside revenue growth from $1.74 billion to $3.5 billion. I believe an even higher premium is warranted long-term. Revenue could potentially eclipse $15 billion in the next eight years as automation adoption accelerates, with substantial EPS expansion too.\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\nLumine Group (OTCMKTS:LMGIF) spun out from Constellation Group (OTCMKTS:CNSWF) last year, focuses on communications and media software. It actively incorporates artificial intelligence into offerings, acquiring Neural Technologies in 2021 to enhance its AI offerings. This explains the strong stock momentum \u2013 nearly 130% gains since the spin-off.\nLMGIF is a technology company with immense growth runways. The future 3-5-year average annual revenue growth estimate sits near 50%. Notably, LMGIF is not as unprofitable as it seems. The huge 2023 net loss decline mainly resulted from a $2.8 billion increase in the fair value of redeemable preferred and special securities. Analysts expect substantial profit growth in coming years as top-line expansion surges.\nIf LMGIF can continue executing on its AI-driven product roadmap, I see plenty of upside ahead. The company operates in a massive addressable market and is poised to capture share if it can sustain rapid product innovation. The growth trajectory looks highly promising at the moment.\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Title": "Cathie Wood's Ark Invest Is Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Cathie Wood is the CEO and chief investment officer at Ark Invest, an asset management firm focused on disruptive innovation. Wood and her team manage several thematic index funds that offer exposure to technologies like artificial intelligence (AI).\nArk sold down its position in Nvidia throughout February, and the selling has continued in March. That may strike readers as strange given that Nvidia chips are the gold standard in AI infrastructure. But Nvidia shares have soared 260% over the past year, so it appears Ark is taking profits and reinvesting capital into other AI companies.\nFor instance, Wood and her team have been buying shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) in March. Here's what investors should know about the electric carmaker.\nTesla reported disappointing financial results in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased just 3% year over year to $25.1 billion, operating margin contracted nearly 800 basis points, and non-GAAP net income declined 39% to $2.5 billion. The company also expects vehicle volume to grow more slowly this year as it prepares its next-generation, low-cost vehicle platform. But there is some good news for shareholders.\nTesla's disappointing financial results can be attributed to macroeconomic headwinds. The company cut prices throughout the year to offset muted demand caused by high interest rates. Those price cuts stunted revenue growth and cut deeply into margins. But top-line growth and profitability should improve as interest rates begin falling, which could happen later this year.\nAdditionally, Tesla still led the industry in battery electric vehicle sales last year, capturing 19.1% market share, up from 18.2% in 2022. That means the company is well positioned to benefit as electric vehicles continue to displace internal combustion engines. To quantify that opportunity, Grand View Research says electric vehicle sales will grow 15% annually through 2030.\nFinally, Tesla plans to build a next-generation vehicle in late 2025 that could support market share gains. That vehicle will be assembled with new manufacturing technology that could reduce production costs by 50%, according to management. In turn, the company will be able to sell these new vehicles at a much lower price than current models, perhaps as low as $25,000, meaning more consumers will be able to afford a Tesla.\nMuch like Apple monetizes its devices with add-ons like cloud storage, Tesla hopes to monetize its vehicles with adjacent software and services. For instance, the company recently opened its Supercharger network to third-party automakers. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives believes paid charging could generate $10 billion to $20 billion in annual revenue by 2030.\nSimilarly, Tesla sells full self-driving (FSD) beta subscriptions in certain geographies, and demand should increase as the product approaches true autonomy. Tesla also plans to monetize FSD with licensing deals and mobility (robotaxi) services in the future. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas believes FSD software and mobility services could generate $70 billion in annual revenue by 2030.\nTesla is already a leader in autonomous driving technology. Its Dojo supercomputer is purpose-built for training artificial intelligence (AI) vision systems, and it reportedly offers six times better performance than GPU alternatives. Tesla also has 50 times more driving data than its closest competitor. That combination gives the company an important advantage.\nSpecifically, Tesla should be able to train its AI models more effectively than its peers, meaning FSD can be superior to other autonomous driving platforms. Data from Ark Invest supports that theory. Tesla's in FSD mode experience roughly one crash per 3.2 million miles, making them 16 times safer than the national average (one crash per 192,000 miles) and six times safer than Waymo's autonomous vehicles (one crash per 476,000 miles).\nTesla has not provided a specific timeline for branching into mobility services, but in April 2022, CEO Elon Musk said the company hopes to achieve volume production of a dedicated robotaxi in 2024. More recently, Musk told CNBC that FSD software and autonomous ridesharing services could push gross margins to 70%, up from 18% last year.\nWall Street expects Tesla to grow sales 16% annually over the next five years, but that figure encompasses a wide range of estimates given the uncertainty surrounding its FSD technology. For instance, Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley thinks Tesla could grow sales 19% annually over the next seven years, and Cathie Wood at Ark Invest thinks sales could grow 60% annually through 2027.\nThe variation between those estimates makes life difficult for investors. The stock currently trades at 6.3 times sales, a tolerable valuation if the Wall Street consensus is correct, a reasonable valuation if Morgan Stanley is correct, and a dirt-cheap valuation if Ark Invest is correct. With that in mind, investors who think Tesla can meaningfully monetize FSD should consider buying a few shares today.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Text": "NEAR is trading at $7.00, its highest level since May 2022, after rising by 20% in the past 24 hours.\nPrice action has been spurred by the NEAR founder's attendance as a speaker at Nvidia's AI conference next week.\nNEAR will soon introduce Near Tasks, a new product focused on AI.\nLayer-1 blockchain NEAR's native token {{NEAR}} has almost doubled since March 5 as the hype surrounding Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming annual conference continues to drive AI-related tokens to the upside.\nNear Protocol co-founder and CEO Illia Polosukhin will be on a panel at the conference titled \"Transforming AI\" and will be hosted by Nvidia's founder and CEO Jensen Huang. His attendance and the upcoming release of Near Tasks, an artificial intelligence (AI) facet of the business, has sparked discussion over whether NEAR will work closely with Nvidia in the future. The company seems to be only crypto-related firm that will be presenting at the main panel.\nNear's gains are mirrored across the crypto AI market, with the likes of fetch.ai {{FET}}, the graph {{GRT}} and singularityNET {{AGIX}} all posting gains of more than 30% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. The CoinDesk 20 index (CD20) has risen by 9.18% in the same period.\nThe surge has also been buoyed by bitcoin recording a record high of $72,446 on Monday.\nAdding to the bullish sentiment, crypto venture capital firm DeFiance Capital's CEO Arthur Cheong wrote on a social media post that \"the future is NEAR\" on Monday after the token rose by an additional 20% to $7.00, its highest level since May, 2022. On March 5, it was trading at $3.60\nThe company started as NEAR.AI in 2017, an AI company that had nothing to do with blockchain. The team began building the NEAR protocol in 2018, and the mainnet was rolled out in 2020. Prior to starting Near, Polosukhin was at Google Research, where he worked on developing models and tools that would eventually feed into AI.\nNear is a proof-of-stake blockchain that relies on a consensus protocol called Nightshade, which allows Near to operate at about 100,000 transactions per second, and process a block a second. The token currently has a market cap of $7.45 billion, according to CoinDesk data.\nRead more: Illia Polosukhin: Building Near's Blockchain, Embedding AI\n"

        "Title": "Stock market today: Nvidia, Tesla drag tech stocks lower as S&P 500 pulls back from record",
        "Author": " Karen Friar    and  Josh Schafer    ",
        "Text": "US stocks were a mixed bag on Wednesday with the S&P 500's (^GSPC) record-setting run hitting pause as several tech giants saw their stocks retreat.\nThe S&P 500 was off about 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses, falling more than 0.5% after tech led Tuesday's rally. High-flying Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 1%, while Tesla (TSLA) fell over 4.5% after a Wells Fargo downgrade and sales warning.\nStocks had gained Tuesday, with the S&P 500 hitting a new record amid continued optimism that the Federal Reserve will start to cut interest rates within months despite February's hotter-than-estimated reading on core consumer inflation.\nThat alone could prompt policymakers to stay cautious about easing up on borrowing costs when the Fed holds its monthly policy meeting next week. But with the US economy outstripping Wall Street's forecasts, investors are keeping their hopes warm until they get wholesale inflation and retail sales data on Thursday.\nOn the crypto front, bitcoin (BTC-USD) was changing hands above $73,000, continuing a furious, record-setting rally of its own.\nIn corporates, DollarTree's (DLTR) shares sank about 14% after the company swung to a quarterly loss. The discount retailer said it plans to close nearly 1,000 stores and will take a charge of over $1 billion.\nA quiet day of trading for some of the market's biggest names saw the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lead the declines.\nBut under the surface, there's been a sector rotation underway and new S&P 500 sectors are hitting fresh record closes. Materials (XLB) joined the list on Wednesday, notching its first record high since Dec. 31, 2021.\nA rise in gas prices contributed to February's hotter-than-expected inflation print. And more pain at the pump for consumers is expected in the coming weeks.\nYahoo Finance's Ines Ferre reports: \nDrivers can expect to pay higher prices at the pump in the coming weeks due to tighter gasoline supplies and a more expensive summer blend.\nOn Wednesday, the average price of gas in the US inched toward $3.40 per gallon, up $0.18 from a month ago, according to AAA data.\n\"This week, Gulf Coast refiners, which account for nearly 50% of the nation's refining capacity began to transition to the more expensive summer grade gasoline blends. That means that higher prices are ahead for consumers,\" wrote Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates in a note to clients on Wednesday.\n\"I expect further increases of another 10 to 15 cents per gallon over the next two weeks.\"\nThe February Consumer Price Index showed inflation remains stickier than initially hoped. A key driver in that reading was the shelter index, which saw an overall price increase of 5.7% during the month of February compared to the same month last year.\nWithin that index is owners' equivalent rent, which saw a 0.4% monthly gain in February. Notably, this was a move down from the surprising 0.6% monthly increase seen in January.\nEconomists suspect these price increases are set to slow further moving forward, though, as indicators in the private market \u2014 which aren't lagging like the CPI rent index \u2014 have decreased significantly over th fumio kishidae past year.\n\"Through the recent monthly volatility, the trend in housing inflation remains downward,\" Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. \"Both the year-over-year rate of OER and rent of primary residences registered the smallest increases since the summer of 2022, and a further slide appears in store with private-sector measures of rent growth having largely returned to their pre-pandemic rates.\"\nUS Steel (X) stock fell more than 12% in afternoon trade following a report from the Financial Times that President Biden plans to express serious concern over Nippon Steel's proposed $14.9 billion purchase of US. Steel.\nBiden will issue the statement about the planned deal before Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida attends a state visit in Washington on April 18, per the FT.\nWow.\nI have been at this gig for 20 years, 10 of which were spent on the sell-side covering retail stocks. In all my time doing this, I have never seen a retailer come out and say they would close 1,000 stores like Dollar Tree (DLTR) said today. This is shocking news for a company that has opened thousands of stores the past decade.\nThe stock is crashing 15%, as it should.\nWhat a disaster.\nJust three months ago the Dollar Tree's executive team \u2014 led by former hyped Dollar General (DG) CEO Rick Dreiling \u2014 was telling investors it would open 600 stores in 2023. Some three months later, it's closing 1,000 stores in part because of the failed acquisition of rival Family Dollar (former ticker: FDO for you investing historians out there).\nWhile a few analysts have already come out praising Dollar Tree for announcing the store closures (it will save them money over time, supposedly), let's keep in mind that it's hard to trust Dollar Tree executives here after such an about-face.\nThe company's exit from towns really sticks it to low-income consumers, likely leading them to make tough decisions when shopping at the more expensive Walmart (WMT) if they live nearby one. The closures will also likely weigh on the near-term performance of the entire dollar store sector, and perhaps trigger other players to close stores.\nIn turn, more consumers stand to struggle.\nThe stock is a show me story at best for the time being.\nMorgan Stanley analysts think US home prices will be on the decline by the end of this year.\n\u201cThe increase in housing supply broadly, and for-sale inventory specifically, continue to drive our call for -3% [home price appreciation] by December 2024,\u201d James Egan, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday with the firm's housing research team.\nHousing prices logged their 11th consecutive monthly gain in December, advancing 0.2% from the previous month the Case-Shiller Index showed Feb. 27 as tight existing home inventory keeps a floor on prices. On a yearly basis, home price growth accelerated to 5.5% from 5%.\nThe move upward comes as mortgage rates dropped below 7% for the first time in a month, spurring housing activity. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate slid 18 basis points, the biggest drop in nearly three months, to 6.84% for the week ending March 8, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. \nMeanwhile, for-sale inventory slowly climbed from historical lows this month, growing by 14.8% and logging a fourth consecutive month of growth, per data from Realtor.com. \nThis also coincides with builders picking up more construction projects as single-family housing starts are up 8% since June and permits are up 9% from last year.\nDollar Tree (DLTR) led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page as shares tumbled nearly 15%. The dollar-store chain's announcement that it would close nearly 1,000 stores was part of a quarterly release that also included lower quarterly revenue and earnings per share than Wall Street analysts had projected.\nBlock (SQ) stock jumped more than 5% in morning trade. The move came after Afterpay, which is owned by Block, revealed it has added more merchants to its buy now, pay later services.\nTesla (TSLA) stock fell more than 2% after Wells Fargo analysts called the electric vehicle maker a \"growth company with no growth in a note that downgraded the stock to Underweight from Equalweight. The stock is now down more than 30% this year.\nThe House of Representatives advanced a bill that would give China's ByteDance six months to divest TikTok or face a US ban on the app on Wednesday morning.\nYahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports:\nThe vote surfaced national security concerns and scrambled Washington's usual partisan alliances.\n\"We have given TikTok a clear choice,\" Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington said Wednesday. If ByteDance doesn't divest, the company will \"side with the [Chinese Communist Party] and face the consequences.\"\nBut the legislation faces major hurdles in the weeks ahead. The Senate has shown less enthusiasm and is concerned about potential legal potholes. The signals from the upper chamber are that it could consider the bill slowly, if at all.\nThe proceedings in the House were injected with a dose of drama after a last-minute reversal from former President Trump on the issue following four years in office where he'd aggressively pushed for a ban.\nNonetheless, a large majority of the chamber's Republicans ended up bucking their party\u2019s presumptive nominee and supported the bipartisan bill with 197 in favor and just 15 opposed.\nThe measure was also opposed by 50 Democrats, with some on the party's left flank suggesting getting behind a ban could hurt the party with young voters this November.\nThe overall vote was a broad bipartisan tally of 352-65.\nThe bill, if enacted, would set in motion a process that could lead to a ban on a key news source for young people and one with 170 million American users. But it's also an app that collects vast amounts of information about Americans and is owned by a company, ByteDance, that its critics say is under the control of the Chinese government.\nByteDance executives regularly deny the charge and say they operate separately from China's government. The company previously slammed this week's bill in a statement, saying \"this legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States\" and adding it will \"destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country.\"\nYesterday's market action brought a reversal to the recent theory that a broadening was starting to take place in the stock market.\nA rise of more than 7% in Nvidia (NVDA) shares and gains in other large tech companies carried stocks higher after a hotter-than-expected inflation report. \nBut early market action on Wednesday has brought a different tone. The Information Technology sector (XLK) is down more than 1%, leading the losses among the 11 sectors.\nMeanwhile, some of the signs of broadening in the market we've highlighted over the past few weeks are back in vogue during early trade. Both the small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 index (^RUT) and the equal-weighted S&P 500 (^SP500EW) are outperforming the traditional market-cap-weighted S&P 500.\nUS stocks took a breather at the open on Wednesday after the S&P 500 wrapped up another all-time high, as investors shrugged off sticky inflation data to focus on fresh economic updates ahead.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down about 0.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) clung to a gain of less than 0.1% on the heels of Tuesday's sharp across-the-board gains. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was off about 0.3%.\nTalk about an under-the-radar move. Blame all the focus on the AI names!\nShares of Nike (NKE) have tanked 7.7% this year, lagging the S&P 500\u2019s 8.5% gain. The bears point to concerns about the pace of sales growth for Nike inside of the sluggish Chinese economy. I have even heard some chatter there could be C-suite changes on deck for this year.\nBut the dreadful quarter from Foot Locker (FL) last week got me to thinking there is a deeper problem with Nike. Maybe it\u2019s not captivating the minds of consumers as it once did, consumers who are aggressively scooping up pairs of On Clouds (Yahoo Finance Live's chat with the company's co-CEOs on Tuesday) from On Holdings (ONON), and Hokas from Decker\u2019s Outdoor (DECK).\nThe Morgan Stanley team seems to be thinking along these lines as well ahead of the company\u2019s March 21 earnings report. Here\u2019s their call-out on Nike\u2019s production innovation:\nWith Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) big 7% reversal on Tuesday (some follow-through this morning), you get the sense traders want to believe recent volatility in the markets is over.\nAnd who knows, maybe they will prove correct.\nBut I do want to remind you that this is a market that \u2014 based on a few measures (RSI Index, etc.) \u2014 is overextended and warranting of a pullback.\nJust check out these two simple stats.\nThe S&P 500 has made 17 record highs this year, the most in any first quarter since 1945. Wow! And then two, the last time the S&P 500 fell more than 5% was in October.\nIt makes my day to see good old-fashioned dividends back en vogue amongst companies (I am not a stock buyback fan).\nCorporate dividends globally reached an all-time high of $1.66 trillion in 2023, according to a new report from Janus Henderson today. That marked a 5% year-over-year increase.\nThe number could be even meatier in 2024 amid the first-ever dividend payouts from Meta (META) and Salesforce (CRM).\nPlaying around with Yahoo Finance data provides a look at some of the cash-rich, well-known companies that are both great dividend payers AND growers.\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 March 1, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA and Celsius Holdings CELH.\nEarnings season continues to wind down, with the bulk of notable companies already delivering quarterly results. The cycle has primarily been positive, underpinned by the Technology sector's strong performance that has uplifted the overall earnings picture.\nAnd throughout the period, there have been several companies delivering results that reflected quarterly records, including Apple, NVIDIA and Celsius Holdings.\nLet's take a closer look at each.\nApple\nMarket-favorite Apple posted quarterly sales of nearly $120 billion and record EPS of $2.18, exceeding our consensus expectations by 1.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Sales grew 2% year-over-year, whereas EPS showed 16% growth.\nStill, EPS wasn't the only quarterly record, as Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and grew 11% from the same period last year. Services revenue has become a nice growth driver for Apple overall, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone.\nIt's worth noting that the reported figure modestly fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate, snapping a streak of recent surprises.\nShares couldn't hold positivity post-earnings, with AAPL shares down nearly 7% YTD and underperforming the S&P 500 by a notable margin.\nNVIDIA \nNVIDIA's quarterly release stole the market spotlight, undoubtedly the most highly-awaited release of the period following an unbelievable growth story stemming from the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe company generated record Q4 revenue of $22.1 billion and posted EPS of $5.16, reflecting remarkable growth rates of 409% and 485%, respectively. Both items exceeded our consensus earnings and revenue expectations, representing beats of 13% and 8%, respectively.\nUnsurprisingly, Data Center results were the real highlight of the release, which include sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA's Data Center raked in a record $18.4 billion throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack and reflecting the unrelenting demand the company has been enjoying.\nThe reported figure blew away our consensus estimate by nearly $1.5 billion, continuing a recent streak of Data Center positivity.\nAnalysts have been revising their earnings expectations higher for the company over the last year, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nCelsius Holdings\nCelsius just delivered its latest batch of quarterly results, with Q4 revenue of $347 million 95% higher than the year-ago period and reflecting a record. Quarterly earnings totaled $0.17 per share, above our consensus estimate and well above the $0.01 per share mark in the same period last year.\nShares have soared following the print, up a sizable 170% just over the last year.\nResults were driven by strength across both International and North American markets, with sales of each growing 97% and 68% year-over-year, respectively. The company continues to win over new customers, also seeing an uptick in consumption occasions.\nEarnings season is slowly grinding to a halt, as the majority of notable companies have already delivered quarterly results. The Q4 cycle turned out to be positive, underpinned by the Technology sector's strong growth.\nAnd throughout the period, several companies, including those above, have posted quarterly records.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Chevron Corp. CVX, Verizon Communications Inc. VZ Eaton Corp. plc ETN, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Ford Motor Co. F.\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Chevron Corp., Verizon Communications Inc. and Eaton Corp. plc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here >>>Shares of Chevron have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-4.6% vs. +0.9%). The Zacks analyst believes based on a number of near-term challenges, Chevron appears to be a risky bet. Over the past year, the energy major has seen its stock price decline more than 10% compared with the S&P 500's increase of 21%.The supermajor \u2013 with 60% liquids-weighted production \u2013 is highly exposed to the perils of oil price fluctuations. The drop in downstream segment earnings as a fallout of lower margins is a concern too while reserve replacement ratio remains weak, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy.Moreover, it has been experiencing an increase in costs as a percentage of revenue. Finally, Chevron has been a laggard compared to its European peers to jump into the clean energy bandwagon. Considering these factors, the company is unlikely to return to favor anytime soon. This calls for a bearish stance on Chevron.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)Verizon's shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+13.3% vs. +7.5%). The company reported healthy fourth-quarter 2023 results, with the top and bottom line beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by significant 5G adoption and wireless traction.It is offering various mix-and-match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans, which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud, security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits. Its mmWave footprint delivers game-changing experiences for the densest parts of the network.However, lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand its customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditures for network upgrade and deployment of fiber assets across the country are headwinds. Muted guidance for 2024 is somewhat worrisome.(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)Shares of Eaton have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry over the past year (+72.1% vs. +41.9%). The company's ongoing research and development are allowing the company to develop new products to provide efficient power management solutions.It will benefit from improving end-market conditions, increasing demand from the new AI data center and contributions from its organic assets. Eaton is expanding via acquisitions and its rising backlog shows demand for its products.
