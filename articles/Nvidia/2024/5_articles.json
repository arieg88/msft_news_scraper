        "Text": "Nvidia stock still has 22% upside, even after its near-doubling this year, according to Goldman Sachs.\nThe bank argued that Nvidia's valuation is still relatively cheap given its fast growth rate.\nGoldman was encouraged by strong spending trends on AI infrastructure by mega-cap tech giants.\nNvidia stock still has plenty of upside even after its year-to-date rally of 81%, according to a Tuesday note from Goldman Sachs.\nThe bank raised its Nvidia price target to $1,100 from $1,000, representing potential upside of 22% from current levels.\nAccording to Goldman, Nvidia stock still trades at a relatively attractive valuation compared to its peers given how quickly it is growing and how durable those growth trends look in the coming years.\n\"We see positive EPS revisions driving another leg up in the stock, especially with NVDA trading at 35x or only a 36% premium to our coverage universe vs. its past 3-year median premium of 160%,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari said.\nHari was specifically encouraged by recent comments from the mega-cap tech giants, which suggested on their earnings call that they will be spending even more money on AI infrastructure in 2025, following an elevated year of investment in 2024.\nThose investments should power continued revenue and profit growth at Nvidia, especially with its next-generation Blackwell AI chip set to be released later this year. Nvidia will report its earnings results on May 22 after the market close.\n\"Notable intra-quarter data points that support the view that AI spending is likely to continue beyond 2024 include\" commentary from tech-focused companies, Hari said.\n1. TSMC reiterated its near- and long-term outlooks for the AI market, and expects server AI processor revenue to more than double year-over-year.\n2. Tier-1 hyperscalers like Amazon and Meta Platforms said or implied that AI-related capital investments are likely to increase in 2025 from an already elevated base in 2024.\n3. Some AI hyperscalers and enterprise software companies highlighted early signs of AI monetization.\n4. AMD raised its 2024 revenue guidance for its AI-focused GPU chip, the Mi300 to $4 billion from $3.5 billion.\n5. Super Micro Computer reported strong revenue growth and a record backlog driven by elevated demand for AI servers.\nAnd while competition is starting to encroach on Nvidia's GPU business via AMD's new chip and in-house chip design from mega-cap tech companies, that won't be enough to knock down the company, according to Hari.\n\"We believe Nvidia will remain the de facto industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive advantage that spans its hardware and software capabilities as well as the installed base and eco-system it has built over multiple decades, and the pace at which it is and will be innovating over the next several years,\" Hari said.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

Consensus estimates (which can be tracked on Yahoo Finance here) are on the rise (again), and the Street remains steadfast in its appetite for jacked-up price targets.\nThe other track is owned and operated by the media, and it is increasingly looking to poke holes in the Nvidia investment thesis. Hey, I get it; it's our job to be skeptical of numbers, commonly held narratives, and leaders.\nBut to be out there peddling that Nvidia's stock is in a bubble because it's up a lot, or its financials may be in a bubble due to eye-popping growth rates, strike me as off base completely.\nLet me offer this up front: I have no car in this race \u2014 do not own shares of Nvidia and never have.\nAll I am saying is that an asset bubble has a few simple characteristics.\nOne: The asset appreciating in value usually doesn't have the fundamentals to justify said appreciation. Two: People are blindly buying the asset without understanding the asset \u2014 mainly because everyone else is going in.\nI don't see either of these things for Nvidia.\nInvestors appear very knowledgeable on Nvidia's business and are buying for the correct reasons.\nThen, Nvidia's growth rates justify a higher valuation. This is a company that just grew earnings by 461% in the first quarter! Sales exploded 262%!\nWhy? Because we are witnessing a seismic shift in tech stacks at the hand of generative AI, powered by models underpinned by Nvidia chips. No one is even close to this company's technology. Concerns over Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) building their own AI chips are great to discuss, but Nvidia is doing this at scale, and is 27 miles ahead of these companies.\n\"People want to deploy these data centers right now,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Dan Howley in an exclusive interview right after earnings (video above). \"They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\"\nWill Nvidia keep growing its top and bottom lines by triple digits? No, but the growth rates will remain beyond impressive and faster than competitors.\nBubble? Let's get real here, people!\nAmazon AWS has begun to make AI chips to better control a supply chain starved for these powerful pieces of technology.

        "Author": "  Aditya Soni, Gokul Pisharody and Lewis Krauskopf ",
        "Text": "By Aditya Soni, Gokul Pisharody and Lewis Krauskopf\n(Reuters) - Shares of Nvidia surged over 9% on Thursday, building on a stunning rally as its bumper revenue forecast reinforced investor confidence in the AI-driven boom in chip demand.\nThe semiconductor bellwether's surge translated to an addition of around $218 billion in market value on the day, according to LSEG data, the second-largest single-day market cap gain in history on Wall Street.\nThe big stock move came even as expectations were high for Nvidia with its shares trading near record peaks in the run-up to earnings. The results also capped a strong quarter for U.S. technology giants, including Microsoft, with AI emerging as a major growth driver.\n\"Companies are continuing to increase their capital expenditures, particularly Big Tech, to keep up with this revolutionary technology, and Nvidia is by far the biggest beneficiary,\" said Josh Gilbert, market analyst at eToro.\nNvidia also unveiled a 10-for-one stock split on Wednesday and lifted its quarterly dividend by 150% as demand continues to exceed supply for its high-end chips that power virtually all AI applications, including OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nAlready the world's third-most valuable firm, Nvidia's market cap gain on Thursday was roughly equivalent to the full value of Adobe. The increase was second only to its own $277 billion jump on the day following its previous earnings report in February.\nNvidia's market cap of $2.55 trillion also was closing in on Apple, the second-largest U.S. company by market value at $2.87 trillion. Microsoft is the largest company by market value, at $3.17 trillion.\nNvidia's shares closed at $1,037.99, ending above the $1,000 level. Its shares are up nearly 110% so far in 2024 after more than tripling last year.\nNvidia's gains on Thursday bucked a broader downswing in the overall stock market. The S&P 500 fell 0.7% on the day, while the other six of the Magnificent Seven tech and growth megacap stocks ended negative.\nThursday's jump also followed a prediction from Taiwanese contract chipmaker TSMC, a major supplier to Nvidia, of 10% annual growth in the global semiconductor industry, excluding memory chips.\nTSMC's U.S.-listed shares ended up 0.6%. However, other AI-focused names were mixed after an initial rally following Nvidia's results. Arm Holdings and Broadcom both rose about 0.1%, while Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer both dropped about 3%.\nAnalysts cheered remarks from Nvidia executives that its new Blackwell AI chips would start shipping in the current quarter and demand for the processors might exceed supply \"well into next year.\"\nCEO Jensen Huang told Reuters that he expected new AI models that are capable of creating video and engaging in human-like voice interactions to spur more orders for Nvidia's processors.\n\"With competition years behind, we believe Nvidia can comfortably defend and maintain its market share,\" said Ido Caspi, research analyst at Global X, which invests in Nvidia.\n\"The ongoing Hopper (Nvidia's current chips) demand should help alleviate investor concerns about customers potentially delaying purchases in anticipation of the Blackwell transition.\"\nAnalysts also said the stock split could make Nvidia more appealing to retail investors after a decline in interest this year.\nAt least 28 of the 58 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, pushing up the median view to $1,200, according to LSEG data.\nNvidia has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 34, compared with AMD's 38 and Super Micro Computer's 26.\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni and Gokul Pisharody in Bengaluru, Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Additional reporting by Siddarth S and Shubham Batra in Bengaluru, Noel Randewich in San Francisco and Danilo Masoni in Milan; Editing by Amanda Cooper, Krishna Chandra Eluri, Anil D'Silva and Marguerita Choy)\n"

        "Text": "We recently covered 7 unstoppable artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy. Let's discuss whether NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the most unstoppable AI stock. The company has been making headlines and popping up on the radars of analysts, hedge funds, and even retail investors on Wall Street Bets. To view the other unstoppable AI stocks, go to 7 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) produces the industry's leading GPUs for AI applications and has been at the forefront of the AI boom. The company's new Blackwell GPU, set to launch by the end of this year, is capable of producing trillion-parameter-scale AI models. The company also directs ample investment to the development of AI software products such as its Advanced AI platform for Enterprise that offers generative AI, data analytics, and inference.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is signing deals with large tech players to push demand for its industry-leading GPUs. On May 21, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a collaboration with Microsoft to facilitate the development and deployment of AI applications. Microsoft Corporation has developed an AI model, the Phi-3 family of small language models, optimized to operate on NVIDIA GPUs. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also offers microservices such as the CuOpt route optimization AI that is added to the Microsoft Azure Marketplace and is part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise Platform. The two companies are also strictly involved in developing a range of optimizations and integrations for developers to create AI applications. These optimizations and integrations will be available in PCs powered by NVIDIA GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nOn May 22, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported strong earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The company reported earnings per share of $6.12, beating estimates by $0.54. The company reported a staggering $26.04 billion in quarterly revenue, up 262% year-over-year and ahead of market consensus by $1.45 billion. The company's data center revenue grew by 23% to reach $22.6 billion, primarily driven by the demand for its Hopper GPU computing platform. Large cloud providers who are customers of NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI infrastructure, accounted for 40% to 50% of data center revenue. Here are some comments from the company's Q1 2025 earnings call:\n\"In Q1, we worked with over 100 customers building AI factories ranging in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs, with some reaching 100,000 GPUs. From a geographic perspective, Data Center revenue continues to diversify as countries around the world invest in Sovereign AI. Sovereign AI refers to a nation\u2019s capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks.\"\nThe comments also reinforced the role of its new Blackwell GPU:\n\"At GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper. The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion parameter scale AI. Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling.\"\nPhoto by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also announced a 10-1 stock split and a dividend hike of 150% on May 22 along with its earnings release. On May 23, Lou Basenese, Public Ventures President and Chief Market Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the stock's performance after its awaited earnings release. The stock is up 90% year-to-date, as of May 23, and has reported strong earnings. The analyst, however, raised concerns about the slim margin by which NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) beat earnings. According to Basenese, the stock beat earnings expectations by 8%, the smallest it has ever been, relative to its 40% beat in the first blowout quarter preceding the AI hype. In response to NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) decision for the stock split, Basenese hinted that the move was great if looked through a psychological lens. He suggests that 40% of trading volume comes from retail investors, and the stock split will eventually push more in retail. He concludes the discussion by highlighting that NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 products are the backbone of AI applications produced by mega-tech companies, meaning the earnings results were quite predictable.\nOn May 23, Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and raised their price target from $1,000 to $1,160. Rosenblatt, on the other hand, maintained a Buy rating on the stock and maintained a price target of $1,400. Over the past three months, 36 Wall Street analysts have held buy-equivalent ratings on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and have an average price target of $1,104. The stock's high forecast of $1,400 represents an upside of 35% from its current price of $1,041.19, as of May 23. According to analysts polled by Yahoo Finance, NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings per share is expected to expand by 94% in 2025, compared to 2024. Despite NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) strong earnings report and a stellar year-to-date performance, the company ranks second on our list of the most unstoppable stocks to buy.

        "Title": "3 Brilliant Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Before Its Stock Split",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) last split its stock in 2021, a 4-for-1 split to reduce its $600 share price to around $150. Now, due to the company's success in the past few years, management has decided it needs another one.\nDuring its last earnings release, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split that will occur on June 10, reducing its $1,000 stock price to $100 per share.\nMany people (including myself) saw this split coming. It will affect some investors who don't have access to fractional shares. In the past, stock-split announcements caused massive run-ups in the weeks leading up to the split. Last time, Nvidia increased by 20% between the split announcement and the effective date.\nIf you're looking to buy Nvidia stock before the split, I have three good reasons why it's a good idea.\nNvidia's primary products are graphics processing units (GPUs), which handle intense computing workloads. Because GPUs process many calculations in parallel, they are great choices for complex tasks like training artificial intelligence (AI) models.\nAI demand has been unprecedented over the past year, driving the stock to new heights. Nvidia recognizes revenue from GPUs used in AI in its data center division, which grew revenue by an astounding 427% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending April 28).\nWhile that's impressive, investors really wanted to see the quarter-over-quarter growth rate -- whether AI demand is growing or shrinking from one quarter to the next. And with revenue rising 23% from the fourth quarter's figure, it's clear that the demand for AI computing power is still growing.\nNvidia doesn't give segment-specific guidance, but second-quarter revenue is expected to be about $28 billion, indicating 107% year-over-year growth and an 8% quarter-over-quarter increase. This appears to be a slowdown, but Nvidia is starting to come up against more difficult comparisons. However, it consistently beat its guidance -- the first-quarter goal was $24 billion while the actual figure was $26 billion.\nNvidia's business isn't slowing down. And it likely won't. According to CEO Jensen Huang, \"The next industrial revolution has begun -- companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center -- AI factories -- to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence.\"\nPart of the reason many have avoided buying the stock despite its success is its valuation. Before announcing first-quarter results, Nvidia traded at 35 times forward earnings. That's cheaper than Microsoft, which trades at 36 times forward earnings, yet Nvidia is growing more rapidly.\nWhen a company is transforming an industry like Nvidia is, it's hard to value a stock because of so many unknowns. With the transformation that AI is bringing and the massive amount of infrastructure needed to execute that change, Nvidia will continue to succeed, and the stock's valuation is a less important factor.\nAnother announcement Nvidia buried in its earnings release was a 150% dividend increase. Before the bump, it paid shareholders $0.04 per share in a quarterly dividend, equating to a 0.016% yield. That essentially made the dividend a nonfactor in owning the stock.\nWith the increase and the stock split, Nvidia will now pay investors a $0.01 per share quarterly dividend, for a 0.04% yield. That's still not anything impressive, but it's the foundation for a much larger payment.\nMany investments are being made to produce the most powerful GPU possible right now. Eventually, this demand will decrease, and Nvidia can increase its dividend to a meaningful amount when it diverts its cash flows to return capital to shareholders.\nFor now, management sees more value in reinvesting its cash flows into the business rather than paying dividends. And so far, it has been right.\nNone of those reasons has anything to do with the stock split itself, but that's on purpose. Stock splits are mostly cosmetic actions and only have consequences if investors cannot access fractional shares or trade options.\nThere are far better reasons to buy Nvidia stock than a split announcement. If you buy now and the stock sees a huge rise due to the announcement, you'll benefit in the short term. But the three reasons I discussed above will be more impactful over the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Long-term investing is one of the keys to sustainable returns in the stock market. This strategy overlooks near-term volatility, giving time for a company's fundamental qualities to shine through. \nWith shares up by almost 20,000% over the previous decade, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is an excellent example of these principles. Let's see if the chipmaker has what it takes to continue beating the market over the next three years. \nIt's hard to imagine a better AI company than Nvidia, the top producer of the graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to train and run these complex algorithms. Business is booming, with fourth-quarter revenue up 265% to $22.1 billion, and profits up 769% to $12.3 billion. \nWhile rivals can sometimes replicate Nvidia's products in raw performance, it protects its position through CUDA, a programming platform and software solution optimized for Nvidia hardware. \nDespite these strong fundamentals, the stock trades for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 37. This valuation is moderately higher than the Nasdaq 100 average of 29 but much cheaper than comparable chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices, which has a P/E of 43 despite growing revenue by only 2% to 5.47 billion in its most recent quarter. Make no mistake about it, Nvidia stock is cheap. \nNvidia's risks don't seem to have much to do with the company itself. The chipmaker has successfully created a moat around its GPUs and has a technological lead over rivals. And it is expanding its addressable market through software and a massive push into custom chips for clients. \nWithin the AI chip market, the company seems to have done everything right. That said, it has become alarmingly overexposed to this one industry. \nIn the fourth quarter, the data center segment (which is dominated by AI GPU sales) generated $18.4 billion, or 83% of total revenue. And the company's gaming segment -- formerly its core -- now barely moves the needle with just $2.8 billion in sales. The worsening lack of diversification makes it uncomfortably vulnerable to changes in the consumer market for AI.\nAs AI-related hype begins to fade over the next three years, companies will have to generate substantial earnings and cash flow to justify the billions they are spending on Nvidia's AI hardware. \nAccording to The Washington Post, AI chatbots like ChatGPT lose money on every query because of the high cost of building and operating large language models (LLMs). \nAnother challenge will come from open-source AI platforms like Elon Musk's Grok, which allows anyone to build projects on its source code for free -- potentially eroding the profit potential in the industry. All this could make it less financially appealing for Nvidia's clients to continue spending so much on its high-priced GPUs. \nWith its high growth rate and reasonable valuation, Nvidia can continue outperforming the market over the next three years. And over the very long term (think decades), the chipmaker's technological lead in GPU design could help it expand to more industries like automaking or virtual reality, which could fix its problem with a lack of diversification. That said, investors who buy the stock now face substantial near-term risks if the AI industry doesn't live up to expectations. \nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Just Announced a Stock Split. Time to Buy?",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "For the past several months, investors have been wondering if Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) would launch a stock split. That's after the technology giant's stock soared in recent years, reaching nearly $1,000. And it actually did reach $1,000 this week in the trading session following Nvidia's earnings report and announcement of a stock split. After the split, the chip designer's shares will be trading at a much lower level.\nBut this move won't change Nvidia's $2.3 trillion market value. Instead, a stock split involves issuing more shares to current shareholders and this will result in more shares trading at a lower price; current shareholders will end up with the same dollar value of stock as they had before the split. The drop in price will make the stock accessible to a broader range of investors, and Nvidia even said as part of its announcement that this was its motivation for making the move.\nSo, today, as Nvidia takes the step many investors were waiting for, is it time to buy the shares?\nIt's important to note that it's not a good idea to buy a stock just because the company launched a split -- it's simply a mechanical operation. A stock split itself won't push a stock's value higher or lower. So now you might ask, if that's the case, why are investors so interested in whether a company will split its stock?\nIn many cases, the move suggests a company is optimistic about its future and believes that its shares have what it takes to take off once again. Generally, the company has performed well from an earnings perspective in recent years, and this has prompted the stock price gains we've already seen. Now, by splitting its shares, a company is implying that those gains aren't over, and from the stock's lower price it once again may soar and even eventually return to its pre-split level.\nNow let's consider the Nvidia operation, a 10-for-1 stock split, effective June 7. This means that if you hold one Nvidia share today, post-split you'll own 10, but the value of your holding will remain the same. And if you buy shares of Nvidia after the split, if they're still trading at $1,000 before the split, they'd drop to $100 per share after the split.\nThis maneuver will make it easier for investors who don't have access to fractional shares or those who prefer buying full shares to invest. And the $1,000 mark represents a psychological barrier for some investors, who would automatically hesitate to buy even if valuation is reasonable. Nvidia's stock split will remove this roadblock and pave the way for them to get in on this tech giant.\nNvidia is no stranger to stock splits, having completed five in the past 24 years. And each time Nvidia announced a split, the stock price was considerably lower than it is today, so I'm not too surprised that Nvidia decided on this move right now.\nLet's get back to our question: Is it time to buy the shares? It is -- but not because of Nvidia's upcoming stock split. Nvidia's shares have climbed after its past stock splits, but this movement is due to the company's increasing revenue and demand for its products.\nAnd a look at Nvidia's recent earnings report and the general AI market offer us reason to be optimistic about the future. The company reported triple-digit growth in revenue and net income in the fiscal 2025 first quarter, with revenue reaching record levels. At the same time, gross margin is on the rise, widening to more than 78%, so Nvidia is becoming more and more profitable.\nThe company says demand for its products and services is surpassing supply, and as Nvidia prepares to launch its new Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever, it's easy to imagine demand remaining strong. Especially considering AI market forecasts. Analysts predict the market will reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade.

        "Author": "  Eric Reed ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA makes computer processors. The company started out, primarily, in the video game and graphic design market. In the late 90's and early 2000's, it was known mainly as a leading company in the relatively niche high-performance gaming industry.\nToday, it is one of the biggest tech companies in the world with a market cap of $2.25 trillion ($NVDA), and it is a main hardware supplier for major emerging technologies such as AI and cryptography. Here's what you need to know.\nThere\u2019s alpha in information. Sign up for the Market Minute newsletter to get summaries of stock market and economic news delivered right to your inbox.\nNVIDIA's core business model is the production of specialized, high-end computer processors. These chips are called \"graphics processor units,\" or GPUs.\nA GPU is a specialized form of processor. It supports the central processing unit, or \"CPU,\" by taking on specific, high-demand tasks as they emerge. This allows your computer to operate normally while also running demanding software because, instead of having to put all other processes on hold, the CPU can hand off single, complicated calculations to the GPU.\u00a0In essence, it\u2019s a difference of breadth vs. depth.\nA central processing chip is built to handle many different tasks at the same time, and its purpose is to run your computer overall. However, as a result, it has fewer resources for any given task. So, for example, the CPU can run the relatively simple calculations of your operating system, web browser and word processor all at once. But it will take a long time to process very complicated demands, which can slow down your computer overall. To do this, the CPU uses a physical architecture known as \u201cserial processing.\u201d\nA graphics processor unit, on the other hand, is built to do one specialized task at a time, and . It can dedicate all of its resources to a single calculation by breaking the task down into smaller, repetitive units, but it cannot handle simultaneous demands. So, for example, a GPU can handle the enormously complicated math of rendering three dimensional images very quickly (historically the most common use case for a GPU), but it would move very slowly if tasked to run four different programs. This is a physical architecture known as \u201cparallel processing.\u201d\nThe name \"graphics processing unit\" comes from the fact that, originally, GPUs were mainly used for graphics rendering in video games. Originally these chips were known as \"ASICs,\" or \"Application Specific Integrated Circuits. During the 1990's and 2000's, video games overwhelmingly drove the demand for high end consumer-level hardware, and GPUs found an early niche in meeting this demand.\nHowever, that is simply an accident of market demand, not a function of hardware limitations. NVIDIA makes sophisticated computer processors designed to supplement core processing and solve specific, high-demand needs. In recent years, demand for specialized computing has grown significantly. These chips are used, among other industries, for blockchain mines, artificial intelligence processing, and data storage and distribution. As a result, demand for NVIDIA's chipsets has grown, and today industry-specific uses such as data centers and AI have surpassed consumer graphics as the core of the company's business model.\nNVIDIA does make a range of additional products beyond the GPU, including laptops, cloud computing, and networking hardware. However the company is overwhelmingly known for their application specific chips, which make up the bulk of their brand and revenue.\nSign up for the Market Minute newsletter for summaries of the latest stock and economic news.\nNVIDIA was founded in 1993.\u00a0The company was an early developer of GPU/ASIC technology, and was one of the first companies to turn these specialized chips into a consumer-oriented product.\nDuring the first 20 years, the company specialized in graphics and gaming. Its core product, GPUs, also became known as \"graphics cards\" and are sold as add-ons for consumer computers. Customers can buy these products and add them to the mainboard of their computers, although to do this you need a desktop computer (rather than a laptop or tablet) and the computer must be capable of accepting modifications (rather than a sealed unit). Only particularly demanding gaming and graphics applications need this kind of hardware, so the consumer base has always been largely limited to hobby computer gamers and graphic artists.\nThis combination of hardware and market limitations make graphics cards a specialty product. During the 90's and 2000's, NVIDIA became the industry standard within this niche. Arguably its only major competitors have historically been AMD and Intel, and even with Intel the company produces built-in graphics processors rather than supplemental hardware.\nFor most of its history, this remained NVIDIA\u2019s position. It has been the gold standard for a specialty product, and in doing so it significantly contributed to semiconductor technology and production techniques used industry-wide.\nNVIDIA IPO\u2019ed in 1999 on the strength of core products such as the RIVA and GeForce processor lines. Starting in the 2000s, NVIDIA became a supplier for video game consoles, including providing the graphics cards for Microsoft's X-Box and Sony's PlayStation. During this era, the company also began branching out into light industry uses, most notably providing graphics chips for automakers' heads-up displays.\nIn the 2010s, NVIDIA saw its business model begin to shift. During this era, entirely new software industries emerged that focused more on single, high-demand tasks. This included blockchain mines, high-volume data storage and distribution, video streaming, and artificial intelligence. This was a change from previous industry emphasis on efficient software that did more with less hardware, and it was an excellent fit for NVIDIA \u2018sspecialty chipsets. This was particularly successful due to the company's CUDA line of products, released in 2006 and built for research-oriented applications.\nSince 2010, NVIDIA's business has moved steadily toward these industry-oriented practices. While the company still produces consumer graphics cards, and arguably remains the industry leader in that field, its main revenue now comes from corporate processor demand. Its biggest customers currently include firms such as OpenAI, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla.\nHowever that success has brought increasing scrutiny from the federal government. In recent years the FTC has increasingly begun looking at NVIDIA's market dominance from an antitrust perspective, which has in turn caused the company to back off from potential acquisitions. htt\nAt time of writing, NVIDIA is one of the most valuable publicly traded stocks in the United States. It had a stock price (NASDAQ: NVDA) of $887 per share and a market cap of $2.22 trillion. By comparison, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) had a share price of $189 and a market cap of $1.97 trillion and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) had a share price of $171 and a market cap of $2.11 trillion.\nNVIDIA has global operations. Its consumer-level business sells chips worldwide, except for jurisdictions in which the U.S. forbids it to do business (in some cases due to national security concerns). It operates offices across North America, South America, Asia and Europe.\nMoney is always in motion.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Robust financial growth with a 262% increase in revenue year-over-year.\nSignificant expansion in Data Center revenue, up 427% from the previous year.\nStrong market positioning with innovative AI and GPU technologies.\nChallenges include supply chain complexities and geopolitical tensions impacting operations.\nOn May 29, 2024, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), a trailblazer in graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerated computing, released its 10-Q filing, showcasing a remarkable financial performance. The company's net income soared to $14.881 billion, a substantial leap from the previous year's $2.043 billion. This financial prowess is underpinned by a staggering 262% year-over-year revenue growth, with Data Center revenue alone climbing by 427%. NVIDIA's gross profit margin impressively stands at 78.4%, reflecting its strong market position and operational efficiency. As we delve into a SWOT analysis of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), these figures provide a solid financial backdrop for understanding the company's strategic positioning.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has cemented its status as a leader in the GPU market, with a significant 262% increase in revenue year-over-year, indicating robust demand for its products. The company's pioneering work in AI and deep learning has expanded its reach beyond traditional gaming, into sectors like data centers, professional visualization, and automotive. NVIDIA's GPUs are not just hardware; they are part of a broader ecosystem that includes CUDA, a software platform for AI development, which further entrenches its market position.\nFinancial Performance: NVIDIA's financial health is a testament to its operational success. With a net income of $14.881 billion and a gross profit margin of 78.4%, the company demonstrates strong profitability and cost management. These financial metrics not only reflect NVIDIA's ability to capitalize on market opportunities but also its resilience in navigating industry challenges.\nProduct Diversification: NVIDIA's strategic expansion into various markets has diversified its revenue streams. The Compute & Networking segment, which includes data center solutions and AI applications, has seen a 427% increase in revenue, underscoring the successful adoption of NVIDIA's technologies in high-growth areas. This diversification reduces reliance on any single market and positions NVIDIA for sustained growth.\nSupply Chain Complexity: NVIDIA's intricate supply chain, involving multiple suppliers and global manufacturing, presents execution risks. The company's reliance on third-party manufacturers and assembly partners, primarily located outside the United States, exposes it to potential disruptions from geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, or pandemics. Managing this complexity is crucial to maintaining product availability and customer satisfaction.\nMarket Concentration Risks: While NVIDIA has diversified its product offerings, it still faces concentration risks. A significant portion of its revenue comes from a limited number of customers and partners. For instance, two direct customers accounted for 24% of total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Losing any of these key customers or changes in their purchasing patterns could adversely impact NVIDIA's financial performance.\nGeopolitical Tensions: NVIDIA's operations and revenue are susceptible to international political dynamics, particularly involving Taiwan and China, where a significant portion of its revenue is generated and where critical supply chain partners are located. Geopolitical tensions in these regions could disrupt NVIDIA's operations and adversely affect its business.\nAI and Deep Learning Expansion: NVIDIA's expertise in AI and deep learning presents significant growth opportunities. The company's GPUs are increasingly used for training and inferencing with large language models and generative AI applications, as evidenced by the 478% growth in Compute GPU revenue. NVIDIA's continued innovation in this space can drive further adoption and open new markets.\nEmerging Technologies: NVIDIA is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and the metaverse. Its platforms are already being used by electric vehicle makers and in AI Cockpit solutions. NVIDIA's early investments in these areas could yield substantial returns as these technologies mature and become more widespread.\nGlobal Market Expansion: With 48% of its revenue from international sales, NVIDIA has ample room to grow its global footprint. Expanding into new geographic markets and strengthening its presence in existing ones can drive further revenue growth and reduce the impact of regional market fluctuations.\nSupply Chain Disruptions: NVIDIA's reliance on a global supply chain makes it vulnerable to disruptions from various sources, including pandemics, natural disasters, and political unrest. These disruptions can lead to extended lead times and supply constraints, impacting the company's ability to meet customer demand and maintain its market position.\nCompetitive Pressure: The GPU and AI markets are highly competitive, with several established players and new entrants vying for market share. NVIDIA must continuously innovate and differentiate its offerings to stay ahead of competitors, which include other tech giants and specialized AI companies.\nRegulatory and Policy Changes: Changes in government policies, particularly concerning trade and technology exports, can pose significant threats to NVIDIA. For example, the company has not received licenses to ship restricted products to China, a key market. Such regulatory challenges can limit NVIDIA's market access and affect its revenue.\nIn conclusion, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) demonstrates a robust financial and strategic position, with significant strengths in market leadership, innovation, and financial performance. However, it must navigate weaknesses such as supply chain complexity and market concentration risks. Opportunities in AI, emerging technologies, and global expansion are promising, while threats from supply chain disruptions, competitive pressure, and regulatory changes require vigilant management. Overall, NVIDIA's strategic initiatives and market foresight position it well to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has caused a paradigm shift in the direction of technology since early last year, and arguably, no company has benefited more than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard when it comes to AI, but some fear the competition is ramping up.\nOne Wall Street analyst thinks investors are missing the forest for the trees.\nGoldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari retained Nvidia on the company's \"Conviction List,\" maintaining his buy rating on the stock and raising his price target to $1,100. That represents potential gains for investors of 22% over the coming year, compared to the stock's closing price on Wednesday. The analyst posits that Nvidia's processors will \"remain the de facto industry standard for the foreseeable future.\"\nThe analyst has a point. Competitors have been trying to take the crown from Nvidia for years, yet its technology is unsurpassed for processing AI. Alphabet unveiled Google's first Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) AI chip in 2015, and Amazon debuted its Inferentia AI chip in 2018.\nDespite those years of competition, Nvidia remains unchallenged. Why? The company spent 20% of its fiscal 2024 revenue on research and development, and its technology is light years ahead of its rivals.\nHari's channel checks suggest \"continued robust AI server demand,\" which will fuel Nvidia's future profitability. As a result, he boosted the company's non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) estimate for fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027 by 8%, on average. Furthermore, the analyst believes his peers have set their profit targets too low, which will drive \"another leg up\" for Nvidia stock.\nIt's good to see one of Wall Street's finest focus on the long term, as that's the real edge we have as investors. Nvidia stock is currently selling for 36 times forward earnings. While some might feel that's a bit pricey, the company's triple-digit sales growth over the past year makes it well worth the slight premium.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has taken the tech world by storm over the last year and a half.\u00a0While OpenAI's ChatGPT sparked the generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom, it's Nvidia that's captured most of the spoils thus far.\nShares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) superstar have jumped 500% since the start of 2023 as revenue and profits have skyrocketed. Nvidia's products comprise the backbone of AI infrastructure, and demand for them has been so strong that there have been shortages of GPUs.\nOn its recent earnings call, Tesla noted that it had installed 35,000 of Nvidia's H100 GPUs in supercomputers. It was the latest sign that Nvidia's hardware is shorthand for AI prowess, as the more of its components a company has, the more AI training and AI inference it can do.\nGiven Nvidia's value in the AI race, it's only natural to wonder who Nvidia's biggest customer is.\nNvidia doesn't disclose who its biggest customer is. That's not surprising since that information would be valuable to competitors. However, in its recent 10-K filing, the company did say that one customer represented 13% of its revenue from its compute and networking segment, and an indirect customer that purchases Nvidia products through integrators and distributors, including the customer above, represents 19% of the company's revenue. This name is also from the compute and networking segment.\nIt's not completely clear who that customer is, but we have a good sense of who Nvidia's biggest customers may be based on media reports and deduction.\nUnsurprisingly, big tech companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Alphabet are believed to be among Nvidia's biggest customers, making up roughly 40% of its revenue.\nIt's also clear that AI start-ups, like OpenAI, and autonomous vehicle companies, like Tesla, are significant customers of Nvidia. At this point, any company investing in AI is almost certainly an Nvidia customer.\nNvidia's customer concentration does add some risk, especially if those big tech companies pulled back on spending, but the greater threat may be incoming competition from AMD and Intel.

A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nNon-GAAP MeasuresTo supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nAbout NVIDIANVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nFor further information, contact:\nSimona JankowskiInvestor RelationsNVIDIA Corporationsjankowski@nvidia.com\nMylene MangalindanCorporate CommunicationsNVIDIA Corporationmmangalindan@nvidia.com\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: companies and countries building AI factories with NVIDIA accelerated computing to produce artificial intelligence; accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform; the expanding reach of generative AI; generative AI expanding to consumer internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive, and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets; NVIDIA being poised for the next wave of growth; the Blackwell platform in full production and forming the foundation for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI; Spectrum-X opening a brand-new market for NVIDIA to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers; NVIDIA NIM as NVIDIA\u2019s new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade, optimized generative AI run on CUDA everywhere \u2014 from the cloud, to on-prem data centers and RTX AI PCs \u2014 through NVIDIA\u2019s expansive network of ecosystem partners; NVIDIA's forward stock split; NVIDIA\u2019s next quarterly cash dividend; gross margins being in the mid-70% range for the full year; full-year operating expenses growing in the low-40% range; and NVIDIA\u2019s financial outlook and expected tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 9.3% on Thursday, closing above $1,000 for the first time and giving the chip giant a market cap north of $2.5 trillion after reporting first quarter earnings that once again blew away forecasts.\nNvidia's first quarter results, released after the bell on Wednesday, showed adjusted earnings per share (EPS) tallied $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, a jump of 461% and 262%, respectively, from a year ago.\nThe company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split and an increased dividend, following some of its Big Tech peers in doling out heftier quarterly payments to shareholders.\nAnalysts were expecting adjusted EPS of $5.65 on revenue of $24.69 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. The company reported adjusted EPS of $1.09 on revenue of $7.19 billion in the same quarter last year.\nIn the current quarter, Nvidia expects revenue of $28 billion, plus or minus 2%. That\u2019s better than the $26.6 billion analysts had expected.\n\u201cOur data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. \"Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\"\nWall Street analysts have previously raised concerns about the share of Nvidia's Data Center revenue that comes from hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and other Big Tech names. That's especially true as those companies roll out their own AI accelerator chips.\nIn an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance following the company's earnings report on Wednesday, Huang pushed back against concerns the company could face a demand lull as it shifts between its current and next generation of AI chips.\n\"People want to deploy these data centers right now,\" Huang said. \"They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\"\nNvidia's Data Center revenue jumped 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion. CFO Colette Kress said in a statement on Wednesday that large cloud providers accounted for around 45% of the company's Data Center revenue.\nIn a note to clients published Thursday, JPMorgan analysts led by Harlan Sur wrote Nvidia, \"continues to maintain a 1-2 step lead ahead of competitors.\" JPMorgan raised its price target on Nvidia stock to $1,150 from $850 and reiterated an Overweight rating on shares.\nOn the company's earnings call, Kress pointed out that revenue out of China was down significantly in the quarter, as the company was forced to halt shipments of its most powerful chips to the country. The company also expects the market in the region to remain very competitive going forward.\nThe company's stock split \u2014 in which shareholders will receive 10 shares for every one share of the company they currently own \u2014 will be effective June 7, and its new dividend will be paid June 28 to shareholders as of June 11.\nThe stock split will likely fuel speculation Nvidia could be added to the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), joining Big Tech peers like Apple (AAPL), Amazon, and Microsoft.\nNvidia's beefed-up dividend also follows similar moves announced so far this year from the likes of Meta (META) and Alphabet, which both initiated quarterly dividends for the first time, and Apple, which raised its dividend earlier this month.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": "  Rachel Christian ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA), the semiconductor tech giant at the heart of the AI boom, announced plans for a stock split Tuesday, May 22 that could make shares cheaper for investors. Nvidia says it will split its stock 10-1 effective June 7.\nEach Nvidia stockholder at market close on Thursday, June 6 will receive nine additional shares that will be distributed after the close of market on Friday, June 7, according to the company.\nAfter a blockbuster earnings report, NVDA jumped 7.4 percent to $1,020 a share when the market opened May 23.\nNvidia says it\u2019s splitting its stock to make \u201cownership more accessible to employees and investors,\u201d according to the company\u2019s earnings call May 22.\nWhile fractional share investing is common at many online brokers, a lower share price often generates excitement and can put ownership within reach for many small retail investors.\nFor example, a 10-1 stock split of Nvidia trading at $1,020 per share would bring the price down to $102 per share.\nA stock split occurs when a company divides its existing shares into multiple new shares. It\u2019s like cutting a pizza into more slices \u2014 the total amount of pizza remains the same, but you have more slices to distribute.\nA lower share price can seem more affordable, even though the total investment to own the same proportional stake remains the same. It can also boost liquidity since more shares can lead to more frequent trading.\nFor existing shareholders, a stock split doesn\u2019t change the total value of their holdings. They simply own more shares at a lower price per share. It won\u2019t make them richer or poorer overnight. Current shareholders will still enjoy the same overall dividend payouts and the same voting rights.\nTo avoid confusion with actual stock value, data providers adjust past prices for splits by making them proportionally lower, reflecting the extra shares investors received.\nStock splits often serve as a trust signal to investors from company leadership. It indicates that management believes the company\u2019s future is bright and the stock price will continue to rise, even after the split lowers the price.\nAnother promising sign for investors: The company raised its dividend 150 percent, from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share.\nNvidia is no stranger to stock splits. The company has undergone five since launching its IPO in 1999, most recently about three years ago in 2021. An investor who bought a single share of NVDA 25 years ago would have about 48 shares of the company today.\nHere\u2019s a look at Nvidia\u2019s previous splits:\nJuly 20, 2021: 4-1 split\nSept. 11, 2007: 3-2 split\nApril 7, 2006: 2-1 split\nSept. 12, 2001:\u00a0 2-1 split\nJune 27, 2000:\u00a0 2-1 split\nStock splits are not as common as they used to be, but they still happen. Recent examples include Amazon and Alphabet (parent company of Google) in 2022, and Walmart in 2024.\nNvidia was founded over 30 years ago in 1993, but it only became a household name over the last two years with the rise of AI technology. It became a trillion-dollar company in June 2023 \u2014 joining just five other companies \u2014 as investors bought into the artificial intelligence boom.\nNvidia designs advanced chips that are used in AI systems and its shares are up about 116 percent in 2024 as of May 23, 2024. It ended 2023 up a remarkable 246 percent from the start of the year. Nvidia generated $26 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2024 alone, up 18 percent from the previous quarter.\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision.

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has crushed the broader market handsomely over the past five years with eye-popping gains of more than 1,800% -- which is significantly higher than the S&P 500 index's gains of 71% -- and a big reason behind the chip giant's terrific surge is its dominant position in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\nHowever, can Nvidia sustain its AI-driven growth for the next five years and deliver more gains to investors? Let's find out.\nAllied Market Research estimates that the global AI chip market was worth just under $15 billion in 2022. However, by 2032, the market research firm expects sales of AI chips to generate annual revenue of nearly $384 billion. Nvidia is in the driver's seat in this space, controlling an estimated 94% of the AI chip market last year, per Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho Securities.\nNvidia's first-mover advantage in AI chips has paid off handsomely for the company. Its graphics cards have been extremely popular and deployed by major cloud computing providers and start-ups to train AI models, including ChatGPT. As a result, Nvidia's data center revenue has been growing at a stunning rate. In fiscal 2024, which ended on Jan. 28, 2024, the company reported data center revenue of $47.5 billion, up a massive 217% from the previous year.\nNvidia, however, is expected to cede some ground in the AI chip market to rivals. Rakesh, for instance, expects the company's AI chip share to slip to 75% over the next couple of years as the likes of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) bring competitive offerings into the market. AMD witnessed an 80% year-over-year increase in sales of its data center chips in the first quarter of 2024 to $2.3 billion, thanks to the growing demand for its AI accelerators.\nThe Nvidia competitor expects to sell $4 billion worth of AI graphics cards this year, which is double its initial estimate of $2 billion. Analysts, however, expect AMD to end the year with as much as $8 billion in revenue from sales of AI-focused data center chips.\nIntel management also pointed out on the company's latest earnings conference call that its new Gaudi 3 data center accelerators are gaining traction and could generate $500 million in revenue in the second half of 2024, followed by a stronger showing next year. Nvidia, however, is expected to be in a league of its own.\nAccording to market research firm Omdia, the chipmaker could sell $87 billion worth of data center graphics cards this year. That would be a huge jump from the $34 billion the company generated through data center chip sales last year. Even better, Rakesh forecasts Nvidia could sell $280 billion worth of data center graphics cards in 2027 despite the potential loss in market share. That's not surprising, considering how fast this space is growing.\nIn simple words, there is enough room for Nvidia to grow in the AI chip market even if the competition gets stronger. Throw in the potential growth the company could witness in other markets, such as gaming, it is easy to see why analysts expect Nvidia to clock healthy earnings growth for the next five years.\nConsensus estimates predict Nvidia's earnings will increase at an annual rate of just over 35% for the next five years. Based on the company's fiscal 2024 earnings of $12.96 per share, its bottom line could jump to $58.11 per share after five years, assuming it does increase at the predicted rate.\nThe good part is that the company seems capable of delivering the growth that analysts are expecting from it based on the points discussed above and Nvidia's commanding pricing power in the AI chip space. Not surprisingly, analysts bumped up Nvidia's earnings estimates significantly for the current and the next two fiscal years, as seen in the chart below.\nAs such, there is a good chance that Nvidia's earnings could indeed touch the projected $58.11 per share after five years. Multiplying the projected earnings with Nvidia's five-year average forward earnings multiple of 39 suggests that its stock price could hit $2,266 per share (barring any stock splits or other events) after five years. That would translate into a jump of 162% from current levels.\nSo, investors who haven't bought this AI stock yet can still consider doing so, as its impressive rally seems sustainable over the next five years.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Right Now (and 1 Reason to Sell)",
        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If you want to bet on generative artificial intelligence (AI), there is still no better pick than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company dominates the market for cutting-edge AI data center chips. And unsurprisingly, shares have risen by a whopping 206% over the last 12 months alone. But can the bull run continue? Let's look at three reasons to continue buying Nvidia stock and one reason why it might be time to sell. \nWhile Nvidia's parabolic stock price surge may look like a bubble, it isn't. The rally is justified by equally impressive operational results. Fourth-quarter revenue surged 265% year over year to a record of $22.1 billion, driven by sales of cutting-edge AI hardware. Profitability is also exploding, with net income jumping almost ninefold to $12.3 billion. \nNvidia is enjoying a windfall from selling graphics processing units (GPUs) like the h200, which data center clients use to train and run their AI algorithms. This hardware is remarkably expensive, with the h100 costing as much as $30,000 per chip. The strong demand and pricing power allowed Nvidia to boast a software-like gross margin of 76% -- up from 63.3% in the prior-year period. \nNvidia's astronomical margins are catching the attention of rivals like Advanced Micro Devices, which want to compete for a slice of the AI chip market, and customers like Alphabet or Amazon, aiming to reduce their reliance on third-party hardware by creating in-house custom chips. However, Nvidia is positioned to handle both long-term threats. \nNvidia stays ahead of the competition through constant innovation and a faster product update cycle. While rivals are trying to match its current flagship, the h100, Nvidia is already launching its replacement, the h200, which features more memory and faster algorithm training speeds. \nThe company is also tackling the $30 billion custom chip opportunity with a new segment designed to help clients build AI chips specialized for specific use cases. Nvidia's scale and design expertise could help it make custom chips more efficiently than its clients could do themselves. \nWith spectacular top and bottom-line growth coupled with a deep economic moat, Nvidia sounds like a company that deserves massive premium valuation. However, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 38, shares are only moderately higher than the Nasdaq-100 average of 33. And this looks like a shockingly good deal. So, why exactly is Nvidia stock still so cheap? There is one big risk. \nWhile there are plenty of reasons for investors to buy Nvidia stock, there is one big reason to be more cautious: The AI market might not live up to expectations. According to the Washington Post, AI chatbots lose money with every customer search because of their high operating costs. And it is still unclear how companies plan to monetize them. \nAs the producer of picks and shovels in this \"gold rush,\" Nvidia is currently shielded from the lack of profitability in consumer-facing AI applications. However, if companies keep losing money on AI, they may eventually scale back their spending on Nvidia's hardware. This challenge is likely the most daunting headwind Nvidia faces. But the good news is that its current valuation seems to already price in a possible slowdown.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Ryan Vanzo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It should come as no surprise that Jensen Huang is the largest individual shareholder of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). He co-founded the company with friends back in 1993 and currently serves as its president and CEO.\nHuang's total stake in Nvidia currently stands at 86,827,600 shares, worth a cool $82.8 billion as of this writing. But who owns the second most shares?\nWhen it comes to current management, CFO Colette Kress owns the second most Nvidia stock. Her 643,148 shares are worth around $613 million. Ajay Puri, the company's executive vice president of worldwide field operations, owns 532,401 shares. That stake is valued at $508 million.\nBut outside of the executive team, billionaire venture capitalist Mark Stevens comes out on top. He served as a company director from 1993 to 2006 and has been\u00a0 a member of the board since 2008. His 4,069,181 shares are worth about $3.9 billion.\nBut these aren't Nvidia's largest shareholders if you expand the scope to institutional investors. Roughly two-thirds of the company is held by institutions, versus around 4.3% held by company insiders.\nUnsurprisingly, Vanguard Group and BlackRock come out on top with a combined stake of around 400 million shares. That's roughly 15% of the entire company. These two entities are two of the largest money managers in the world, however. Both operate dozens of multibillion-dollar index funds, so their holdings aren't necessarily a pure bet on Nvidia as a stand-alone stock. The top eight funds invested in Nvidia stock are all index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nWhat happened to Nvidia's other co-founders? One of them, Curtis Priem, gave away most of his shares long ago, meaning he didn't directly benefit from the company's recent meteoric rise. His stake would now be worth $70 billion if he hadn't donated the bulk of it back in the early 2000s.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "This year is shaping up to be a record-breaking one for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors as shares of the semiconductor giant have already shot up more than 91%, and there is a good chance that the stock's rally could get a nice shot in the arm once Nvidia reports its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on Wednesday, May 22.\nNvidia is heading into its next quarterly report riding on favorable developments within the artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor market, which can help it crush Wall Street's expectations. KeyBanc analyst John Vinh predicts Nvidia will deliver $5.81 per share in Q1 earnings on revenue of $25.6 billion. That's higher than the consensus expectations of $5.57 per share in earnings and $24.6 billion in revenue.\nVinh's forecast also exceeds Nvidia's revenue guidance of $24 billion, and it won't be surprising to see the company match the KeyBanc analyst's expectations considering its immense pricing power and dominant share in the AI chip market. Those are precisely the reasons why Vinh forecasts a serious acceleration in Nvidia's growth in the current quarter and the second half of the year.\nWhile Vinh points out that the solid demand for the company's current-generation Hopper AI chips will allow it to beat Wall Street's fiscal first-quarter expectations and also deliver better-than-expected guidance, he also claims that the next-generation AI chips from Nvidia are set to drive some serious growth for the company.\nNvidia's new Blackwell chips are expected to hit the market in the third quarter of 2024. Vinh estimates that the new B100 and B200 processors, which will replace Nvidia's current top-of-the-line offerings, could command 40% higher average selling prices (ASPs) than their predecessors.\nAs Nvidia ramps up the production of its Blackwell chips in 2025 and starts shipping the GB200 Superchip -- which combines two Nvidia B200 GPUs (graphics processing units) with its Grace server CPU (central processing unit) -- the company could pull in a massive $200 billion in data center revenue in 2025 (which will coincide with its fiscal 2026).\nThat would be a huge jump from the $47.5 billion in revenue that Nvidia generated in fiscal 2024 and the $87 billion it is expected to generate from AI chip sales this year (fiscal 2025). The company's terrific pricing power in AI chips could drive such massive acceleration in Nvidia's data center sales. According to HSBC, the company is expected to price its entry-level B100 GPU between $30,000 and $35,000. However, the GB200 Superchip could command a price in the range of $60,000 to $70,000.\nWhat's more, Nvidia's server systems equipped with multiple CPUs and GPUs are estimated to command prices between $1.8 million and $3 million on average. It is worth noting that Nvidia management pointed out on the company's February earnings conference call that it expects its \"next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply.\"\nSo, despite a potential increase in pricing, the demand for Nvidia's new chips is likely to remain robust. That is a testament to the company's solid pricing power, as well as its ability to continue maintaining a solid share of the AI chip market. TechInsights estimates that Nvidia's market share of the AI GPU market increased to 97% in 2023 from 96% in 2022.\nTherefore, the company seems set to benefit from a combination of higher AI chip sales and improved pricing over the next couple of years, which is probably the reason why analysts have been raising their growth expectations for the company.\nA closer look at the chart below tells us that Nvidia's earnings estimates have been heading higher of late.\nMore specifically, the company's bottom line could jump 52% in a couple of fiscal years from this year's projected $25.27 per share to $38.30 per share in fiscal 2027. However, if Nvidia's next-generation AI chips indeed hit gold, the company could end up delivering much stronger earnings growth.\nThe stock is currently trading at 38 times forward earnings, just below its five-year average. Investors, therefore, are getting a relatively good deal on Nvidia stock right now, and they should consider buying it since its red-hot rally seems here to stay thanks to the catalysts discussed above.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders are pricing in a big move for Nvidia\u2019s shares after the chipmaker reports earnings on Wednesday, though expectations for volatility are more muted than in the past, U.S. options markets show.\nNvidia's options are primed for an 8.7% swing in either direction by Friday, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert. That would translate to a market cap swing of $200 billion - larger than the market capitalization for about 90% of S&P 500 companies.\nWhile massive by most measures, that implied move would fall far short of the 16.4% jump Nvidia\u2019s shares notched after the company\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings report. It is also less aggressive than the average 12% move traders had priced for the last eight quarters.\n\"Volatility and expectations had been a fair amount higher the last time around,\" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.\nNvidia, up about 87% this year, is seen as a bellwether of the burgeoning AI industry and has a market value of about $2.3 trillion, making it the third-largest company on Wall Street, behind Microsoft and Apple. Wall Street is betting on a blowout quarterly report from Nvidia.\nInvestor interest has spread out to other beneficiaries of the AI theme in recent months.\n\"AI benefits are broadening out to power, commodities and utilities,\" BofA strategists including Gonzalo Asis wrote in a note on Monday. \"It's not just about NVDA anymore.\"\nBofA\u2019s strategists expect the company to drive 9% of the S&P 500 earnings growth over the next 12 months, compared to 37% over the last 12 months.\nThat\u2019s not to say the upcoming earnings report is expected to be uneventful for the company\u2019s share price.\nMatt Amberson, founder of options analytics service ORATS, noted that implied volatility for out of the money calls is roughly equal to that of out of the money puts. That suggests options traders are not writing off the possibility of more upside for the stock, despite its already-hefty year-to-date gains.\n\"Traders expect up moves to be as violent as down moves,\" Amberson said.\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $5.59 a share, and a rise in quarterly revenue to $24.65 billion from $7.19 billion a year ago, according to LSEG data.\nSteve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said a downturn in Nvidia could test investors\u2019 resolve regarding the broader AI trade.\n\"Yes, the rally has broadened out, but I'm not sure how sturdy it would be if Nvidia sold off hard,\" he said.\n\"There is a lot riding on the AI trade,\" Sosnick said.\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Lincoln Feast.)\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) recently gave investors more evidence that the surge in demand for its data center products powering artificial intelligence (AI) applications has more legs. That helped persuade Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann to continue to recommend investors buy the stock.\nHis firm's $1,400 price target for Nvidia stock remains one of the highest on Wall Street. That represents upside of about 34% even after Nvidia shares popped following its fiscal 2025 first-quarter results. Nvidia shares have now more than doubled in 2024.\nThe strength in Nvidia's AI business hasn't been a secret for investors. Expectations have been high, but the company continues to surpass Wall Street's, and its own, estimates. Consider that the three months ended April 28 marked the fourth straight quarter in which the company beat its own revenue guidance by at least $2 billion.\nYear over year revenue by business segment increased as follows:\nData center: 427%\nGaming: 18%\nOminverse: 45%\nAutomotive and robotics: 11%\nWhile the company is growing all areas, its data center AI business is what's driving the stock right now. Mosesmann thinks that will continue, with the company outperforming expectations as Nvidia projects another meaningful jump in sales in the current fiscal quarter.\nSome investors thought near-term demand would wane as customers wait for the more powerful Blackwell architecture. But clearly that hasn't happened, and Blackwell shipments are expected to begin before the end of this year. In the earnings release, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang commented, \"We are poised for our next wave of growth. The Blackwell platform is in full production.\"\nThe runway for growth in AI spending looks to be a long one. And Nvidia continues to innovate in other areas as well. The company wants to offer more and more value to customers.

        "Title": "Here's Why Nvidia Is Still My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have skyrocketed in recent times, climbing 130% this year and more than 600% over the past three years. All of this is due to Nvidia's shift from a company serving primarily the video game industry to one that's critical to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) platforms.\nThe tech giant makes graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that traditionally have powered the speed and special effects involved in gaming -- and today these chips also are powering crucial AI tasks such as the training and inferencing of AI models. This has helped Nvidia's earnings to soar in the triple digits in recent quarters.\nSome investors worry about buying Nvidia stock today, though, considering its major gains -- and the fact that rivals are attempting to grab market share. But I think there's still plenty of room for Nvidia to advance from an earnings and a share performance perspective, and that's why it's still my top AI stock. Let's check out the details.\nFirst, we'll get started with a bit of background. It's important to understand why Nvidia is dominating the chip market. The company has the advantage of being first to market with its GPUs, but there's more to the picture than that. Nvidia's GPUs also happen to be the fastest, making them the gold standard for potential customers setting up an AI platform.\nAnd Nvidia didn't just stop at the GPU. The company offers a wide range of products and services, including an entire software platform for enterprises, that helps customers hit the ground running with their AI projects. Finally, Nvidia has made its wares available through all public cloud services, making it very easy for potential customers to access what Nvidia has to offer.\nNow, moving forward, I'm optimistic about Nvidia remaining ahead of the game, which will translate into more earnings growth and positive share price performance. There are two main reasons. The primary one has to do with Nvidia's focus on research and development. The company has set a goal of updating its GPUs on an annual basis, and if it meets that goal, it could very well always have the top-performing chip on the market.\nFor example, Intel recently said its new Gaudi 3 AI accelerator could outperform Nvidia's current top performer, the H100. However, Nvidia is in the process of launching an even more advanced chip, the H200, and later this year, Nvidia aims to release a whole new architecture called Blackwell, and its best-performing chip yet. This suggests that rivals may catch up with Nvidia's current top performer, but Nvidia likely will have another even better product ready to hit the market shortly thereafter.\nSecond, right now, we're in the early stages of AI development, with the market set to grow beyond $1 trillion later this decade, according to analysts' forecasts. In this environment, Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang is working on leading this development. An example is Huang's championing of sovereign AI, or the ability of countries to use their own data and infrastructure to create AI -- an AI tailored to their needs.\nHuang spoke of the importance of this earlier in the year at the World Governments Summit in Dubai. And in Nvidia's recent earnings report, the company said it's beginning to generate revenue from sales of AI products and services for sovereign AI. It even predicts that its sovereign AI revenue -- from nothing last year -- may reach \"the high single-digit billions\" this year. So Nvidia is leading the way when it comes to finding new streams of AI revenue.\nNow let's talk about valuation, the point that may lead investors to turn to a cheaper rival like Intel. Nvidia trades for 42 times forward earnings estimates, while Intel trades for only 27. Intel is a solid deal at these levels, and I would buy the stock for its potential to gain some AI market share and excel in its plans to open its chip manufacturing up to others.\nBut my top AI stock to own over time still is Nvidia for the reasons I've mentioned above, and these reasons make the stock well worth today's price. Yes, Nvidia has soared in recent years, but that doesn't mean the opportunity for gains is over -- if companies continue to develop AI projects as rapidly as in the recent past, Nvidia, and its investors, should continue to reap the rewards over time.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock just keeps rising. Today's jump of about 7% as of 1 p.m. ET wasn't due to any new information from the company. Nvidia released its quarterly earnings last week and the stock jumped on that news.\nBut today's move -- and the reason why Nvidia shares can keep moving higher -- comes from another company's announcement today. Nvidia's sales have been soaring, and now investors see another multibillion-dollar customer coming in Elon Musk's xAI.\nNvidia's stock took off when it started monetizing sales of its processors used for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Sales of its GPUs continue to rise, with the company saying its sees revenue more than doubling in the current quarter compared to the year-ago period.\nThose sales are going to a wide range of technology companies building AI large language models and vastly increasing computing power. Last year, the top customers for Nvidia's GPU offering included many well-known companies.\nBut while one Elon Musk company (Tesla) was on that list, another just announced it raised a fresh $6 billion in capital. And many expect much of the funds xAI just raised to be spent on Nvidia's processing chips.\nxAI is Musk's start-up working to develop artificial intelligence. It just announced a new funding round this weekend that raised $6 billion and values the private company at about $24 billion, according to Musk. Reports have indicated that xAI plans to build a supercomputer to power a new version of xAI's chatbot named Grok. xAI may partner with Oracle using what could be tens of thousands of Nvidia chips.\nWith xAI not even making the top dozen customers for Nvidia's H100 GPUs in 2023, the news is making investors bullish that the backlog of demand for Nvidia's AI chips has a long tail.

        "Title": "History Says an Nvidia Stock-Split Announcement Might Be Coming on May 22",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has risen to become a nearly $1,000 stock again, which is usually a threshold where investors start to expect a stock split. While there's no hard and fast rule about when to expect a split (some companies never do), history tells us that Nvidia could be considering one now.\nAdditionally, May 22 may be the day that one is announced, which is right around the corner. The last time Nvidia announced a stock split, the stock went wild and rose significantly. So, should you buy ahead of this potential announcement?\nThe last time Nvidia enacted a stock split was on July 20, 2021. That four-for-one split broke each Nvidia share into four separate pieces, thus increasing the share count fourfold and cutting the stock price to 25% of its original value. Without this split, Nvidia's stock would be around $3,600 today.\nHowever, the timing of this last split announcement sets the stage for a potential announcement on May 22 during its first-quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings release. In its Q1 fiscal year 2022 earnings release (which occurred on May 26, 2021), Nvidia announced to shareholders that the board of directors agreed to split the stock. This is perfect timing, as the annual meeting of stockholders was set to occur only a few weeks later so that shareholders could approve the vote. At that time, Nvidia was trading at around $600, so the stock is far more expensive today than when it decided to split its stock.\nWith the stage set for nearly the same scenario three years later, I would not be surprised if Nvidia announced a stock split on May 22. The question is, will it ignite a run-up like it did last time? After Nvidia's Q1 results were announced, up until the stock split date, the stock went on an impressive tear.\nWith the stock rising 30% in the days after the stock-split announcement, who wouldn't want to get ahead of that movement? However, investors should not expect that kind of reaction again.\nShould Nvidia's stock increase by 30% from current levels, its market cap would increase from $2.3 trillion to roughly $3 trillion. That would allow Nvidia to surpass Apple as the second-largest company in the world and put it within striking distance of Microsoft as the largest company in the world.\nI doubt that a stock-split announcement will create nearly $700 billion in value. Fortunately, there are other reasons to buy the stock.\nWhile the threshold where companies split their stocks differs for each business, the reason remains the same: Their stock price has gotten too expensive. This occurs because the business is succeeding -- a great problem to have.\nNvidia's business has been on fire lately, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) selling at an unbelievable pace to satisfy the demand for data centers built to power the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race.\nAny stock movement from a potential stock-split announcement should be attributed to its GPU business, as it's the driving force behind the stock. With management guiding investors for Q1 revenue of about $24 billion (indicating 234% growth), we're slated to see a monster quarter reported again.\nWhile a stock-split announcement may be coming, investors should look beyond that to determine if Nvidia is a potential buy (or not).\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The stock now has a weighting of over 5% in the S&P 500, while accounting for 6.5% of the Nasdaq 100 and 20% of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF.\n\"If they do well ... there are going to be a lot of stocks that ride its coattails,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \"It's very rare you have one stock that can have such a dramatic impact on the overall market. But Nvidia has earned that.\"\nNvidia\u2019s results come as the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average have all notched record highs this month after a turbulent April, boosted by a strong earnings season and renewed hopes that the U.S. economy is headed for a so-called soft landing.\nRobust earnings from Nvidia could complement well-received reports from other U.S. megacap companies such as Microsoft and Alphabet, helping justify stock market valuations that have grown stretched in recent months. The S&P 500 trades at 20.8 times forward earnings, compared with a historical average of 15.7, according to LSEG Datastream.\nNvidia's presence in AI means \"what they report can have a pretty significant bearing on a perception of the major investment theme that's out there right now,\" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services. AI is \"touching every single area, and the nexus of all that is Nvidia,\" he said.\nNvidia's fiscal first-quarter results are due after the market closes on Wednesday. The earnings could impact the share prices of AI-related companies - some of which have stumbled in recent weeks after massive runs.\nSuper Micro Computer, Advanced Micro Devices, Arm Holdings and Palantir Technologies are among the stocks that sold off following their results this period. Those stocks all are off at least 20% from their 52-week highs.\nNvidia, by contrast, was recently about 2% from its all-time intraday high ahead of its report. The company's quarterly revenue is expected to roughly triple to $24.6 billion, according to LSEG.\n\"The bar is high,\" said Bryant VanCronkhite, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. \"Investors are being very demanding right now, and I don\u2019t see why Nvidia wouldn\u2019t have the same hurdle rates that these other companies have had.\"\nBIG SWINGS\nNvidia's blockbuster results a year ago - when the company projected quarterly revenue more than 50% above Wall Street estimates - helped accelerate the market\u2019s excitement for all things AI. The company\u2019s stock rose 24% the following day.\nThis time around, bets in options markets imply an 8.6% move in Nvidia\u2019s shares in either direction by Friday, Trade Alert data showed. That would translate to a market cap swing of $200 billion - larger than the market capitalization for about 90% of S&P 500 companies.\nTo be sure, Nvidia's surging share price means the company must meet a high bar to support its stock. For example, some investors may be looking for the company to report particularly powerful revenue and project it to be robust going forward.\n\"As great and as sure as things seem right now for Nvidia, the revenues are still very volatile and I think fairly highly unpredictable,\" said Matt Benkendorf, chief investment officer at Vontobel Quality Growth.\nHowever, Nvidia's valuation has moderated even as the shares have soared as analysts rapidly raised their expectations for the company's expected profit. The stock was recently trading at about 34 times forward 12 months earnings estimates, down from over 80 times in the middle of last year, according to LSEG Datastream.\n\u201cUnlike some of the AI-driven names ... it\u2019s actually been driven primarily by fundamentals,\u201d said Deepon Nag, portfolio manager of large cap value strategy at ClearBridge Investments.\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Additional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Text": "Top AI chip supplier Nvidia reports fiscal first-quarter results Wednesday after the market closes, with Wall Street anticipating some deceleration following its earlier blockbuster growth.\nStill, for the quarter that ended in April, the numbers will be explosive as its chips remain in high demand for data centers used in generative artificial intelligence.\nAnalysts polled by FactSet see earnings per share soaring 474% to $5.22, with revenue up 241% to $24.5 billion. That would be down from the prior quarter's 765% earnings jump and 265% revenue surge.\nMeanwhile, the stock has leapt 87% so far in 2024 and is up about 200% from a year ago. Nvidia is now the third most valuable company in the world, boasting a market cap of $2.3 trillion that trails only Apple and Microsoft. But shares have essentially been flat over the last two months.\nNvidia\u2019s unveiling in March of its new Blackwell chip has prompted some analysts to expect a slowdown during the transition from its older H100 chips to the next-generation models, which are expected to become publicly available later this year.\nIn a note on Thursday, analysts at Bank of America flagged this deceleration as a potential source of volatility in Nvidia stock after the earnings come out.\nWhile BofA sees Nvidia reporting strong numbers compared with the Wall Street consensus, analysts expect the company's second-quarter guidance to mark the first time sequential growth will be less than 10%.\nMeanwhile, it sees gross margins shrinking from about 77% in the first quarter to a \"more normalized\" range of 75%-76% in the following quarter.\n\"However, even if NVDA were to potentially deliver on these bullish expectations, the stock could still react unfavorably as bears will likely complain that: 1) NVDA QoQ sales growth will decelerate to 'only' 7-8% QoQ in FQ2 (Jul) outlook, well below the mid-teens or better the last few quarters, 2) [gross margin] peaking and decline is a sign of pricing pressure, unfavorable mix (more China H20 shipments and/or more inference units) and slowing demand/easing supply,\" the note said.\nFor its part, BofA is upbeat on Nvidia, giving the stock a \"buy\" rating and a price target of $1,100, which suggests upside of 19% from Friday's close.\nLast month, analysts at Morgan Stanley were also bullish on Nvidia, saying there were no signs of a pause in growth during the transition to the Blackwell chip with underlying demand still strong.\n\u201cNVDA continues to see strong spending trends in AI, with upward revisions in demand from some of the newer customers such as Tesla and various sovereigns,\u201d analysts wrote.\nAnd despite rising competition from Intel, Huawei, Samsung, and others, Morgan Stanley expects Nvidia to maintain its market share.\n\u201cBlackwell generation pricing looks to make a strong competitive statement\u2014reducing enthusiasm for competitive offerings,\u201d it added.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "With its latest earnings report, AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a ten-for-one stock split. The split, which will be distributed at the close on June 7th, will give shareholders ten shares in exchange for each one share they own as of the June 6th record date. The stock will start trading split-adjusted at market open on Monday, June 10th. The split raises the very real possibility that NVIDIA will be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), with chip-laggard Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) seen as the company it will likely replace.\nThe Dow is a price a price-weighted index, meaning stocks with higher prices have a bigger impact on the index. With NVIDIA\u2019s stock over $1000 per share currently, this would give it too much of a weighting in the index. However, with the ten-for-one split, the stock price would be closer to the $100 level \u2013 making an entry into the Dow more feasible and likely.\nThe last change for the Dow was in August 2020, when Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) replaced ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE).\nWhen asked to comment on speculation that NVIDIA will soon be added to the Dow, S&P Dow Jones Indices, the firm behind the index, said it does not comment or speculate on index additions or deletions.\nHowever, reading the DJIA methodology language carefully hints that NVIDIA will, in fact, be added, and the announcement can come at any time.\nIt reads: \u201cWhile stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Since the indexes are price weighted, the Index Committee evaluates stock price when considering a company for inclusion. The Index Committee monitors whether the highest-priced stock in the index has a price more than 10 times that of the lowest. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the index is also a consideration in the selection process for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Companies should be incorporated and headquartered in the U.S., and a plurality of revenues should be derived from the U.S. Changes to the indices are made on an as-needed basis. There is no annual or semi-annual reconstitution. Rather, changes in response to corporate actions and market developments can be made at any time. Constituent changes are typically announced one to five days before they are scheduled to be implemented. At any given time, the constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Dow Jones Transportation Average and Dow Jones Utility Average make up the Dow Jones Composite Average.\u201d (bolded by Investing.com)\nNVIDIA is the third-largest company in the world, with a market value of $2.7 trillion\u2014behind only Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a market value of just over $3 trillion, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has a market value of $2.9 trillion. Apple and Microsoft are both in the Dow.\nIt is the leader in AI, powering applications like ChatGPT, which is expected to be bigger than the Internet.\nNVIDIA now dwarfs the once-mighty Intel, which has a market cap of only $128 billion. Intel is the lowest-priced stock in the Dow, and its market cap is near the bottom of the list.\nNVIDIA is expected to post revenue of $111.38 billion this year versus $52 billion for Intel. NVIDIA\u2019s growth is also astonishing versus Intel\u2019s lack of growth. NVIDIA\u2019s revenue is expected to grow by 83% this year, while Intel\u2019s is expected to fall by 5%.\nThe inclusion of NVIDIA in the Dow will also be an admission by the DJIA Index Committee that AI is the future of all industries, not just technology.\nRelated Articles\nNVIDIA is a shoo-in for the Dow post stock split\nBoston Beer reportedly in sale talks to Suntory: WSJ\nUS lawmakers ask FBI for briefing on GenScript Biotech's links to China\n"

        "Title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before Wednesday?",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the undisputed beneficiary of recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). Since early last year, the adoption of AI has spread like wildfire, fueled by Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). The company will face a key hurdle when it reports its first-quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday, and Wall Street will be sitting on the edge of its seat to parse the results.\nThe stock has gained an incredible 548% since the start of last year (as of this writing), fueled by strong and accelerating demand for AI. Nvidia has been the unofficial standard bearer of the AI revolution, but investors are beginning to wonder if the trend can continue at its recent breakneck pace.\nWith the scene set, should investors buy Nvidia stock before its highly anticipated first-quarter report? Let's examine the available evidence.\nThe initial excitement has worn off in recent months and investors are no longer taking the AI revolution on faith. Yet, the major cloud services have been vocal about the ongoing demand for generative AI and their plans to boost investment in the space.\nMicrosoft increased its capital expenditures by 79% to $14 billion in the calendar first quarter, while Alphabet's spending grew by 90% to $12 billion. Amazon spent $14 billion in the first quarter, which it expects will be the low point of spending for the year, expecting capex spending to \"meaningfully increase\" thanks to AI.\nSince data centers and cloud infrastructure providers are among Nvidia's largest customers, that would seem to bode well for the company's upcoming report.\nFor its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 30), analysts expect Nvidia's sales to surge 277% to $24.6 billion, with earnings per share (EPS) jumping from $0.83 to $4.57.\nWhile results of that magnitude might seem unlikely, consider this: in the fourth quarter, Nvidia generated record revenue that jumped 265% to $22.1 billion, and its outlook is calling for Q1 revenue of $24 billion -- and its guidance tends to be conservative.\nSeveral AI-centric companies have reported results in recent weeks, and the market's reaction has been puzzling, to say the least.\nEarlier this month, AI software and data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) reported first-quarter revenue that grew 21% year over year and 4% sequentially to $634 million, while its adjusted EPS jumped 60%. Wall Street found its guidance lacking, however, and the stock fell 15% on the day following its report.\nFor its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended March 31), chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) reported revenue that grew 47% year over year to $928 million, while adjusted EPS of $0.36 soared 1,700% (not a typo). Despite the surge in both sales and profits, investors were hoping for more robust guidance, and the stock fell 2% following the release of its results.\nFor its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), AI-centric server maker Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) delivered record revenue that jumped 200% year over year to $3.85 billion, while adjusted EPS soared 308% to $6.65. Despite raising its guidance, Wall Street wanted more, and the stock tumbled 14% on the day following its report.\nEagle-eyed investors will have noticed a pattern emerging. Despite strong, expectation-beating results, Wall Street is looking to the future and taking a wait-and-see approach.\nThese results suggest that while demand for AI remains high, investors are not only demanding stellar results but looking for robust guidance to confirm that the secular tailwinds of AI continue to blow.\nHow you answer this question depends on what type of investor you are. For those looking to buy ownership in a business with a strong track record of execution, savvy management, and technological tailwinds, and have plans to hold it for the long term, then Nvidia might just be the stock for you.\nIf, however, you're looking to jump into the stock before earnings in the hopes that it will pop so you can make a quick exit, then Nvidia might end up being a disappointment. Truth be told, there's simply no way to know for sure whether Nvidia stock will go up or down after it reports on Wednesday.\nIf I were to hazard a guess, I'm inclined to think that investors continue to underestimate the continuing strong deman for AI and the fundamental changes it will bring to the fore. That said, unless Nvidia significantly boosts its guidance, the stock could tumble.\nThat said, Nvidia has shown a knack for skating to where the puck is going rather than where it's been. The company continues to spend heavily on research and development, which amounted to 20% of its 2023 revenue. Nvidia is already working on the next generation of industry-leading AI processors, which is how it stays so far ahead of the competition.\nFinally, there's the matter of Nvidia's valuation. At 79 times trailing 12-month earnings, the stock might seem exorbitantly expensive if not for three consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, with another likely on the way. However, Nvidia is selling for 38 times next year's earnings, and while that's a bit on the high side, it's justified by the company's meteoric growth.\nHowever, for those looking beyond the current quarter, I believe Nvidia's track record and history of innovations speak for itself, making it a buy for investors intending to hold for years if not decades.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is on fire. Shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader have gained 81.5% so far in 2024, and are up 531% over the last three years through May 10. The S&P 500 index has returned 10% and 31.9%, respectively, over these periods.\nThe stock's gains are mostly being driven by powerful demand for the company's AI-enabling graphics processing units (GPUs) and related offerings for data centers. Nvidia has an estimated 80% share of the fast-growing market for data center AI chips.\nBut can Nvidia stock's great performance continue? Some investors are concerned the company could be hurt by the increasing trend among large technology companies, nearly all of which are Nvidia customers, of developing their own custom AI chips. They are doing so to optimize the chips to their specific AI workloads, which can have monetary and power advantages over using general processors, such as GPUs.\nThere's some good news for Nvidia investors on this front.\nNvidia is forming a new business unit focused on designing custom chips for cloud computing companies and others to use for data center AI and other applications, according to a Reuters' exclusive article published in February. The article named Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Marvell Technology executive, as head of Nvidia's new custom chip business. (Custom chips are also called application-specific integrated circuit, or ASIC, chips.)\nThe Reuters article cited \"nine sources familiar with the company's plans.\" Moreover, it indicated that McKinney's title on her LinkedIn profile, which reportedly had indicated she was heading Nvidia's custom chip business, was changed after Reuters contacted Nvidia for comment. The latter alone gives much credence to the reporting, in my view.\nThat said, I wanted to dig a bit before covering this topic. My perusal of Nvidia's job openings supports the theory that it's building a custom chip unit. Moreover, I found a LinkedIn post from McKinney, indicating she was excited to join Nvidia in her new role heading the custom silicon team.\nThe three big tech companies that are leaders in the cloud computing service market -- Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft -- now have or will soon have custom AI chips. The companies use (or plan to use) these chips for internal reasons and they are (or will soon be) available on their cloud services.\nAlphabet was the first mover in this space. In 2015, it began using its tensor processing units (TPUs) for internal purposes and several years later made them available for customers of Google Cloud. In 2018, Amazon released its first version of its custom AI chip Graviton, which is available on Amazon Web Services (AWS). And last November, Microsoft unveiled two custom-designed chips, Maia and Cobalt.\nAs you might expect, Facebook parent Meta Platforms has also designed its own custom AI chip, the Meta training and inference accelerator (MTIA). Apple and Tesla also have custom chips. Apple uses custom silicon for its various consumer electronic products, while Tesla started using a custom-designed chip several years ago in its self-driving feature.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is the biggest name in the custom AI chip business. There's much confidentiality in this space, but it's known that Broadcom's custom AI chip customers include Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Moreover, at an investor event in March, Broadcom disclosed that it had gained a third big custom AI chip customer, but it did not name the company.\nResearch firm 650 Group's Alan Weckel estimated the data center custom chip market will be worth about $10 billion this year, and surge to $25 billion in 2025, according to the Reuter's exclusive. That article also cited a Needham analyst who covers the semiconductor space as pegging the broader custom chip market at approximately $30 billion in 2023.\nOn May 22, Nvidia is due to report its results for the fiscal first quarter, which ended in late April. Management has guided for quarterly revenue of $24 million. If we use this number as an estimate and multiply it by four, Nvidia's annual revenue run rate comes out to about $96 million.\nIf we assume the data center AI chip market will be worth about $25 million by 2025 and the broader custom chip market was worth $30 million last year, as estimated by 650 Group, it's clear that the custom chip market is substantial even for a company as massive as Nvidia.\nIt seems extremely likely that Nvidia will enter the custom chip market for AI and other applications. The company has expertise across GPUs, central processing units (CPUs), data processing units (DPUs), and high-performance networking technologies. It makes good sense for it to leverage its extensive intellectual property (IP) to capture some of the already large and fast-growing custom chip market.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Results in the fiscal first quarter, which ended April 28, also beat projections \u2014 lifted by growth in Nvidia\u2019s data-center division.\nThe big question heading into the earnings report was whether Nvidia\u2019s latest numbers could justify the dizzying run-up in its stock. The shares had gained 92% this year through Wednesday\u2019s close, fueled by investor hopes that the company would continue to shatter expectations.\nThe report didn\u2019t disappoint, and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang stoked the excitement by talking about the dawning of a new era. \u201cThis is the beginning of a new industrial revolution,\u201d he said in an interview, echoing one of his favorite themes. \u201cThis is really exciting.\u201d\nRead More: Five Charts Showing Nvidia\u2019s Jaw-Dropping Rise to Chip Stardom\nThe shares rose 9.3% to $1,037.99 on Thursday, adding nearly $220 billion to Nvidia\u2019s valuation. That\u2019s far more than the entire market capitalization of Intel Corp., a chipmaker that once dwarfed Nvidia by every measure. And Nvidia\u2019s $28 billion in projected quarterly sales would be more than twice what Intel is expected to report.\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split and boosted its quarterly dividend by 150% to 10 cents a share. The rally helped lift the shares of other companies associated with AI. Super Micro Computer Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. rose in the wake of the results, though a broader market retreat pared the gains on Thursday.\nThe upbeat outlook reinforces Nvidia\u2019s status as the biggest beneficiary of AI spending. The company\u2019s so-called AI accelerators \u2014 chips that help data centers develop chatbots and other cutting-edge tools \u2014 have become a hot commodity in the past two years, sending its sales soaring. Nvidia\u2019s market valuation has skyrocketed as well, topping $2.5 trillion.\nIn the fiscal first quarter, Nvidia\u2019s revenue more than tripled to $26 billion. Excluding certain items, profit was $6.12 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $24.7 billion and earnings of $5.65 a share.\nHuang, in his signature black leather jacket, has become a celebrity in the AI era. His company, which he co-founded in 1993, started as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. But he recognized that Nvidia\u2019s chips were well-suited to developing AI software and that helped open a new market \u2014 and gave him a jump on competitors.\nThe release of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT chatbot in 2022 then sparked a race between major technology companies to build their own AI infrastructure. The scramble made Nvidia\u2019s H100 accelerators a must-have product. They sell for tens of thousands of dollars per chip and are often in scarce supply.\nFor now, much of this new revenue comes from a small handful of customers. A group of four companies \u2014 Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google \u2014 are Nvidia\u2019s largest buyers and have accounted for about 40% of sales. Huang, 61, is trying to spread his bets by producing complete computers, software and services \u2014 aimed at helping more corporations and government agencies deploy their own AI systems.\nNvidia\u2019s data-center division \u2014 now by far its largest source of sales \u2014 generated $22.6 billion of revenue last quarter. Gaming chips provided $2.6 billion. Analysts had given targets of $21 billion for the data-center unit and $2.6 billion for gaming.\nNvidia emphasized Wednesday that it wants to sell its technology to a wider market \u2014 expanding beyond the giant cloud-computing providers known as hyperscalers. Huang said that AI is moving to consumer internet companies, carmakers, biotechnology and health-care customers. Countries also are developing their own systems \u2014 a trend referred to as sovereign AI.\nThese opportunities are creating multiple multibillion-dollar markets beyond cloud service providers, he said.\nThe large-scale deployment of Nvidia chips by Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Inc. is one sign of that expansion. The automaker is using Nvidia gear to develop software that will operate self-driving vehicles.\nStill, hyperscalers remained a critical growth driver for Nvidia last quarter. They generated approximately 45% of the company\u2019s data-center revenue. That suggests Nvidia is in the early stages of diversifying the business.\nThe company\u2019s new chip platform, called Blackwell, is now in full production, Huang said. And it lays the groundwork for generative AI that can handle trillions of parameters. \u201cWe are poised for our next wave of growth,\u201d he said.\nThe company will get \u201ca lot\u201d of its 2024 revenue from the new Blackwell chips, Huang said. But customers aren\u2019t easing up on orders for its existing products \u2014 a concern among some analysts.

It was last valued at $2.92 trillion.\n\"It is certainly notable because Apple has been so dominant for so long, especially on the growth and innovation front. Recently though, Apple's innovation curve seems to have flattened, showing slower future growth,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.\n\"On the other hand, Nvidia has been able to catch wave upon wave of growth. Beginning with gaming demand, then crypto and now AI, they have been able to perfectly match innovation with demand and that equals explosive growth.\"\nThe semiconductor company is heavily weighted on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq and has been pivotal in driving U.S. stocks to record highs. It accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500's gains this year.\nNvidia also became the fastest company to grow from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in 2024, zooming past Amazon.com, Google-parent Alphabet and Saudi Aramco.\nSince its blowout forecast about a year ago, the company has consistently breezed past Wall Street's lofty expectations for revenue and profit, with demand for its graphic processors far outstripping supply as Big Tech rushes to embed AI applications.\nSharp increases in analysts' earnings estimates have resulted in a fall in the stock's forward earnings valuation, even with the share price racing higher.\nIt traded at 37 times forward earnings, compared with 48 times earnings a year ago, LSEG data showed.\nNvidia is also popular in the derivatives market. GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF, which tracks twice the daily percentage change in Nvidia, is the largest single stock ETF.\nThe fund clocked $1 billion in daily turnover for the first time ahead of Nvidia's results last week and its total net assets have hit a record $2.82 billion this week, according to Lipper data.\nOptions traders are bullish as Nvidia's volumes, particularly for calls, has picked up in recent sessions after the surge in its stock price.\nThursday marked the fifth straight session where more than a million Nvidia call options changed hands, the longest such streak in the stock's history, according to a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data.\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York)\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia overtakes Qualcomm to become the biggest chip designer by revenue, which should give Jensen plenty to smile about",
        "Author": "  Andy Edser ",
        "Text": "It may have escaped your notice, but word on the street is that Nvidia is doing rather well of late. Fourth quarter earnings released earlier this year revealed gigantic revenue and net income figures thanks to surging AI demand, and now a recent report from Trendforce shows that the company has overtaken Qualcomm to become the biggest chip designer by revenue, too.\nThe figures show that Nvidia raked in $55.268 billion in revenue in 2023, in contrast to the second biggest chip designer, Qualcomm, which managed $30.913 billion over the same period. That puts Nvidia firmly at the top of the table, beating out Broadcom, AMD, Mediatek and others by a substantial margin and leaving the company at an estimated market share of 33%, up 15% over the previous year.\nNotable by their absence in these figures are Intel and Samsung, as the list doesn't seem to include chip makers with their own fabrication facilities. Presumably Intel will appear once the switch to its \"internal foundry model\" is complete, splitting the fabrication and design departments in the process.\nStill, these figures are sure to put a smile on the face of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has been busy announcing next-generation Blackwell AI GPUs that already seem to be flying off the racks, \u00a0and has even occasionally found the time to drop off the odd unit in person.\nNvidia is said to now have captured over 80% of the AI accelerator market thanks to strong sales of its H100 AI GPU, with revenue growth predicted to continue to rise into 2024 thanks to the new Blackwell chips. AMD's revenue meanwhile fell by 4% to $22.68 billion last year, with the slight stumble attributed to sluggish PC demand and inventory reduction.\nWhile Nvidia appears to top the charts for now, it'll be interesting to see if Qualcomm can pull some of that lead back with sales of consumer chips. The company is said to be actively promoting the automotive market, and expects revenues in that sector to more than double by 2030.\nAs for AMD, its AI GPU MI300 series is expected to be a major revenue driver in 2024. Recent financial statements released by the company have shown that server CPU sales, alongside heavily increased AI GPU revenue, have both led to large financial gains in the first quarter of this year, although its gaming division appears to be struggling.\nHaving a strong foothold in AI hardware seems to have done wonders for Nvidia's figures, and certainly bodes well for continued revenue in the coming months. The company seems to have been raking in the gains, and with these sorts of earnings and a sustained AI demand that seems to show no signs of slowing, it's difficult to imagine any of its competitors knocking it off the top spot for a long while to come.\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.NVIDIA\u2019s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company\u2019s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.NVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company\u2019s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company\u2019s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.Santa Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024, up 126% from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023.Beginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments \u2013 Graphics and Compute & Networking.Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.Compute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.Graphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 22% and 78% of fiscal 2024 revenues, respectively.\nBottom Line\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Nvidia ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2014 would be worth $230,327.74, or a gain of 22,932.77%, as of May 27, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\nThe S&P 500 rose 179.12% and the price of gold increased 77.20% over the same time frame in comparison.\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for NVDA.\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. Shares of the company have outperformed the industry over the past year. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\nShares have gained 21.35% over the past four weeks and there have been 6 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Microsoft will offer clusters of MI300X chips through its Azure cloud computing service as an alternative to Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) H100 graphic processing units (GPUs).\nGiven this announcement, is it time to dump Nvidia stock in favor of AMD?\nThe simple answer is no. Expanding on that answer, it might be a good time to buy both stocks -- and another beneficiary as well.\nMicrosoft isn't offering cloud customers the option of AMD GPUs as a knock on Nvidia's GPUs, which have become the industry standard for helping power AI applications in the data center. The issue is that Nvidia's chips are so popular that it is becoming difficult for companies to get hold of them. This isn't a bad problem to have.\nBoth Nvidia and AMD are having difficulty keeping up with demand for their GPUs. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, said that its advanced packaging capacity is fully booked for both the rest of this year and next. It's presumed this is due to demand for GPUs from both Nvidia and AMD, which are both top-10 customers of the company.\nTSCM is working to aggressively expand its production capacity to meet AI and other high-performance computing (HPC) chip demand. The company now plans to build a third fabrication facility (fab) in Arizona after its first facility in the state just began wafer production. It also just completed its first specialty technology fab in Japan and announced a second in the country to be completed by the end of 2027. It is also building a fab in Germany for automotive and industrial applications, scheduled to start construction late this year.\nTSMC is also looking to fully develop its 2-nanometer chip technology. Within the semiconductor industry, as technology moves to smaller nodes (semiconductor sizes), more chips can fit on a wafer, which increases production capacity and lowers costs.\nHowever, until this technology and fab expansion take hold, the market for GPUs looks like it will remain tight.\nInstead of dumping Nvidia, now could be a great time for investors to buy both Nvidia and AMD stock, as well as TSMC. The demand for high-performance computing chips and GPUs is massive, and the industry is currently struggling to meet demand.\nNvidia remains the clear leader, and its growth has been nothing short of spectacular. The company long ago became the GPU industry standard before the advent of AI through its CUDA software platform, which allows its GPUs to be programmed directly. At this point, the company can likely sell as many chips as its foundry partners can produce. These days most semiconductor companies don't own their own manufacturing facilities, and instead use contract manufacturers like TSCM.\nAMD, meanwhile, is a nice beneficiary of a very tight GPU market. With its Q1 results, the company just raised its expected full-year data center GPU revenue from $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion. And with Nvidia GPUs difficult to get, AMD has the opportunity to make inroads into this market and become a viable number-two player. Companies generally don't like to rely too heavily on one supplier, so the current market dynamics could give AMD a longer-lasting boost if its chips are well received.\nTSCM, meanwhile, is a prime beneficiary of GPU and chip demand, as companies race to get these chips to power AI applications. By adding additional fabs and moving to 2-nanometer technology, TSCM is set to benefit from the AI chip boom. It also will benefit as other companies jump on board. For example, it has been reported that Arm Holdings and Softbank have been looking to design an AI chip, while companies like Amazon have gotten into the AI chip business as well. Apple executives, meanwhile, have been reported to have met with TSMC to reserve 2-nanometer production to help it catch up in AI. This all benefits TSMC.\nWhen looking at valuations, TSMC is the cheapest stock, trading at about 24 times forward P/E. It is even cheaper on an enterprise value-to-EBITDA basis, trading near 13 times. This metric takes into consideration its net debt position and takes out non-cash expenses.\nNvidia, meanwhile, trades at a forward P/E of 37, and 32 on an EV/EBITDA basis. Given its growth, this is an inexpensive valuation.\nAMD is the most expensive stock of the group, trading at a forward P/E of over 47 and an EV/EBITDA multiple of over 50. However, the company has not yet seen the potential AI chip inflection point that the other two companies have, so it still holds potential.\nIn order of preference at this time, Nvidia would be my first choice, closely followed by TSMC, and then AMD. However, all three stocks hold strong long-term potential.\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  DAVID HAMILTON ",
        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Nvidia on Wednesday overshot Wall Street estimates as its profit skyrocketed, bolstered by the chipmaking dominance that has made the company an icon of the artificial intelligence boom.\nIts net income rose more than sevenfold compared to a year earlier, jumping to $14.88 billion in its first quarter that ended April 28 from $2.04 billion a year earlier. Revenue more than tripled, rising to $26.04 billion from $7.19 billion in the previous year.\n\u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun,\u201d CEO Jensen Huang declared on a conference call with analysts. Huang predicted that the companies snapping up Nvidia chips will use them to build a new type of data centers he called \u201cAI factories\u201d designed to produce \u201ca new commodity \u2014 artificial intelligence.\u201d\nHuang added that training AI models is becoming a faster process as they learn to become \u201cmultimodal\u201d \u2014 that is, capable of understanding text, speech, images, video and 3-D data \u2014 and also \u201cto reason and plan.\u201d\nThe company reported earnings per share \u2014 adjusted to exclude one-time items \u2014 of $6.12, well above the $5.60 that Wall Street analysts had expected, according to FactSet. It also announced a 10-for-1 stock split, a move that it noted will make its shares more accessible to employees and investors.\nAnd it increased its dividend to 10 cents a share from 4 cents.\nShares in Nvidia Corp. rose 6% in after-hours trading to $1,006.89. The stock has risen more than 200% in the past year.\nThe company, based in Santa Clara, California, carved out an early lead in the hardware and software needed to tailor its technology to AI applications, partly because founder and CEO Jensen Huang began to nudge the company into what was then seen as a still half-baked technology more than a decade ago. It also makes chips for gaming and cars.\nThe company now boasts the third highest market value on Wall Street, behind only Microsoft and Apple.\n\u201cNvidia defies gravity again,\u201d Jacob Bourne, an analyst with Emarketer, said of the quarterly report. While many tech companies are eager to reduce their dependence on Nvidia, which has achieved a level of hardware dominance in AI rivaling that of earlier computing pioneers such as Intel Corp., \u201cthey\u2019re not quite there yet,\u201d he added.\nDemand for generative AI systems that can compose documents, make images and serve as increasingly lifelike personal assistants has fueled astronomical sales of Nvidia\u2019s specialized AI chips over the past year. Tech giants Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have all signaled they will need to spend more in coming months on the chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.\nWhat happens after that could be another matter. Some analysts believe the breakneck race to build those huge data centers will eventually peak, potentially spelling trouble for Nvidia in the aftermath.\n\u201cThe biggest question that remains is how long this runway is,\u201d Third Bridge analyst Lucas Keh wrote in a research note. AI workloads in the cloud will eventually shift from training to inference, or the more everyday task of processing fresh data using already trained AI systems, he noted. And inference doesn't require the level of power provided by Nvidia's expensive top-of-the-line chips, which will open up market opportunities for chipmakers offering less powerful, but also less costly, alternatives.\nWhen that happens, Keh wrote, \u201cNvidia's dominant market share position will be tested.\u201d\n"

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Before May 22 (and 1 Reason to Sell)",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If you're an Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or any type of artificial intelligence (AI) investor, then May 22 is a day you must have circled on your calendar. That's when Nvidia reports Q1 FY 2025 results, which will give investors some clues as to how strong the market is for Nvidia's class-leading GPUs (graphics processing units).\nWith how big of a move Nvidia's stock has made after previous earnings releases, it may be wise to consider buying (or selling) some shares before then. I've analyzed Nvidia and come up with three reasons to buy and one to sell. So what should you do before May 22?\nNvidia's primary product, the GPU, is vital for AI model development and training. GPUs allow parallel processing, giving them the ability to do multiple tasks at the same time. This is crucial for training AI models, as multiple iterations must occur before an AI model is usable.\nNvidia's GPUs are the best on the market for AI training, and its customers are buying thousands of them at a time to outfit their servers with the best technology possible.\nThis caused Nvidia's initial boom last year, but some investors (including myself) were worried that there would be little demand for more capacity once initial demand is satisfied. However, that isn't the case.\nMeta Platforms raised its long-term capital expenditure guidance to build more computing power to capture the massive AI opportunity it sees. On its conference call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mentioned that they have about 35,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs active, with another 85,000 slated to be up and running by the end of this year.\nThe demand for Nvidia's products is still there, which should bode well for it this quarter.\nOne gripe about Nvidia's stock has been how expensive it is. That's true if you look at the trailing-price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. At 76 times earnings, it could be considered outrageously expensive. But that doesn't do the stock justice. Nvidia is undergoing a massive transformation and is expected to post another massive quarter of growth (Wall Street projects 250% growth in Q1).\nAs a result, looking at trailing earnings does investors no good. Instead,they should utilize the forward P/E to value Nvidia.\nAt 36 times forward earnings estimates, Nvidia is far from cheap. However, it's undergoing a massive shift, and this figure could be incredibly off the mark if Nvidia's growth continues. Furthermore, it's not far off from Microsoft, which trades at 35 times forward earnings despite growing much slower.\nIf valuation is a top reason to avoid Nvidia's stock, you may need to rethink that, as many other stocks trade in a similar range as Nvidia despite not having the growth.\nAlthough Nvidia may have some of the best products on the market, it isn't resting on its laurels. Nvidia has launched a few new upgraded GPUs, like the Blackwell GPU. But what investors (and many companies) are waiting for is the H200.\nThis system is expected to launch in the second quarter of 2024 and is a massive upgrade over the already popular H100. Some companies may be holding out until the H200 is launched to future-proof their servers, as they don't want to upgrade in a couple of years when the H100s become obsolete.\nAlthough that's speculation, the H200 will undoubtedly drive new demand, especially from companies willing to pay top dollar to have the best products available.\nThese are great reasons to buy Nvidia's stock before its Q1 earnings date, but there's also a reason to sell.\nWhile I mentioned that Nvidia's stock isn't as expensive as many think, it's still priced for perfection. If Nvidia misses the mark in any way this quarter, there will likely be a heavy sell-off.\nI think that's unlikely because the heavy demand for Nvidia's GPUs is still present. However, the company's execution is unknown until investors see the financials.\nShould Nvidia report a less-than-perfect quarter, investors must examine the situation more closely to determine whether the sell-off is warranted or a buying opportunity.\nAlthough the odds of this happening are pretty low, something as simple as a slip-up or a tone on a conference call can make or break a stock.\nWith how the industry currently looks, I see no problem with buying Nvidia's stock before Q1 results, as it's slated to be another quarter of incredibly strong growth.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Artificial intelligence enthusiasm has been spreading across the stock market.\nWednesday night's Nvidia (NVDA) earnings call will mark a year since the chipmaker first shocked Wall Street with its demand for AI chips. Since then, mentions of AI have skyrocketed on earnings calls, growing 186% since the first quarter of 2023, per Bank of America Research.\nThis comes as the conversation around AI has quickly moved from AI chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) to AI power users like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT). More recently, strategists have highlighted a broadening out to other sectors that could benefit from the increased power usage, like Energy (XLE), Utilities (XLU), and Commodities.\n\"It's not just about NVDA anymore,\" Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\nThis shift has already been underway in the market. Several precious metals, including copper (HG=F), which strategists have said will benefit from AI spend, have hit recent highs. The Utilities and Energy sectors are two of the top-performing sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) this year, up about 15% and 13%, respectively.\nThis has trickled down to individual names that are now rivaling the meteoric stock rise of Nvidia since the start of 2024. Texas-based Vistra Corp (VST) is up roughly 140% this year, while Constellation Energy (CEG) shares have risen nearly 90%, which is about in line with Nvidia's rise this year.\nIn a note on Sunday, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson listed Utilities as an Overweight sector, noting it offers \"upside to the AI power theme.\" Wilson highlighted that the Power and Utilities team at Morgan Stanley believes electricity could rise from 3% of total US consumption in 2023 to about 10% by 2030, driven by new AI data centers that are 50 times the size of previous ones.\n\"Both traditional and alternative energy providers have upside revisions potential amid the increasing need for AI data center power and more favorable data center power deals,\" Wilson wrote.\nAnd companies have been playing up their role in the AI buildout too.\nResearch from Goldman Sachs' equity strategy team led by David Kostin shows mentions of AI soared in the first quarter. More than 66% of companies in the Energy sector mentioned AI during their earnings calls this quarter, up from 19.1% last quarter.\nGiven the big-picture implications, investors will be closely watching Nvidia's report for color on AI chip demand.\nThus far, Nvidia has repeatedly surprised investors on this front, continuously topping analyst expectations for quarterly results and boosting its outlook for the coming quarter amid robust demand for its AI servers.\nWhether this trend holds or breaks could now have repercussions for a variety of sectors.\n\"If markets wake up to say, 'Hey, maybe we got a little bit too excited about this and maybe we pulled forward some of these earnings just a little bit,' and that's reflected in those valuations,\"' JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist Jack Manley told Yahoo Finance, \"that's where I think you have the potential for a bit of a shaky road.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) could be one of the most valuable opportunities in history for investors, and the semiconductor industry is at the heart of it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang believes there is a whopping $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure that must be upgraded with new chips to support demand from AI developers.\nNvidia is leading the charge right now, but it won't be the only beneficiary of that opportunity. However, rather than trying to pick which stocks might be the winners and losers over the long term, investors should consider buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) instead.\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) is a specialized fund that invests exclusively in the world's top chip companies, and Nvidia is its largest holding.\nThe SOXX ETF delivered a spectacular compound annual return of 30.4% over the last five years. That's almost triple the yearly return in the S&P 500 index over the same period.\nIn fact, the SOXX ETF recently soared to $680 per share, which made it somewhat inaccessible to smaller investors. As a result, iShares executed a 3-for-1 stock split in March, which increased the number of SOXX shares in circulation threefold, bringing its stock price down by two-thirds organically. It had no impact on the underlying value of the ETF, but it means investors can now buy in for as little as $217 (as of this writing).\nConsidering the substantial AI opportunity ahead for the chip sector, the momentum in the SOXX ETF will likely continue long into the future. Here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million in 10 years -- but don't fret, investors with any amount of starting capital can benefit from a fivefold return if this opportunity pans out.\nNvidia designs some of the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI workloads. They are fitted inside centralized data centers operated by tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon, which in turn sell the computing power to developers so they can build, train, and deploy their AI models.\nNvidia's industry-leading H100 GPU drove the company's data center revenue to a year-over-year increase of 217% in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28) to $47.5 billion. That piece of hardware is the primary reason Nvidia is now a $2.2 trillion company -- and considering the new, more advanced H200 GPU is now shipping, the momentum will likely continue.\nThe SOXX ETF owns stakes in 30 different chip companies, but it's heavily weighted toward its top five holdings, which account for 35.4% of the total value of its portfolio:\nStock\nSOXX ETF Weighting\n1. Nvidia\n8.88%\n2. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO)\n8.28%\n3. Qualcomm\n6.57%\n4. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)\n6.55%\n5. Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU)\n5.08%\nData source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of April 26, 2024, and are subject to change.\nThe ETF's second-largest holding is Broadcom, which is a leader in networking and connectivity hardware for data centers. Its Tomahawk 5 switch, for example, is designed to speed up how quickly data travels from one point to another, which is critical in data centers with thousands of GPUs ingesting mountains of information every second. Broadcom also develops AI software on several fronts through its subsidiaries, including VMWare and Symantec.\nAdvanced Micro Devices is another key holding for the SOXX ETF. The company recently launched its MI300 data center chips to compete with Nvidia, and they have already attracted big customers like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms. Plus AMD is a leader in the emerging AI-enabled personal computing market. Millions of notebooks and devices have already been sold with the company's Ryzen AI chips.\nRounding out the top five is Micron Technology, which is a leading producer of memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips. Its HBM3E memory solution was selected by Nvidia to power the new H200 GPU, primarily because of its incredible efficiency. It consumes 30% less power than competing solutions, which is a key consideration for data center operators because electricity is one of their largest costs.\nOutside of the top five, the SOXX ETF owns popular chip stocks like Intel and Texas Instruments. It also has a stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which is responsible for making more than half of the world's chips, including those designed by Nvidia and AMD.\nThe SOXX ETF has gained 53.5% over the past year, which crushes the 22.3% return of the S&P 500, and even trounces the 33.9% return of the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 index.\nAnd that outperformance isn't an anomaly. The ETF delivered a compound annual return of 30.4% over the last five years, and 25.3% over the last 10 years. Technologies like cloud computing and AI have only gone mainstream over the past decade, which explains the incredible performance.\nBesides Jensen Huang's forecasted $1 trillion opportunity for the data center industry, every computer and device could also be fitted with AI capabilities over the long term, so continued market-beating returns in the SOXX ETF is a real possibility.\nBut even if the SOXX ETF delivered a more moderate annual return of 15% over the next 10 years, it would still lead to significant financial gains for investors. The table below shows how different returns would affect an initial investment of $200,000:\nInitial Investment\nCompound Annual Return\nBalance After 10 Years\n$200,000\n15%\n$809,111\n$200,000\n20%\n$1,238,347\n$200,000\n25%\n$1,862,645\n$200,000\n30%\n$2,757,169\nCalculations by author.\nThe SOXX ETF is a great way for investors to play the AI opportunity over the long term, especially after its recent stock split, which makes it far more accessible to those of all experience levels.\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Kayode Omotosho ",
        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 5.9% in the afternoon session after peer, AMD, reported reported first quarter results which highlighted a material increase in its inventory levels. In addition, AMD's guidance for the next quarter was underwhelming as revenue projection was mostly in line with Wall Street's projections.\nSuper Micro Computer, another beneficiary of the current AI wave, reported underwhelming earnings as revenue fell below Wall Street's expectations, with the company calling out supply chain challenges. Like AMD, Super Micro provides data center infrastructure (servers, GPUs, and storage solutions) that power AI models. These include customized cooling racks that enable AI models to deliver better performance.\nOverall, the underwhelming results and mixed outlook provided by these semiconductor players suggest the era of hypergrowth that has propelled the valuation of some of the leading innovators in the AI space might be cooling off as investors become increasingly cautious.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 11 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago, when the company gained 6.2% as markets rallied, with the Nasdaq up 2.1%, while the S&P rose 1.1%, following strong earnings from big tech companies including Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. Notably, the earnings highlighted the strong demand for AI solutions, including cutting-edge AI chips that power most AI applications. These chips are developed by Nvidia and its peers.\nFor example, during its Q1'2024 earnings call, Meta raised its forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year. The increased costs are related to the company's AI infrastructure. It also released its AI assistant, Meta AI. This product was rolled out across its family of apps and is powered by Llama 3, an open-source large language model that is a ChatGPT competitor.\nAlso, during its earnings, Microsoft noted that its operating cash flow was impacted by higher capital expenditures to support cloud and AI offerings, and guided for \"capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments.\" Lastly, Alphabet struck a similar tone, adding during its earnings, \"You can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures. This will fuel growth in cloud help us push the frontiers of AI models.\"\nOverall, the future looks promising for Nvidia as it continues to meet growing market demand within the AI space.\nNvidia is up 72.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $829.38 per share it is still trading 12.7% below its 52-week high of $950.02 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $18,394.\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "Text": "By Stephen Nellis and Arsheeya Bajwa\n(Reuters) -For chip designer Nvidia, the generative artificial intelligence boom is a gift that keeps on giving.\nAfter riding a demand surge sparked by Big Tech's rush to roll out chatbots, Nvidia now expects new AI models that are capable of creating video and engaging in human-like voice interactions to spur more orders for its graphics processors.\n\"There's a lot of information in life that has to be grounded by video, grounded by physics. So that's the next big thing,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\"You've got 3D video and you've got a whole bunch of stuff you're learning from. So those systems are going to be quite large.\"\nThe need for more computing power to train and run advanced AI systems has buoyed demand for Nvidia's Grace Hopper chips such as the H200, which was first used in OpenAI's GPT-4o - a multimodal model capable of realistic voice conversation with the ability to interact across text and image.\nNvidia's other customers, including Google DeepMind and Meta Platforms, have also released AI image or video generation platforms.\nThe chipmaker on Wednesday forecast quarterly revenue far above estimates, after clocking more than five-fold growth in sales at its data center unit in the first quarter.\nNvidia rallied 9% on Thursday, with the chipmaker's bumper revenue forecast helping lift shares across the semiconductor sector.\n\"The demand is broad based and the large language models need to be increasingly multimodal, understanding not just video but also text, speech, 2D and 3D images,\" said Derren Nathan, the head of equity analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown.\nAI models for video used in the automotive industry are also emerging as a big driver of demand for Nvidia chips.\nTesla has expanded its cluster of processors used in AI training to about 35,000 H100s as it chases autonomous driving, Nvidia's finance chief Colette Kress said on a post-earnings call on Wednesday.\nKress added that the automotive industry was expected to be the largest enterprise vertical in Nvidia's data center business this year.\n\"It (video generation) is certainly one of the strong and already proven use cases for AI and it is extending beyond just content production,\" Hargreaves Lansdown's Nathan said.\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Writing by Aditya Soni; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n"

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    and Julie Hyman    ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang doesn't lack demand. What he lacks is supply.\nIn an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance following the company's first quarter earnings report Wednesday, Huang pushed back against concerns the company could face a demand lull as it shifts between its current and next generation of AI chips.\n\"People want to deploy these data centers right now,\" Huang said. \"They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\"\nNvidia is transitioning from its current Hopper AI platform to its more advanced Blackwell system. Ahead of the company's results on Wednesday, some analysts on Wall Street had raised questions about whether some customers would be more cautious with Hopper orders ahead of the release of the more desirable Blackwell units later this year.\n\"Hopper demand grew throughout this quarter \u2014 after we announced Blackwell \u2014 and so that kind of tells you how much demand there is out there,\" Huang said.\nHuang added that demand for both platforms will outstrip supply well into next year, with the complexity of these chips also challenging the company's efforts to keep pace.\n\"Every component, every part of our data center, is the most complex computer the world's ever made,\" Huang said. \"And so it's sensible that almost everything is constrained.\"\nFor the first quarter, Nvidia reported results that topped Wall Street forecasts, with adjusted earnings per share reaching $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, a 461% and 262% jump from the prior year, respectively. Non-GAAP operating income tallied $18.1 billion in the first quarter.\nIn the current quarter, Nvidia expects revenue to reach $28 billion plus or minus 2%. That\u2019s better than the $26.6 billion analysts had expected.\nThe company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split \u2014 in which shareholders will receive 10 shares for every one share of the company they currently own \u2014 that will go into effect June 10 for shareholders as of June 7.\nNvidia also joined its Big Tech peers in boosting its quarterly dividend, with shareholders now set to receive a dividend of $0.10 per share, up from $0.04.\nNvidia stock rose over 9% in early trading Thursday.\nHuang also discussed how Nvidia will navigate the transition from AI training, in which companies train AI models, to AI inferencing, where those same companies deploy models for customers to use.\nQuestions have swirled about whether large-scale cloud providers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) would drop Nvidia's chips for inferencing in favor of their own offerings.\nBut Huang sees Nvidia's offerings as being just as powerful for inference as they are for training.\n\"We have a great position in inference, because inference is just a really complicated problem,\" he said.\n\"The software stack is complicated. The type of models that people use is complicated. The vast majority of inferencing today is done on Nvidia. And so, we expect that to continue.\"\nThe CEO also touched on the growth the company is seeing in sales to customers beyond the major cloud service providers, saying that companies ranging from Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA) to pharmaceutical firms are increasingly buying up Nvidia chips. In fact, the biggest industry using Nvidia's data center chip, excluding the cloud companies, is automotive.\n\"Tesla is far ahead in self-driving cars,\" Huang said. \"But every single car, someday we will have to have autonomous capability.\"\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Author": "  Fanny Potkin ",
        "Text": "By Fanny Potkin\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Nvidia's most advanced AI chip it developed for the China market has got off to a weak start, with abundant supply forcing it to be priced below a rival chip from Chinese tech giant Huawei, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nThe flattening prices underscore the challenges Nvidia's China business faces amid U.S. sanctions on AI chip exports and heightened competition, casting a cloud over its future in a market that contributed 17% to its revenue for fiscal 2024.\nThe growing competitive pressure in China also adds a cautionary note to investors in the U.S. semiconductor designer as its shares extended a stunning rally following Wednesday's bumper revenue forecast.\nNvidia, which dominates the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, introduced three chips tailored for China late last year after U.S. sanctions prevented it from exporting its most advanced semiconductors.\nAmong those chips, the H20 is the most closely watched as it's the most powerful Nvidia product sold in China, but the three supply chain sources told Reuters there is an abundant supply of the chip in the market, signalling weak demand.\nThat has seen H20 chips being sold in some cases at an over 10% discount to Huawei's Ascend 910B - the most powerful AI chip from a Chinese company - two of the three sources told Reuters, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nAnalysts said while Nvidia was trying hard to capture share in a market it cannot afford to lose, the outlook is increasingly uncertain.\nChina's global share of the AI industry is projected to exceed 30% in 2035, according to a report by Chinese market research firm CCID Consulting.\n\"Nvidia is walking a fine line and working on a balancing act between maintaining the Chinese market and navigating U.S. tensions,\" said Hebe Chen, a market analyst at IG. \"Nvidia is definitely preparing for the worst in the long term.\"\nDuring Nvidia's first quarter earnings on Wednesday, senior executives warned that the company's business in China is \"substantially\" lower than in the past due to the sanctions.\n\"Our data centre revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October,\" said CFO Colette Kress. \"We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward.\"\nAnalysts said the H20's performance will be a major factor for its business in China, while longer-term prospects will depend on how it competes with home-grown tech giant Huawei.\nHuawei only began to challenge Nvidia last year and the sources have said the Guangdong-based company will dramatically increase its shipments of its Ascend 910B chip this year, which the sources said outperforms the H20 in some key metrics.\nHuawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn the past six months, just five state or state-affiliated buyers have expressed interest in purchasing H20 chips, compared with over a dozen for Huawei's 910B in the same period, according to Reuters's checks on available government procurement data, which is not exhaustive and may not reflect the full extent of market demand.\nNvidia's H800 and A800 are banned in China due to U.S. sanctions aimed at limiting China's capabilities in becoming a tech powerhouse. Its other advanced product lines, including H100 and B100, have also been banned.\nAnother major stumbling block to the success of Nvidia's H20 chip in China has been a directive by Beijing for companies to buy Chinese chips, although two of the three sources said those orders had eased in recent months.\nThe H20 became widely available in China last month, with deliveries to clients in little over a month, the sources said.\nSome of China's technology giants have already made orders, with Alibaba ordering over 30,000 H20 chips, according to two of the sources. Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nServer distributors in China are selling the H20 at prices around 100,000 yuan per card, and the eight-card server for around 1.1 million yuan to 1.3 million yuan per server, the sources said.\nIn comparison, distributors are selling the Huawei 910B at above 120,000 yuan per card, while its eight-card server equivalent starts at 1.3-1.5 million yuan per server. The sources added that prices for both the H20 and Huawei's 910B can fluctuate depending on the size of orders placed.\nDylan Patel, founder of research group SemiAnalysis, said close to a million H20 chips will be shipped to China in the second half of 2024 and Nvidia must compete with Huawei on pricing.\n\"The H20 cost more than an H100 to manufacture due to its higher memory capacity,\" Patel said, adding that it is being sold, however, at half the price of the H100, referring to the powerful Nvidia chip banned from export to China in 2022.\n\"This is a dramatic decrease in margin.\"\n(Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore and Beijing newsroom; Additional reporting by Eduardo Baptista; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Shri Navaratnam)\n"

It\u2019s an infrastructure that\u2019s insanely complicated.\u201d\nDell is one of the largest providers of computing infrastructure to government agencies and businesses \u2014 a market that Nvidia doesn\u2019t directly serve. Though Nvidia\u2019s sales have surged in the past year, it has mostly relied on a small group of customers for that growth: the data center operators known as hyperscalers. Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are its biggest customers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg \u2014 though Dell is close behind.\nNvidia\u2019s expansion plan hinges on getting agencies and businesses to develop their own AI capabilities, spurring demand for its products. For that, they\u2019ll need the storage, networking and computing supplied by Dell, Huang said. That\u2019s why it\u2019s an essential partner, he said.\nThe CEO is pushing Nvidia deeper into software tools, computer design and AI models, helping spread the company\u2019s technology into everything from drug discovery to shipbuilding. Nvidia has succeeded because it prepared for the shift toward AI and has out-innovated all of its competitors, said Michael Dell, who also spoke on Bloomberg Television.\nNvidia\u2019s stock, up more than 90% this year, rose 2.8% to $951.07 in New York trading on Monday. Dell, which also has rallied about 90% this year, was down 2.3% at $146.06.\nNvidia \u2014 the most valuable tech company after Microsoft and Apple Inc. \u2014 is slated to report its latest earnings on Wednesday. Analysts estimate that sales grew 243% last quarter. The company\u2019s revenue has grown so quickly that Nvidia now makes nearly as much in a quarter as it did annually just two years ago.\nDell, a top maker of personal computers, unveiled a new line of PCs on Monday that are optimized for AI tasks. Nvidia, meanwhile, is the biggest seller of so-called AI accelerators \u2014 the processors that are key to development of chatbots and other cutting-edge tools.\nNvidia currently sells graphics chips for PCs, but not the central processing units, or CPUs. Huang declined to say whether the company will ultimately produce the CPU itself, a move that would put it in direct competition with Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc.\nBefore Huang could discuss a potential move into that area, Michael Dell interrupted and said, \u201cCome back next year.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn\u2019t\nThe Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade\nA Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of \u2018Trump Forever\u2019\nGoogle\u2019s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth\nTikTok Video Playing on Finance Bro Stereotype Becomes a Viral Hit\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

The firm first raised concerns about Musk's compensation in 2018 when it was granted.\n\u201cGlass Lewis raised a number of concerns about the [2018] grant, including the quantum of pay and the dilutive impact on disinterested shareholders,\u201d the firm wrote in a large report issued over the weekend. The firm said the \u201cmost substantive\u201d of its prior concerns remain the same.\n\u201cThe excessive size of the award, both on a pure dollar basis and in terms of the dilutive effect upon exercise, remains very much top of mind as discussed in fuller detail above. The Company's provided rationale does little to combat these concerns given their proportionate magnitude.\u201d\nShares fell about 2% on Tuesday following the Glass Lewis report.\nGlass Lewis also said Tesla moving its state of incorporation to Texas is unwarranted at this time.\nEarlier this year, Tesla filed its proxy statement ahead of the EV maker's June 13 shareholder meeting with two big requests: that shareholders vote to ratify CEO Elon Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package, which had been rescinded by a Delaware judge earlier this year, and that they agree to move Tesla\u2019s state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware.\nThe Delaware court found the package was awarded to Musk by a board that didn\u2019t act \u201cin the best interests\u201d of Tesla and showed \u201cbarely any evidence of negotiations at all.\u201d Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package was worth around $56 billion; Glass Lewis\u2019s calculations now claim Musk\u2019s current package is valued at around $44.9 billion.\nIf that weren't enough, Musk has threatened to pull AI and other high-value tech projects from Tesla if he doesn\u2019t have approximately 25% ownership control of Tesla.\nGiven the size of the pay package and the heightened focus on Tesla stock in general, Wall Street expects the results of the vote could be a rocky time for shareholders.\nMinneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari became the latest Fed official to call for higher-for-longer interest rates.\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:\nKashkari said Tuesday he is still not ruling out an interest rate hike, but it\u2019s more likely the central bank could hold rates steady for an \"extended\" time as it waits for inflation to drop.\n\"We could sit here for as long as necessary until we get convinced that inflation is sustainably going back down to our 2% target,\" he said.\nWhile holding rates at their current 23-year high \"for an extended period of time is a more likely outcome,\" Kashkari made it clear that other options are on the table if inflation doesn't fall.\n\"I'm not ruling out potential interest rate increases from here,\" he said.\nThe Fed decided on May 1 to keep its benchmark interest rate in a range of 5.25%-5.50% as it tries to get inflation down to its goal of 2%.\nMinutes from that meeting released last week indicated some policymakers discussed their willingness to raise rates if needed.\n\"Various participants mentioned a willingness to tighten policy further should risks to inflation materialize in a way that such an action became appropriate,\u201d according to the minutes.\nHopes for a rate cut this year are dwindling. Investors have now scaled back the odds of the potential first rate cut in September, with a 50% chance the Fed won\u2019t cut rates that month. Odds of a cut in November are 46%.\nThe inflation readings in the first quarter were hotter than expected, but an April reading released after the Fed's last meeting did show some easing of those price pressures.\nThis Friday, officials will get a fresh reading from their preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index on a core basis, which strips out volatile food and energy prices.\nEconomists expect April's \"core\" PCE clocked in at an annual gain of 2.8%, flat from March's increase. Over the prior month, economists expect \"core\" PCE rose 0.2%, down from 0.3% the month prior.\nOn Tuesday, UBS Investment Bank US equity strategist Jonathan Golub joined the growing list of Wall Street strategists boosting their outlook for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) this year.\nGolub boosted his year-end target to 5,600 from 5,400, citing \"stronger earnings.\"\n\"While subsequent quarter earnings estimates typically decline during earnings season, [second quarter] estimates have also been quite robust,\" Golub wrote. \"A similar pattern is also evident in full-year 2024 estimates. These trends all support further market upside.\"\nS&P 500 earnings grew 6% in the first quarter, and when excluding dismal earnings from Bristol Myers-Squibb (BMY), earnings grew more than 10%, per Bank of America.\nThis comes as earnings for future quarters are on the rise too. Earnings growth estimates for full-year 2024 and 2025 have increased since April 5, per FactSet data. Consensus now sees earnings growing 11.4% in 2024, up from 10.9% in April. For 2025, earnings growth estimates have moved up to 14.2% from the 11.6% growth seen on April 5.\nHere are some of the stocks on Yahoo Finance's trending ticker page in afternoon trading on Tuesday:\nNvidia (NVDA): The stock climbed above $1,100 for the first time ever on Tuesday, on pace to close above record highs, after Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence startup xAI said it raised $6 billion in a Series B funding round. Musk said the company is in the process of building a supercomputer, which will be powered by Nvidia's chip technology.\nGameStop (GME): Shares surged as much as 22% after the video game retailer said it raised almost $1 billion from its latest equity offering. Fellow meme darling AMC Entertainment (AMC) also capitalized on the meme frenzy by raising $250 million through the sale of 72.5 million shares earlier this month. Shares of AMC rose about 10%.\nDraftKings (DKNG): Shares dropped more than 10% after the Illinois Senate passed a bill that includes new tax hikes on sports betting. The hikes would make Illinois the second-most-expensive state for online sports gambling companies to operate in \u2014 only behind New York. Analysts warn other states could soon follow Illinois' lead. Flutter Entertainment (FLUT, FLTR.L), the owner of FanDuel, also fell on the news, with shares down about 7%.\nCelsius Holdings (CELH): Shares plummeted 16% on Tuesday after Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian warned in a new note to clients that year-over-year sales growth for Celsius energy drinks appears to be slowing on a sequential basis.\nStocks traded mixed on Tuesday to kick off a shortened holiday trading week.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the day, up about 0.5%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flatline after its fifth straight week of gains while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.4%. Stocks are currently on pace to secure their best month of the year.\nMeanwhile, Treasury yields moved higher after a rebound in consumer confidence. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) nudged about 3 basis points higher to trade near 4%.\nThe latest index reading from the Conference Board came in at 102, above 97.5 in April and higher than the 96 economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected.\nThe index was buoyed by a strong labor market and marked the first increase of consumer confidence in four months. Still, \"for the fourth consecutive month, the Expectations Index was below 80, the threshold which usually signals a recession ahead,\" The Conference Board warned.\nNvidia (NVDA) shares traded above $1,100 for the first time ever on Tuesday.\nThe milestone moment comes as the stock gained about 5% after Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence startup xAI raised $6 billion in a Series B funding round, the company announced in a blog post. The funding brings the valuation of xAI to $24 billion.\nThe increase of AI competition has continued to boost Nvidia's growth rate as the chipmaker continues its record-setting rally.\nLast week, Nvidia reported first quarter results that impressed Wall Street. The company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split and an increased dividend.\nGameStop (GME) stock surged as much as 22% on Tuesday with shares opening at around $23. The moves come after the video game retailer said it raised almost $1 billion from its latest equity offering.\nAlthough shares are still well below the near $65 level reached earlier this month during a short-lived meme rally, the stock action reflects investor exuberance over the meme trade.\nYahoo Finance's Ines Ferr\u00e9 reports:\n\u201cIf this were a normal market, people would be a little freaked out,\u201d Steve Sosnick, Interactive Brokers' chief strategist, told Yahoo Finance.\nHe added, \u201cYou don\u2019t sell stock into the market if you think your stock is undervalued. You do it when you think your stock is overvalued.\u201d\nGameStop is a heavily shorted stock, with short interest just above 21% of the float.\nThe company took advantage of mid-May's unexpected meme rally, selling 45 million shares to bring in about $933 million, according to a Friday statement.\nGameStop said it intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments.\nThe offering was first announced on May 17 along with the company\u2019s preliminary financial results, sending shares tanking as much as 30% that day.\nThe offering was seen as a smart move by some Wall Street analysts amid the video game retailer\u2019s struggling financials. GameStop's quarterly sales fell sharply from the year earlier period, according to its most recent earnings report.\nAs home prices notched a new all-time high in March, certain cities remained more susceptible to rising costs.\nRegionally, San Diego continued to report the highest year-over-year gain among the 20 major cities, rising 11.1% in March. New York and Cleveland also increased 9.2% and 8.8%, respectively.\nElevated mortgage rates, high home prices, and limited housing stock have challenged homebuyers. In March, mortgage rates hovered around the mid-6% range. Last week, they fell below 7% for the first time since early April.\nDespite pent-up demand for homes, low inventory remains a problem, which hasn't allowed home prices to ease. But that dynamic is expected to change.\n\"Although we expect mortgage rates to drift lower in the next few years, we also expect inventory to gradually normalise which should help cool the market,\"\u00a0Thomas Ryan, North American economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients after the release. Ryan and his team expect home prices to climb by 3% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026.\nThe seasonally adjusted S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index (HPI) rose 0.3% month over month in March and jumped 6.5% on a year-over-year basis \u2014 the second strongest annual gain since late 2022, Oxford Economics said in a note to clients following the data's release.\n\"We expect home price growth to remain positive in the quarters ahead, with risks skewed to the upside,\" Oxford Economics lead economist Bernard Yaros wrote. \"Scarce supply in the resale market, a sturdy labor market, and pent-up demand from Millennials aging into their prime household-formation years argue for potentially firmer house price gains than in our baseline forecast.\"\nAccording to the data, prices in the 20 biggest US metro areas hit another all-time high in March.\nYaros added that although he expects \"declines in mortgage rates as the first rate cut by the Federal Reserve comes into view\" prices should continue to remain elevated amid a \"historically tight\" supply of homes for sale.\nMeanwhile, the seasonally adjusted Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) House Price Index also rose during the month of March but at a slower pace compared to previous months. The index climbed just 0.1% after rising 1.2% month over month in February.\n\"Though base effects have started to become less favorable for the FHFA index, it is still rising on an annual basis faster than it did for most of 2023,\" Yaros said.\nConsumer confidence unexpectedly rose in May.\nThe latest index reading from the Conference Board was 102, above 97.5 in April and higher than the 96 economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected. The May reading ended three months of declines for the index.\n\"Consumers\u2019 assessment of current business conditions was slightly less positive than last month,\" the Conference Board chief economist Dana Peterson said in the release. \"However, the strong labor market continued to bolster consumers\u2019 overall assessment of the present situation. Views of current labor market conditions improved in May, as fewer respondents said jobs were \u2018hard to get.'\"\nPeterson added: \"Fewer consumers expected deterioration in future business conditions, job availability, and income, resulting in an increase in the Expectation Index.\"\nUS stocks opened mixed on Tuesday, with tech serving as a bright spot ahead of a critical inflation report due later this week.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed about 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added roughly 0.4% after solid closing gains on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the biggest laggard of the morning, slipping 0.3%.\nFoot Locker (FL) has had a horrendous 12 months.\nPoor financial performances have led to surprisingly poor outlooks, sending shares down 16% in the past year.\nThe Street is bracing for another dreadful quarter from the sneaker and sportswear retailer when it reports Thursday morning.\nEvercore ISI analyst Michael Binetti said investors should expect a \"very tough quarter.\" The company could warn again for the full year.\nHe pointed to several reasons why:\nWe have started to see Wall Street crunch the numbers on the economic impact of the new tariffs that former President Donald Trump would be keen on implementing if he were to win a second term.\nToday Evercore ISI weighs in with its take:\n"

        "Text": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Kevin Buckland\nTwo of the biggest events of this week are almost upon us, as Wednesday brings an end to the drawn-out two-day news vacuum that has seen markets drift along with little clear direction.\nThe headliner surely is the long-awaited earnings report and accompanying commentary from AI darling Nvidia, which undoubtedly will determine whether the Nasdaq bursts through the all-time highs it set this week - or beats a sharp retreat.\nAI fever has propelled the Nasdaq to a more than 12% gain this year, while the Philadelphia SE semiconductor index - or SOX - is up a staggering 21.5%, giving both plenty of room to fall.\nNvidia's options signal volatility ahead: They're primed for an 8.7% swing in either direction by Friday, equivalent to $200 billion in market cap.\nNext in the rankings, at least from a global investor's perspective, is the minutes of the Federal Reserve's most recent policy meeting.\nWhile the meeting predates the widely welcomed downside surprise in U.S. CPI from last week, it will still be parsed carefully for clues on the likely policy path, particularly as Fed officials have so far refused to turn sanguine on inflation risks.\nGovernor Waller, Vice Chair of Supervision Barr and no fewer than three regional Fed chiefs all urged continued patience overnight, adding to a chorus that has been building by the day. Chicago Fed boss Goolsbee takes the podium later today.\nThe dollar has been content to drift sideways to slightly higher against its major rivals this week.\nSterling, though, has shown particular resilience, marking a two-month top on Tuesday. The currency will be tested today by UK CPI data, the biggest event locally.\nThe extent to which price pressures mitigate, or refuse to, in the April figures is likely to tip the odds for a June rate cut, which is currently seen as a coin toss.\nUnlike at the Fed, Bank of England policy makers have been split on the outlook, with Governor Bailey saying this month that future cuts might need to be more than those markets have priced in, only for chief economist Pill to say the next day that betting too heavily on a June cut would be a bad idea.\nDeputy Governor Breeden takes part in a panel discussion today.

        "Title": "Could This Be Nvidia's Next Growth Driver?",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that are powering the crucial artificial intelligence (AI) tasks of training and inferencing. Thanks to the GPU's top speed, large language models (LLMs) process all of the data they need to go on do their job -- from offering us conversational assistants to streamlining a company's workflow.\nThough these chips play a key role in Nvidia's success, they aren't the only item this top tech company offers to potential customers. Nvidia actually sells a range of products and services to advance AI projects -- and one in particular is emerging as a potential winner. In fact, Nvidia, which already highlighted this business in its past earnings call, may offer us more details during this week's earnings report. Could it become the company's next growth driver? Let's take a closer look.\nFirst a bit of background on Nvidia's path so far. For years, the company's biggest business was serving the video game industry -- but in more recent times, it became clear that the GPU's ability to simultaneously process tasks could be useful in other industries. Nvidia created the parallel computing platform CUDA to make that happen -- and what followed was an expansion into many areas, including AI.\nThese days, Nvidia's data center revenue far surpasses its video game revenue -- $18.4 billion vs $2.9 billion in the most recent quarter. Data center includes revenue from AI chips along with all other AI-related products and services. And this brings me to Nvidia's next potential growth driver: software.\nSoftware is essential for businesses to run AI applications, and accelerated computing involves a lot more complexity than general computing. The problem is each individual company launching an AI project doesn't have the extensive engineering team necessary to oversee software stacks across every cloud and on premises.\nThat's where Nvidia comes in. Chief executive officer Jensen Huang describes Nvidia AI Enterprise as sort of an operating system for AI. Through this platform, Nvidia manages customers' software stacks and \"containerizes\" them into the Nvidia stack. This business already has reached a $1 billion run rate, and it's in its early days. In fact, Huang predicts every enterprise software company launching software in any cloud or on premises will run on Nvidia AI Enterprise -- making it \"a very significant business over time.\"\nSo, is Huang being too optimistic or could this really be a big growth driver for the company? It's important to remember that AI still is in its early days, meaning companies and organizations are just getting started when it comes to investing in AI and launching projects. So need for not only Nvidia's GPUs but also its AI Enterprise service should increase from this point.\nNvidia also has built a solid reputation as the go-to company if you're looking for premium GPUs -- and it's logical that many customers won't stop there but will instead sign on for this package that could make their AI experience more efficient and successful.\nAll of this means AI Enterprise could be Nvidia's next important growth driver, and investors should look for any details about progress in this area during the earnings report on Wednesday. Software growth could take time, though, as companies don't launch AI projects overnight -- instead, we may see a progressive increase in demand over the coming years.\nWhat does this mean for you as an investor? Nvidia has seen explosive growth in revenue and earnings in recent times, and I expect growth to continue thanks to the company's leadership and the general industry outlook. But I wouldn't be discouraged if growth ebbs and flows at certain points -- it's unlikely to see revenue soar at a higher and higher pace without any sort of pause.\nWhat's most important is Nvidia's range of products and services, including software, has what it takes to supercharge revenue over the long term as customers turn to this AI leader. All that means it's a great idea to buy and hold Nvidia stock to benefit from the next chapters of the AI story.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- US officials have slowed the issuing of licenses to chipmakers such as Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for large-scale AI accelerator shipments to the Middle East, according to people familiar with the matter, while officials conduct a national security review of AI development in the region.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nModi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority\nModi\u2019s Magic Is Fading Fast. Who\u2019s Next for India?\nShort Sellers in Danger of Extinction After Crushing Stock Gains\nBlackRock, Citadel Back Texas Stock Exchange in Challenge to NYSE\nBonds Rally as Traders Reload Fed Bets After Data: Markets Wrap\nIt\u2019s unclear how long the review will take, nor is there a concrete definition of what constitutes a large shipment, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Officials are particularly focused on high-volume sales, the people said, as countries including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia look to import massive quantities of the chips used in AI data centers.\nAI accelerators \u2014 a category pioneered by Nvidia \u2014 help data centers process the flood of information needed to develop artificial intelligence chatbots and other tools. They\u2019ve become essential equipment for companies and governments seeking to build an AI infrastructure.\nIn October, the Commerce Department added much of the Middle East to chip export restrictions that originally focused on China and a handful of other foreign adversaries. That meant companies needed a special US government license to ship cutting-edge semiconductors and chipmaking tools to countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\nUS officials have delayed or not responded to license applications submitted under that rule in the past several weeks, some of the people said. That includes attempts to sell to customers in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, according to one of the people. In addition to Nvidia and AMD, Intel Corp. and startup Cerebras Systems Inc. also make accelerator chips. The four companies declined to comment.\nThe goal is to give Washington time to develop a comprehensive strategy around how the advanced chips will be deployed overseas, according to the people. That includes negotiating who manages and secures the facilities used to train AI models, some of the people said.\nShares of Nvidia slipped to a low for the day after Bloomberg reported on the license reviews. At the close in New York, the stock was down 3.8% to $1,105. AMD, meanwhile, pared earlier gains. It was up less than 1% to $166.75.\nIn a statement, the Commerce Department said its highest priority was \u201cprotecting national security.\u201d\n\u201cWith regards to the most cutting edge technologies, we conduct extensive due diligence through an interagency process, thoroughly reviewing license applications from applicants who intend to ship these advanced technologies around the world,\u201d a representative for the department said. \u201cAs always, we remain committed to working with our partners in the Middle East and around the world to safeguard our technological ecosystem.\u201d\nThea Kendler, who leads export administration at the Commerce Department, visited the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait earlier this month as part of those ongoing discussions. In the UAE, she indicated that there was progress in collaboration on semiconductor export controls, another person familiar with the matter said.\nPart of the concern is that Chinese companies, which are largely cut off from cutting-edge American technology themselves, could access those chips through data centers in the Middle East. The Biden administration has been waging a broader campaign to keep advanced semiconductors and manufacturing equipment out of China\u2019s hands, for fear that the technology will be used to bolster its military.\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia have been jockeying for regional leadership in AI, aiming to reduce their economies\u2019 dependence on oil. Both countries see the US as a key partner in that effort, and top officials and companies have said they\u2019ll fulfill US requests to keep Chinese supply chains separate \u2014 or divest from Chinese technology entirely.\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia just forged a deal with China\u2019s Lenovo Group Ltd. that involves the computer maker building a research and development center in Riyadh.\nRead More: Lenovo Forges Saudi Pact With $2 Billion Convertibles Issue\nThe ability to secure export licenses is a major part of negotiations surrounding Microsoft Corp.\u2019s $1.5 billion investment in Abu Dhabi AI firm G42 \u2014 a partnership that followed months of talks with US officials.\n--With assistance from Nick Wadhams.\n(Updates shares in seventh paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nStartup Brings New Hope to the Pursuit of Reviving Frozen Bodies\nThe Budget Geeks Who Helped Solve an American Economic Puzzle\nElon and Donald Seem to Have Made Up\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year\nDisney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Could ARM Holdings Dethrone Nvidia?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best companies to be invested in over the past year. It has shot up like a rocket on the back of massive graphics processing unit (GPU) demand driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race. GPUs are great for AI workloads because they allow parallel processing, making them far more powerful when crunching massive problems like AI model training.\nWhile these GPUs are incredibly powerful, they aren't very energy-efficient. As AI workloads begin to take shape, GPUs may no longer be the best choice to run these models, and more energy-efficient designs from Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) may take their place.\nSo, could Arm dethrone Nvidia from atop the AI world? Let's find out.\nAs mentioned before, GPUs are fantastic because of their versatility. When a model is just starting to take shape, it is wise to use a GPU to quickly check its validity. However, now that AI model creation is becoming a more standardized workload, companies like Alphabet (Google) are designing their own products. Recently, Google announced its Google Axion CPU, which will be solely available to Google Cloud customers. This product is based on Arm's ultra-efficient CPU (central processing unit) technology and could decrease the amount of GPUs Alphabet buys from Nvidia if the product becomes a hit.\nGoogle Cloud isn't the only cloud provider doing this, either.\nMicrosoft Azure announced a similar product back in November. Its Cobalt CPU is another Arm-based processor, but it is used for general-purpose workloads rather than AI ones. While this isn't an issue for Nvidia yet, if Microsoft sees success with its in-house design, it may consider creating a similar product to the Google Axion to bring down some of its costs associated with AI.\nWhile Arm isn't quite ready to dethrone Nvidia yet, there is some writing on the wall that signals it could challenge some of Nvidia's business in the future. But does that make it a stock worth buying?\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended March 31), Arm's revenue rose 47% year over year to $928 million, a significant acceleration to its 21% full-year revenue increase. Because Arm is a design firm, it has fantastic margins and converted an incredible 69% of that to $637 million in free cash flow.\nIt also gave solid guidance, with revenue expected to be around $900 million in the first quarter and $3.95 billion in fiscal year 2025, indicating 33% and 22% growth, respectively.\nHowever, this success comes with a hefty price tag, and Arm's stock isn't cheap. At 73 times forward earnings and 37 times sales, it's an incredibly expensive stock.\nFor comparison, Nvidia trades at 38 times forward earnings and 37 times sales. That shows how much Nvidia is expected to grow in 2024, so it's clear that the market doesn't think the threat from Arm-based designs tailored specifically for certain workloads is a threat to Nvidia's core business.\nThere's no doubt that Arm's designs could challenge some Nvidia products in the future, but right now, the two are vital partners. Nvidia owns around $147 million in Arm's stock because the two collaborate to create products. The Nvidia Grace CPU utilizes Arm technology and can be paired with Nvidia's GPUs to create a powerful system that processes large language models quickly.\nSo, while Arm may be working with Nvidia's competitors, it's also a vital partner to Nvidia itself. Arm, or more specifically, Arm's customers, won't dethrone Nvidia anytime soon. However, with how expensive Arm stock is, I think it's one that investors should avoid due to its hefty price tag, even with its top-tier technology.\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Arm Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Josh Schafer    \u00b7 Reporter",
        "Text": "Stocks have once again ended a trading week having hit new records. \nSigns of an inflation cooldown prompted markets to grow more optimistic about the prospect of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and stocks rallied as a result, with all three major averages hitting record highs on Wednesday. \nFor the week, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 1%, closing above 40,000 for the first time ever on Friday.\nIn the week ahead, highly anticipated earnings results from Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to be the key catalyst for markets. Results from Target (TGT), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), and Lowe's (LOW) will also be closely tracked by investors.\nThe week is expected to be quieter on the economic front, with updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors as well as the final reading of consumer sentiment for May on tap. Minutes from the Fed's May meeting are also expected on Wednesday afternoon.\nApril's reading of the Consumer Price Index showed core prices, which strip out the more volatile costs of food and gas, rose 3.6% over last year \u2014 the lowest annual rise in three years. This prompted investors to price in two full interest rate cuts this year for the first time since early April.\nThe move brings the market closer in line with the Fed's projections of two or three interest rate cuts at some point this year. BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski listed investors' alignment with the Fed on interest rate cuts as a reason supporting his call for the S&P 500 to end 2024 at 5,600, an increase of less than 7% from Friday's close.\nFor investors, the key question will be whether this bullish narrative is sustainable or if the market will once again jump ahead of the Fed as it did in early 2024 when investors priced in nearly seven interest rate cuts on the back of positive economic data. The first test will come on Wednesday with the release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's May meeting, which will provide a deeper look at the discussion among officials.\n\"The minutes from the May FOMC meeting should sound more hawkish on the margin than Chair Powell's press conference,\" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients. \"Though Powell signaled the bar for hikes is high and that standing pat is the proper response to disinflation stalling out, others on the committee were more concerned about whether policy was doing enough.\"\nBelski's year-end target bump was followed by another forecast raise on Friday. Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha boosted his year-end target for the benchmark to 5,500 from 5,100. Chadha cited robust earnings growth and an improving macroeconomic outlook as reasons stocks could keep moving higher.\n\"We see the earnings cycle having plenty of legs,\" Chadha said. \"While all the growth may not materialize this year, we see market confidence in a continued recovery rising by year end, supporting equity multiples.\"\nAI leader Nvidia is set to report earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, capping off the reports from America's tech giants. Expectations are once again sky-high for the chipmaker. Analysts expect Nvidia grew earnings by more than 400% in the prior quarter while revenue increased 242%, per Bloomberg consensus data.\nFor the second quarter, analysts project earnings growth of more than 120% and nearly 100% revenue growth.\n\"We see enough room for NVDA to post FQ1E (April) revenue potentially as high as $26B (data center ~$22-23B) and potentially guide to ~$27-28B in total revenue (data center ~$25-26B) \u2014 both good enough to keep the stock biased higher, in our view,\" UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote in a note to clients previewing the earnings release.\nThe stock is up more than 86% in 2024 and more than 200% over the past year since Nvidia kicked off the AI hype train with its blowout earnings report in May 2023. Given how Nvidia's stock has impacted other potential AI plays, and the broader market as a whole, all eyes will be on whether the company can once again live up to the hype.\n\"If [Nvidia] can continue their enviable, remarkable string of beating estimates, raising guidance, then beating the raised guidance next quarter, that means that the AI trade can and will proceed apace,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick wrote in a research note on Thursday. \"If there is even the slightest sign of weakness, however, much more than that stock alone will suffer.\"\nNvida's updates on its emerging technology demand come at a crucial time for the overall AI story. Increasingly, new companies in sectors are being tabbed AI trades.\nJust this past week, Dell shares rose about 10% as analysts from Morgan Stanley and Evercore ISI revealed bullish research on the company's AI prospects.\nThe AI trade has already been expanding beyond the popular names like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META). Energy and Utilities are two of the best performing sectors in the S&P 500 this year, both adding more than 13%. While strategists have pointed to a catch-up trade in Utilities (XLU), AI has also been a driver of enthusiasm. The same could be said for Energy (XLE).\nResearch from Goldman Sachs' equity strategy team led by David Kostin shows mentions of AI soared in the first quarter amid a \"broadening of the AI trade.\" More than 66% of companies in the energy sector mentioned AI during their earnings calls this quarter, up from 19.1% last quarter.\nJPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist Jack Manley said whether the AI story has legs \"might be one of the more important questions that we have to ask.\"\n\"Is this AI stuff the real deal or is it a flash in the plan?\" Manley told Yahoo Finance. \"And I mean, frankly, the jury is still out on whether or not it will fundamentally transform the world.\"\nHe added, \"If markets wake up to say 'Hey, maybe we got a little bit too excited about this and maybe we pulled forward some of these earnings just a little bit, and that's reflected in those valuations.' That's where I think you have the potential for a bit of a shaky road.\"\n\u00a0\nEarnings: Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Trip.com (TRIP), Zoom (ZM)\nEconomic news: No notable economic news. \nTuesday\nEarnings: AutoZone (AZO), Macy's (M), XPeng (XPEV), Toll Brothers (TOL), Urban Outfitters (URBN)\nEconomic news: Philadelphia Fed Non-Manufacturing Activity, May (-12.4 previously)\nWednesday\nEarnings: Nvidia (NVDA), e.l.f.

AWS continues to offer other services based on Nvidia's Hopper chips, its flagship model for training artificial intelligence systems (AI), the spokesman said.\nThe Project Ceiba transition was announced by the two firms in March when Nvidia unveiled the new Blackwell chips.\n\"To be clear, AWS did not halt any orders from Nvidia. In our close collaboration with Nvidia, we jointly decided to move Project Ceiba from Hopper to Blackwell GPUs, which offer a leap forward in performance,\" an AWS spokesman said in statement.\nThe Financial Times amended its earlier story to say that Amazon's chip orders had not yet been placed.

        "Title": "Here's Nvidia's Biggest Problem Right Now",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) once again reported an explosive quarter last week, with revenue and net income soaring in the double digits. Nvidia's stock price surged after the report, crossing the $1,000 mark, as the company pleased investors not only with its earnings momentum but also with news of a stock split -- set for early June. This will bring down the price of each individual share, making it easier for a wider array of investors to buy.\nThe company, as the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader, is benefiting as the world turns its attention to AI. This represents great demand, from both companies and governments, for Nvidia's top-performing chip as well as its complete AI systems. And this leads me to Nvidia's biggest problem right now.\nFirst, a quick look at how and why Nvidia has reached its position, dominating the billion-dollar AI chip market. The company started out primarily serving the video game industry with its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips with the ability to process many tasks simultaneously. That equals speed and general high performance, and it eventually became clear that other industries could use such a chip, too.\nNvidia created CUDA, a parallel computing platform, and this opened the door to the GPU's presence in general computing -- including AI. The start of the AI boom represented a key turning point for Nvidia, and we can see this in the company's earnings and share price performance.\nNvidia, first to market with the highest-powered chips for AI, continued to innovate, and that's what's helped the company maintain its market leadership. In fact, Nvidia pledges to release a new chip every year, a promise that could make it extremely difficult for a competitor to unseat this market giant.\nBut amid all of these positive points, Nvidia does face a challenge, and that's the ability to keep up with market demand. Of course, it's great that companies and governments want Nvidia's chips and related products, and the momentum even suggests Nvidia shareholders shouldn't worry too much about a risk that's been mentioned in the past: the fact that Nvidia customers such as Amazon and Meta Platforms are developing their own AI chips.\nBut investors can't ignore the fact that if Nvidia can't supply its customers with what they want when they want, it might risk losing them.\n\"We're racing every single day,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during the company's recent earnings call with analysts. He added that applications like ChatGPT, large language models, and work being done at all of the cloud service providers \"are consuming every GPU that's out there.\"\nHuang said customers are pressuring Nvidia to deliver systems, and this demand surpasses supply.\nThe positive point here is we probably shouldn't worry about Amazon, Meta or other customers exclusively using their own chips -- or other chips -- and forgetting about Nvidia. Instead, what we should keep an eye on is Nvidia's ability to deliver chips and systems to customers -- and maximize its revenue potential. Where Nvidia could lose out is if another player, for example Intel, is able to deliver a rival product more quickly. Some customers still may hold off and wait for Nvidia, but others may opt for the fastest to deliver. If this happens, over the long term it could weigh on the chip designer's growth.\nSo, today, the biggest problem facing Nvidia is the ability to keep up with demand for its products, and it will be important to see how this evolves once the company releases its Blackwell architecture and chip later this year. Since this does represent a major turning point, with Blackwell boasting six innovations, customers probably will be willing to wait if demand soars and this impacts delivery schedules.\nAs of last month, the shortest delivery time for Nvidia's H100 GPU was about two months, down from as much as 11 months last year, according to website Tom's Hardware.\nThough soaring demand represents a problem for Nvidia, it also represents a positive point: Customers want Nvidia's products and services, and to a certain degree are even willing to wait for them. Nvidia clearly is aware of demand surpassing supply, and the company knows rivals are eager to take market share, so I would expect Nvidia will do what it can to keep delivery times down to a reasonable level and keep itself in the lead in this high-growth market.\nInvestors should keep an eye on how the supply-demand problem evolves, but it shouldn't stop investors from buying Nvidia shares right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 7.5% in the afternoon session after continued strong momentum following a strong earnings report last week. This helped drive the Nasdaq to a record high. The tech-heavy index crossed the 17,000 mark.\nThere was also some positive news over the weekend. The Information reported that Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, announced plans to buy Nvidia's AI chips for its new supercomputer. On Monday, May 27, 2024, xAI announced its series B funding round on the social media platform X.com (formerly called Twitter). The AI start-up raised $ 6 billion to \"take xAI's first products to market\" and to \"build advanced Infrastructure.\" According to the reports, it is likely that the development of the infrastructure will birth a massive computing system - dubbed \"the Gigafactory of computing\" - which is expected to use 100,000 semiconductors based on NVDA's H100 GPU, and with an estimated size exceeding 4x the biggest cluster in existence.\nOverall, the report suggested that it is still early days in the hot AI market while providing more definitive insight into the growing demand for Nvidia's AI chips.\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 11 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago, when the company gained 11.2% on the news that the company reported first quarter earnings results. Nvidia recorded healthy gross margin improvement, indicating elevated pricing power. Its revenue and EPS outperformed Wall Street's estimates, driven by better-than-expected results in its data center and automotive segments; the result in its automotive segment (17% year-on-year revenue growth) was especially impressive given the industry is in a cyclical downturn and many other semiconductor companies have posted year-on-year declines for that end market.\nLastly, its inventory levels increased, likely due to the company stocking up on products in anticipation of strong demand. During the announcement of the results, Nvidia issued a 10-1 stock split that will commence on Friday, June 7, 2024. Looking ahead, Nvidia's revenue for the next quarter beat expectations again. Overall, this was a great quarter that shareholders will appreciate.\nNvidia is up 136% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $31,676.\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia's (NVDA) blowout quarter shows demand for data centers in the age of artificial intelligence is insatiable. The challenge, according to experts, will be powering the boom.\n\"The existing power infrastructure from the grid won't be enough to fuel all of the data center demand that is coming down the pike,\" Moody's senior economist Ermengarde Jabir told Yahoo Finance.\nData centers are physical locations where the advanced computing process happens. Power demand from data centers in the US is expected to more than double by 2030 thanks to use of AI, according to research from consulting firm McKinsey & Co.\n\"We are just in the first innings of AI,\" said Pradeep Tagare, vice president of investments at National Grid Partners, a venture capital arm of electricity and gas multinational National Grid (NGG).\nTagare notes utility companies were already planning for increased demand from EV adoption and the electrification of other industries. But the AI boom has added a whole other layer of complexity.\n\"This takes it sort of into a completely different league than what most utilities have been used to over the last decade,\" said Tagare. \u201cWhat AI does is it creates exponential growth in a very short time.\"\nIndustry experts note demand for data centers is coming from hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta (META), along with companies offering cloud computing as a service. Enterprise firms such as banks and pharmaceutical companies are also using AI for their own operations.\n\"People want to deploy these data centers right now,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive interview Wednesday following the company's earnings call.\n\"They want to put our GPUs [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\"\nKevin Ooley, CFO of data center operator DataBank, says new buildouts \u2014 which includes securing the power source, land, zoning, building, and cooling equipment \u2014 can take anywhere between 18 and 24 months.\n\"Power is the big bottleneck right now,\" said Ooley. \"Two years ago, it was supply chain, getting access to the equipment. I would say power right now has jumped ahead of that.\"\nPower companies have been racing to meet growing demand.\nGeorgia-based Southern Company (SO) said its sales to data centers were up over 12% for its latest quarter compared to the same period last year.\n\u201cWe're seeing a continued ramp-up of new facilities, existing facilities ramping up their usage,\u201d CFO Dan Tucker told analysts earlier this month.\nSimilarly, Dominion Energy (D) management highlighted increased demand across the growing data center industry in Northern Virginia.\n\u201cHistorically a single data center typically had a demand of 30 megawatts or greater. However, we're now receiving individual requests for demand of 60 to 90 megawatts or greater, and it hasn't stopped there,\" Dominion CEO Robert Blue told analysts in May.\n\"We get regular requests to support larger data center campuses that include multiple buildings and require total capacity ranging from 300 megawatts to as many as several gigawatts,\u201d he added.\nFor context, one megawatt is roughly enough electricity to fulfill the instantaneous demand of 750 homes at once, according to one utility estimate. \nNuclear power provider Constellation Energy's (CEG) stock is up more than 90% year to date as companies increasingly turn to renewables and nuclear for energy needs. Constellation expects base earnings to grow by at least 10% annually through the decade.\nAnalysts are bullish about the possibility of placing Big Tech's large-scale data centers at Constellation's nuclear sites.\n\"The appeal of non-regulated nuclear, which is what Constellation owns, is that you could build a data center on the land at site and just directly hook into the data power plant there and take power,\" Neil Kalton, senior equity analyst at Wells Fargo, recently told Yahoo Finance.\nIn March Amazon bought a Pennsylvania-based data center for $650 million from independent power producer Talen Energy. The campus is next to Talen's nuclear power plant.\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) went viral early last year and shows no signs of letting up. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) supplies the graphics processing units (GPUs) that underpin the technology, and demand continues unabated. That said, some investors still worry that looming competition, demand in China, or uneven adoption could derail the stock's meteoric rise.\nHowever, given its expanding opportunity, one Wall Street analyst thinks investors continue to underestimate Nvidia's growing AI potential.\nHSBC analyst Frank Lee reiterated his buy rating on the stock and raised his price target to $1,350. That represents potential gains for investors of 49% over the coming year compared to the stock's closing price on Monday. The analyst suggests that Nvidia's sales and profits will be more robust than investors expect.\nWhen the company reports the results for its fiscal 2025 first quarter next week, Nvidia's revenue will top $26 billion, outpacing analysts' consensus estimates of $24.45 billion, according to Lee. Furthermore, for the full year, he believes the company's profits will outpace Wall Street's already elevated expectations by 45%.\nThere's reason to believe the analyst has hit the nail on the head. Investors have continually underestimated the accelerating adoption of AI and its impact on Nvidia's results. The recently released Grace Blackwell GB200 Superchip and NVL36/NVL72 liquid-cooled, rack-scale servers, combined with Nvidia's unmatched pricing power, could result in additional upside potential for its revenue and profits over the coming year.\nFurthermore, while some companies are constrained by the number of Nvidia processors they can lay their hands on, Nvidia is under no such constraint, as it has first dibs on its chips, which gives the company a distinct advantage in the market. This led Lee to conclude the company would sell 35,000 rack systems priced between $1.8 million and $3 million each. This could boost its fiscal 2026 revenue to $196 billion.\nNvidia stock is currently trading at 36 times forward earnings. While that's a premium, it's supported by the company's triple-digit revenue growth, which makes Nvidia stock a buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock: 4 Reasons to Buy, 4 Reasons to Sell",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock jumped 9% to a new all-time high on May 23, after the company posted its latest earnings report. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended on April 28, the chipmaker's revenue surged 262% year over year to $26.0 billion and exceeded analysts' estimates by $1.5 billion. Its adjusted earnings surged 461% to $6.12 per share and also cleared the consensus forecast by $0.54.\nThose growth rates were explosive, but does Nvidia's stock still have room to run after rallying about 2,720% over the past five years? Let's review the four reasons to buy Nvidia's stock -- as well as the four reasons to sell it -- to decide.\nBack in fiscal 2023, which ended in January of that year, Nvidia's revenue flatlined as its adjusted EPS fell 25%. Its sales of gaming GPUs cooled off as PC shipments declined in a post-pandemic market, and the macro headwinds curbed its sales of data center chips. But in fiscal 2024, its revenue and adjusted EPS surged 126% and 288%, respectively.\nMetric\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ4 2024\nQ1 2025\nRevenue growth (YOY)\n(13%)\n101%\n206%\n265%\n262%\nAdjusted gross margin\n66.8%\n71.2%\n75%\n76.7%\n78.9%\nAdjusted EPS growth (YOY)\n(20%)\n429%\n593%\n486%\n461%\nData source: Nvidia.\nThat abrupt acceleration was driven by the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Nvidia's data center GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks, and the market's demand for those chips quickly outstripped its available supply. Nvidia generated 87% of its revenue from its data center chips in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nNvidia also announced a 10-for-1 stock split that will take effect on June 7. The split won't alter Nvidia's valuations, but it might attract some interest from smaller retail investors while boosting the stock's liquidity through more options trading.\nThe bulls still love Nvidia for four reasons. First, they believe it will continue to dominate the AI market with its data center GPUs. The global AI market could still expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% from 2023 to 2030, according to Markets and Markets, and Nvidia could be the simplest way to profit from that secular boom.\nSecond, its first mover's advantage in the AI space gives it tremendous pricing power. Its top-tier H100 GPUs cost more than $40,000, and it can keep raising those prices to boost its gross margin. Third, Nvidia's gaming business, 10% of its first-quarter revenue, is gradually recovering as the PC market stabilizes.\nLastly, Nvidia's stock still looks reasonably valued relative to its growth potential. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 43% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 49%.\nBased on those estimates, Nvidia's stock trades at just 41 times forward earnings. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which is growing at a much slower rate and has less exposure to the AI market, trades at 46 times forward earnings.\nMeanwhile, the bears are skeptical about Nvidia for four reasons. First, they believe Nvidia will lose its first mover's advantage in the data center GPU market as more competitors carve up the market. AMD's new Instinct data center GPUs already cost less than Nvidia's top-tier GPUs, and tech giants such as\u00a0Microsoft, Alphabet's Google, and Meta Platforms have all been developing their own in-house AI chips to reduce their long-term dependence on Nvidia.\nSecond, U.S. regulators recently barred Nvidia from shipping its top-tier AI GPUs to China. That pressure could drive Chinese chipmakers to accelerate their development of comparable AI accelerators. If those efforts are successful, Chinese companies could eventually flood the global market with cheaper AI chips and crush Nvidia's gross margins.\nThird, Nvidia's insiders sold about twice as many shares as they bought over the past 12 months. That cooling insider sentiment suggests that Nvidia could be running out of room to run as the market hovers near its all-time highs. Last but not least, the recent buying frenzy in AI chips could eventually lead to a supply glut if the market finally cools off.\nNvidia faces some long-term challenges, but I believe its strengths still clearly outweigh its weaknesses. Its business is still firing on all cylinders, its margin is expanding, and its stock still looks reasonably valued. Therefore, it's not too late to accumulate more shares of Nvidia if you believe the AI market will continue flourishing over the next few decades.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other fast growth stocks. Recently Baron Funds said the following about NVIDIA Corporation:\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the Fund\u2019s largest position. We believe NVIDIA continues to be at the epicenter of one of the biggest technological paradigm shifts of the last 50 years as computing is shifting from sequential to accelerated and as we begin to see the early stages of the use cases of generative AI (GenAI) enter the mainstream. Is GenAI real? Is it going to be material, sustainable, and disruptive? Will NVIDIA (and other GenAI leaders and disruptors) likely benefit from this disruptive change? Our research suggests that the answer to all of these questions is an unequivocal \u2013 yes\"\nYou can see Baron Funds' entire comments here.\nGrowth stocks are those that are either growing their revenue in mid to high double or triple digit percentages or those who trade at significantly higher prices when compared to their earnings. Using a high P/E ratio is the more commonly accepted definition of growth stocks, and sometimes, investors are richly rewarded for their faith.\nWhile we'll get to the specifics later, there are several stock indexes and exchange traded funds that track growth stocks. Some of the more popular growth stock indexes and ETFs are Vanguard Growth Index Fund Admiral Shares (VIGAX) ETF and the S&P 500 Pure Growth stock index. The performance of these ETFs and indexes depends, for most part, on the economic climate. A well known investment principle is that growth stocks perform well when interest rates are low and consumers and businesses are able to comfortably splurge for pricey products and services.\nYear to date, the Vanguard Growth Index Fund Admiral Shares (VIGAX) and the S&P 500 Pure Growth index are up by 15% and 12%, respectively. This allows the S&P stock index to match the benchmark index in performance, while the Vanguard Fund has gained more since the S&P is up by roughly 12% year to date.\nOver the past twelve months, a period characterized by high but stable interest rates, easing inflation, robust economic growth, and the AI boom, the S&P 500 has gained 27.7%. The index bottomed in October 2023 and so did our ETF and index. The Vanguard ETF is up by 34.9% over the year, and the S&P Pure Growth index has lagged the broader index through its 24% gains. Compare these all around rosy figures with the 32% that the index lost between January 2022 and June 2022 and the additional 32% bled by the ETF and you'll see how growth stocks are sensitive to high rates and inflation.\nTherefore, trying to see where interest rates are heading would also serve one well when talking about fast growth stocks. On this front, one 'proxy' that can be used to gauge investor sentiment is the Russel 2000 index. This is a small cap stock index, and if investors become optimistic about lighter rates, then the shares rise since smaller firms are often more at risk from higher rates than corporate titans.\nSmall-cap stock indices have been relatively flat year to date by having registered an unimpressive 2% in gains. This is unsurprising as the year has seen Wall Street progressively tone down rate cut expectations. However, from mid April to late May, the small caps have gained 6%, so perhaps the winds are changing for interest rates. However, this hasn't been the case, since two of its strongest performing stocks have posted 100%+ in gains. One of these is a fast growth stock when compared to the broader benchmark multiple.\nThis stock is none other than the rather infamous Super Micro. If you're unaware, Super Micro has been caught in the market's artificial intelligence surge too since it is a semiconductor stock. It has a trailing twelve month price to earnings ratio of 49.27 which is high compared to the commonly accepted definition of a growth stock. However, Super Micro's P/E ratio is lower than the semiconductor sector average of 82.75. The market trailing P/E for this data set is 52.28, and it represents 94 sectors. Within these sectors, 26 have a higher trailing P/E ratio than the market ratio, and among these, nearly half have a higher trailing P/E ratio than the semiconductor industry. However, the higher value for semiconductors is a clear example of how artificial intelligence has transformed the market.\nYet, even before AI was a part of daily media coverage, semiconductor stocks had already given us a historic growth story. This comes in the form of the chip designer AMD. AMD's shares are up by a whopping 506% over the past five years, while the S&P 500 has gained 92% during the time period. Despite this stunning growth, the AI onset has led AMD to have a trailing P/E ratio of a whopping 232.51 (forward P/E is 45.66, which is precisely in tune with the sector's 45.77). Between 2010 and 2025, AMD's profitability trend started in 2018, and saw the P/E ratio jump to 515 in early 2023 when earnings took a hit from a glut in the semiconductor industry. AMD's eight cents of EPS in the third quarter of 2023 also meant that as the market bumped its valuation due to AI, the P/E ratio soared 1,285 - making it a classic example of a fast growth stock.\nOur Methodology \nTo make our list of the best fast growth stocks, we first narrowed down the 20 stocks that had the highest trailing P/E ratios and five year and quarter over quarter revenue growth greater than 30%. These were ranked through the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024 according to Insider Monkey's data of hedge fund holdings. Moreover, for each of these stocks, we looked at how many hedge funds from our database held shares according to the last round of 13F filings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 186\nTTM P/E Ratio: 62.12\nAI and semiconductor stock NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) tops our list of the best fast growth stocks, which is unsurprising if we're honest. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have soared by triple digit percentages over the past year, and this has also been the case for its revenue and profit. The latest set of results for the first quarter saw NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) beat analyst revenue estimates of $24.6 billion by posting $26 billion. Adjusted EPS of $6.12 beat analyst estimates of $5.59.\nBy Q1 2024 end, 186 out of the 933 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stakeholders. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners held the largest stake which was worth $12 billion.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks first on our list of the best high growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Click to see the 10 Best Fast Growth Stocks To Buy Now. NVDA is now a $2.8 trillion company and trades at a forward PE of 41. Assuming that its extremely high growth rate continues for a few more years, this is a very cheap stock. This is a big assumption that hedge funds and other investors are betting on right now. The market is assuming that NVDA will earn nearly $70 billion over the next 12 months, $100 billion in 2 years, $150 billion in 3 years, and then grow those profits at high single digits for the foreseeable future (the same rate S&P 500 companies grow their earnings annually). I think the probability of this happening is less than 50% as NVDA needs to defend its moat for a couple of decades which is a very long time in the tech industry. Intel couldn\u2019t defend its moat for two decades and now trades at less than NVDA\u2019s 2026 expected earnings.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: Here's My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Instead",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There is no doubt that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy on the market in the past year-and-a-half thanks to the critical role it is playing in the advancement of this technology.\nAfter all, training large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT wouldn't have been possible without chips from Nvidia. Major cloud computing companies and governments around the globe have been lining up to buy Nvidia's AI graphics processing units (GPUs), leading to outstanding growth in the company's revenue and earnings.\nNVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\nThere is a good chance that Nvidia will be able to sustain the impressive growth that it is posting in its top and bottom lines. That's because the company's dominant position in the AI chip market seems safe considering the technology lead that it enjoys over its rivals. However, there is a chance that investors who aren't comfortable paying for Nvidia's expensive valuation could be seeking alternatives to capitalize on the AI boom.\nNvidia is trading at 75 times trailing earnings. It may be able to justify that valuation by sustaining its red-hot growth, but for investors looking for a cheaper AI stock, The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) could turn out to be a top pick that could be an even better buy than Nvidia. Let's look at the reasons why.\nThe Trade Desk provides a cloud-based, data-driven, programmatic advertising platform to advertisers. This platform allows them to purchase ad inventory from multiple channels, set up, run, and optimize ad campaigns, and serve ads to the right audience on the relevant platform in a cost-efficient manner to increase advertisers' return on investment.\nThe company uses real-time insights and algorithms to ensure that advertisers using its platform can get the most out of their ad dollars. More importantly, The Trade Desk has been leveraging AI to ensure that advertisers get more out of its platform. In 2018, the company launched and started integrating an AI tool known as Koa into its platform. Koa analyzed almost 9 million queries each second \"to help buyers extend audience reach and spend more efficiently.\"\nMore specifically, The Trade Desk claimed that Koa can help advertisers increase their reach by 3 times and reduce costs by 20%. The company released a new AI tool called Kokai last year, utilizing 13 million advertising impressions each second to \"help advertisers buy the right ad impressions, at the right price, to reach the target audience at the best time.\"\nSuch AI-enabled tools are helping The Trade Desk grow at a faster pace than the digital advertising market, and accelerate its growth. For instance, in 2023, the company's revenue increased 23% to $1.95 billion. That was well ahead of the 10.7% growth in digital ad spending last year. More importantly, The Trade Desk's latest results for the first quarter of 2024 suggest that it is winning a bigger share of the digital ad market as its growth is accelerating.\nThe company reported a 28% year-over-year jump in revenue last quarter to $491 million, a nice increase from the 21% year-over-year growth it clocked in the same period last year. The company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin also increased by five percentage points from the year-ago period.\nThe Trade Desk's earnings of $0.26 per share beat the consensus estimate of $0.22 per share. Its revenue was also higher than the expectation of $480 million. Even better, The Trade Desk's revenue guidance of $575 million is higher than the Wall Street forecast of $567 million. The EBITDA forecast of $223 million has also exceeded the $219 million consensus expectation.\nThe company's quarterly revenue forecast would translate into a jump of 23% from the year-ago quarter, while its adjusted EBITDA is on track to increase by a similar figure. It is also worth noting that digital ad spending is estimated to increase by 13.2% in 2024, and the Trade Desk's Q1 growth and Q2 guidance suggest that it is set to grow at a faster pace than the market once again.\nSo, The Trade Desk's strategy of using AI to power its programmatic ad platform is set to help it capture a bigger share of the digital ad market. This should bode well for the company's long-term growth. That's because the digital ad market is forecast to generate $1.15 trillion in annual revenue in 2030, up from $420 billion last year, as per Grand View Research.\nThe Trade Desk, therefore, has a massive addressable opportunity ahead of it, and the fact that it is gaining ground in the digital ad market explains why analysts have been increasing their growth expectations for the company.\nTTD Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\nThe Trade Desk stock is currently trading at 21 times sales, a small discount to its five-year average sales multiple of almost 24. Of course, the sales multiple is higher than the U.S. tech sector's price-to-sales ratio of 7, but The Trade Desk's growing stature in the digital ad market could justify it.\nIf the Trade Desk can maintain its current sales multiple after three years and achieves $3.52 billion in revenue in 2026, as per the chart in the previous paragraph, its market cap could increase to $74 billion. That points toward a jump of 72% from the current level.\nAlso, The Trade Desk is cheaper than Nvidia, which commands a sales multiple of 36. So, investors looking for a relatively cheaper alternative to Nvidia can consider buying The Trade Desk, as it could turn out to be a top AI stock.\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and The Trade Desk wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Fahad Saleem ",
        "Text": "Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 5th in our list of the 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy for 2024 According to Billionaire David Tepper.\nBefore analyzing the stock, let's first see David Tepper's latest returns and his investing strategy for 2024.\nBillionaire David Tepper of Appaloosa Management recently made headlines when his latest portfolio showed the 66-year-old owner of Carolina Panthers was piling into Chinese stocks while clearly cutting his exposure to mega-cap tech stocks which have already rewarded him heftily over the past several quarters, thanks to the AI-led rally. Tepper's bet on Chinese stocks comes at a time when many analysts are predicting a rebound of Chinese economy as the government begins to devise more rescue plans for the devastated property sector. The MSCI China index is up about 10% since the end of March.\nDavid Tepper, who founded Appaloosa Management back in 1993, returned 20% last year, thanks to his huge stake in AI stocks. A cursory analysis of David Tepper, worth over $20 billion, shows that he was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn\u2019t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper's instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he'd joined in 1985.\nTepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the mist of the market crash of 1987. According to The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World's Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:\n\u201cGoing into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short\u2014I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,\u201d he says with a chuckle. \u201cIt was very cool.\u201d Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn\u2019t do as well. \u201cI still got a raise but not as much as I should have.\u201d\nBillionaire David Tepper Q1'2024 Stake Value: $399,373,520\nDavid Tepper piled into Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0when it was just getting started. The billionaire bought 150,000 shares of Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0in the first quarter of 2023 at $216.41 per share. In the very next quarter the billionaire increased his stake in Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0to a whopping one million shares and kept the stake steady through the third quarter of 2023. However, Tepper decreased his stake in Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, ending the March quarter of this year with 442k shares of Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA).\nAppaloosa might be cutting its stake in Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0but other hedge funds are continuing to pile into the stock. Insider Monkey's proprietary database of 919 hedge funds updated for the first quarter of 2024 shows that 186 hedge funds had stakes in Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0as of the end of the March quarter, up from 173 hedge funds in the previous quarter.\nAristotle Atlantic Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) contributed to portfolio performance in the first quarter, as the company continues to see accelerating demand for its GPU semiconductors from hyperscalers and enterprises.

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a Wall Street darling for quite a while now. And for good reason. The stock has roughly tripled over the past 12 months and is up more than sevenfold since September 2022.\nHowever, not everyone on Wall Street remains enthusiastic about Nvidia. One analyst thinks shares of the GPU maker will plunge close to 28% over the next 12 months.\nD.A. Davidson's Gil Luria set a price target of $620 for Nvidia. That reflects expectations of a steep decline from the current share price of around $864.\nWhy is Luria so bearish about the chip stock? He predicts potential trouble ahead due to a shift in spending by big technology companies. In particular, Luria thinks major Nvidia customers including Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft will eventually have all the GPU capacity they need. He told BNN Bloomberg recently that these tech giants won't continue buying chips for generative AI indefinitely at the rate they've been buying.\nAll of these companies have developed their own AI chips. For example, Google announced its new Arm-based Axion chip in April. Meta rolled out the next generation of its custom-made MTIA chip last month as well. Amazon offers cloud customers the option of using its cost-effective Inferentia and Trainium2 chips to run AI apps. Microsoft has its Maia and Cobalt AI chips.\nSome big Nvidia customers have also turned to Nvidia's top rival, Advanced Micro Devices. Meta and Microsoft are buying AMD's new Instinct MI300X chip. AMD claims the chip is better at AI inference than Nvidia's flagship H100 GPU.\nLuria is in the minority on Wall Street. Of the 38 analysts surveyed by LSEG so far in May, 21 rate the stock as either a buy or a strong buy. However, he's not alone in sounding a warning about the risks for Nvidia.\nRichard Hunter, Interactive Investor's head of markets, has expressed concern that Nvidia could become a victim of inflated expectations. He also thinks tensions with China could hurt Nvidia's share price.\nAswath Damodaran, the NYU finance professor known as the \"Dean of Valuation,\" likes Nvidia's business prospects but not its valuation. His model estimated a fair value for the stock of $436 -- close to half the current share price.\nDamodaran posted on X (formerly known as Twitter) that he planned to sell half of his position in Nvidia. He said the stock \"was a bridge too far for me\" because of its premium price.\nCould these negative predictions about Nvidia come true? Will the stock plunge 28% over the next 12 months? Maybe.\nNvidia is subject to the laws of supply and demand like any other business is. If the demand for AI chips slows as Luria expects, Nvidia stock will likely pull back. Luria told BNN Bloomberg, \"The higher we go this year, the more we're going to fall next year, and that's not in the stock.\" While he acknowledged that it could take longer than he predicted, Nvidia's current momentum won't last indefinitely.\nHowever, Nvidia has a strong first-mover advantage in the AI chip market. So far, demand remains strong. I wouldn't place a bet that Nvidia's shares will indeed fall 28% anytime soon. If it does happen, though, I think it will be a fantastic buying opportunity.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "In just the past year, AI chip leader Nvidia has soared more than 200% into the upper echelon of the world's most valuable companies and is already closing in on Microsoft and Apple.\nBut Beth Kindig, lead tech analyst at the I/O Fund, sees more astronomical gains in the coming years, predicting Nvidia's market cap will surge another 270% to $10 trillion. As of Friday's close, the company was worth about $2.7 trillion.\nIn an interview Tuesday on CNBC, she pointed out Nvidia is fueling the AI infrastructure as its chips are in high demand for data centers that train large language models and later this year will release its Blackwell chips, which are expected to outperform the earlier Hopper chips.\nIn addition to hardware, Nvidia's software also gives it an advantage, while the automotive sector will deliver a further boost to the company, Kindig noted.\n\"So we have a lot coming,\" she said. \"This is very, very early for Nvidia, and there's a few layers.\"\nWhile rivals like AMD and Intel have made their own bullish forecasts on the AI market, Kindig said Nvidia will grab the \"lion's share,\" adding that other tech giants developing chips in-house typically do it to optimize their own applications and won't commercialize the chips the way Nvidia does.\nOn the software side, she pointed to Nvidia's CUDA platform, comparing it to Apple's iOS operating system, which helped make the iPhone dominant.\n\"The same thing is happening with Nvidia, which is that the CUDA platform is what software engineers, AI engineers are learning in order to program GPUs,\" Kindig said. \"So that helps lock them in. So that combination, right now, I'm calling an impenetrable moat.\"\nShe has doubled down on a previous forecast for a $10 trillion valuation that she issued earlier this year, when she told RealVision that Nvidia would reach that milestone by 2030.\nSince then, Nvidia has reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates and showed the race toward AI remained robust.\n\u201cThe industry is going through a major change,\u201d CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call last month. \u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun.

        "Title": "Prediction: This Will Be Nvidia's Next Big Announcement",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) never is short on big news. Most recently, the company wowed investors with details of its new Blackwell architecture and said the launch will happen later this year. And prior to this, Nvidia said it aimed to start shipping its H200 graphics processing unit (GPU) -- which doubles the performance of its current chip -- in the second quarter of the year.\nAll of this along with soaring earnings have helped the stock roar higher, climbing more than 200% over the past year. Now, a couple of days ahead of Nvidia's quarterly earnings report, it's logical to wonder about the company's next big announcement. And my prediction is, this time, it may not have to do with an upcoming product. Instead, it may be a move that directly impacts Nvidia's share price...\nSo, as mentioned, Nvidia's stock price has climbed in recent years, and today it's reached more than $940. Some analysts even see it surging well beyond $1,000 within the coming 12 months. It seems very possible considering Nvidia's earnings over the past several quarters. This leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market has reported triple-digit and even quadruple-digit gains in earnings, and growth isn't likely to taper off any time soon.\nThat's because we're in the early days of the AI story, so demand is far from reaching a peak. For example, the percentage of companies mentioning AI on their earnings calls has climbed significantly in recent years -- but it still was only at about 16% last year, according to Goldman Sachs, as quoted by Statista. So there's a lot of room for growth. And forecasts for an AI market worth more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade further support the idea of more growth to come.\nNvidia, in its forecast for the fiscal 2025 first quarter, has said it expects to report $24 billion in revenue -- representing yet another triple-digit increase in revenue year over year. And along with this and other news during Wednesday's earnings report, the company may make a big announcement directly related to share price.\nI predict Nvidia may launch a stock split, a move that lowers the price of each individual share without changing the overall market value of the company. Companies do this by issuing additional shares to current holders.\nStock splits themselves aren't catalysts for share performance, but they can be positive for a company over time as they do make it easier for smaller investors to get in on a particular stock. The price of $1,000 for a stock represents a psychological barrier for some investors -- who automatically consider the price too high even if the actual valuation remains reasonable. And some investors don't have access to fractional shares or prefer buying full shares, pushing a $1,000 stock beyond their reach.\nNow, let's consider Nvidia's stock split history, which shows the company is open to such moves. Nvidia has completed five stock splits over the past two decades, and on each occasion the stock was trading much lower than today's level. So it seems possible that now, with the stock approaching $1,000 and plenty of growth on the horizon to trigger additional gains, Nvidia would consider a new stock split.\nShould you wait for a potential split to buy Nvidia or get in on the stock right now? The great news is you can do either.

        "Text": "Supercomputers in Germany, Japan and Poland Incorporate Grace-Hopper and Quantum-Classical Accelerated Supercomputing Platform to Advance Quantum Computing Research\nNVIDIA quantum computing\nHAMBURG, Germany, May 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ISC -- NVIDIA today announced that it will accelerate quantum computing efforts at national supercomputing centers around the world with the open-source NVIDIA CUDA-Q\u2122 platform.\nSupercomputing sites in Germany, Japan and Poland will use the platform to power the quantum processing units (QPUs) inside their NVIDIA-accelerated high-performance computing systems.\nQPUs are the brains of quantum computers that use the behavior of particles like electrons or photons to calculate differently than traditional processors, with the potential to make certain types of calculations faster.\nGermany\u2019s J\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) at Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich is installing a QPU built by IQM Quantum Computers as a complement to its JUPITER supercomputer, supercharged by the NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper\u2122 Superchip.\nThe ABCI-Q supercomputer, located at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Japan, is designed to advance the nation\u2019s quantum computing initiative. Powered by the NVIDIA Hopper\u2122 architecture, the system will add a QPU from QuEra.\nPoland\u2019s Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PSNC) has recently installed two photonic QPUs, built by ORCA Computing, connected to a new supercomputer partition accelerated by NVIDIA Hopper.\n\u201cUseful quantum computing will be enabled by the tight integration of quantum with GPU supercomputing,\u201d said Tim Costa, director of quantum and HPC at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s quantum computing platform equips pioneers such as AIST, JSC and PSNC to push the boundaries of scientific discovery and advance the state of the art in quantum-integrated supercomputing.\u201d\nThe QPU integrated with ABCI-Q will enable researchers at AIST to investigate quantum applications in AI, energy and biology, utilizing Rubidium atoms controlled by laser light as qubits to perform calculations. These are the same type of atoms used in precision atomic clocks. Each atom is identical, providing a promising method of achieving a large-scale, high-fidelity quantum processor.\n\u201cJapan\u2019s researchers will make progress toward practical quantum computing applications with the ABCI-Q quantum-classical accelerated supercomputer,\u201d said Masahiro Horibe, deputy director of G-QuAT/AIST. \u201cNVIDIA is helping these pioneers push the boundaries of quantum computing research.\u201d\nPSNC\u2019s QPUs will enable researchers to explore biology, chemistry and machine learning with two PT-1 quantum photonics systems. The systems use single photons, or packets of light, at telecom frequencies as qubits. This allows for a distributed, scalable and modular quantum architecture using standard, off-the-shelf telecom components.\n\u201cOur collaboration with ORCA and NVIDIA has allowed us to create a unique environment and build a new quantum-classical hybrid system at PSNC,\u201d said Krzysztof Kurowski, CTO and deputy director of PSNC. \u201cThe open, easy integration and programming of multiple QPUs and GPUs efficiently managed by user-centric services is critical for developers and users. This close collaboration paves the way for a new generation of quantum-accelerated supercomputers for many innovative application areas, not tomorrow, but today.\u201d\nThe QPU integrated with JUPITER will enable JSC researchers to develop quantum applications for chemical simulations and optimization problems as well as demonstrate how classical supercomputers can be accelerated by quantum computers. It is built with superconducting qubits, or electronic resonant circuits, that can be manufactured to behave as artificial atoms at low temperatures.\n\u201cQuantum computing is being brought closer by hybrid quantum-classical accelerated supercomputing,\u201d said Kristel Michielsen, head of the quantum information processing group at JSC. \u201cThrough our ongoing collaboration with NVIDIA, JSC\u2019s researchers will advance the fields of quantum computing as well as chemistry and material science.\u201d\nBy tightly integrating quantum computers with supercomputers, CUDA-Q also enables quantum computing with AI to solve problems such as noisy qubits and develop efficient algorithms.\nCUDA-Q is an open-source and QPU-agnostic quantum-classical accelerated supercomputing platform. It is used by the majority of the companies deploying QPUs and delivers\u00a0best-in-class performance.\nAbout NVIDIANVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nFor further information, contact:Alex ShapiroPublic RelationsNVIDIA Corporation+1-415-608-5044ashapiro@nvidia.com\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance, and availability of our products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform, NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, and NVIDIA Hopper architecture; NVIDIA accelerating quantum computing efforts at national supercomputing centers around the world with the open-source NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform; third parties using and adopting our technologies and products, our collaboration with third parties and the benefits and impact thereof, and the features, performance and availability of their offerings; useful quantum computing being enabled by the tight integration of quantum with GPU supercomputing; QPU integrated with ABCI-Q enabling researchers at AIST to investigate quantum applications in AI, energy and biology, utilizing Rubidium atoms controlled by laser light as qubits to perform calculations; and Japan\u2019s researchers making progress toward practical quantum computing applications with the ABCI-Q quantum-classical accelerated supercomputer are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

        "Title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock?",
        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) once again demonstrated why it is a top semiconductor stock. Last week, it delivered the report for its fiscal 2025's first quarter (which ended April 30), revealing triple-digit percentage revenue growth for yet another quarter and insatiable demand for its most powerful chips.\nThe stock price boost inspired by those results has taken its market cap to about $2.6 trillion, a 230% yearly rise. In the wake of such an increase, many investors who haven't already bought in must wonder whether they have missed the boat, or whether they can still profit from this remarkable growth story. Let's see.\nNvidia is spearheading what it calls the next industrial revolution.\nAs late as the end of fiscal 2022, most of the company's revenue had come from gaming. However, by that time, Nvidia had spent many years developing graphics processing units (GPUs) for both gaming and data centers. Thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning, it increased the speed and capabilities of its processors while making itself an AI innovator.\nWhen the public debut of ChatGPT sparked a wave of demand for generative AI, tech companies -- and investors -- discovered that 10,000 of Nvidia's most powerful GPUs were providing the computing power to support the model. That revelation caused demand for its AI-capable chips to surge to unprecedented levels.\nRivals began developing competing AI chips. AMD released its MI300 line, claiming it was faster than Nvidia's H100 and upcoming H200 GPUs. But customers seem to have dismissed such assertions, and Nvidia continues to innovate. Nvidia said its latest platform, dubbed Blackwell, can run trillion-parameter large language models at as little as 4% of the cost and energy consumption of its Hopper platform.\nAnd the company asserts that the cost savings for some other computationally intensive applications are even greater. Such advances show Nvidia's determination to remain the leader in the AI chip business. With a market share of at least 80%, its dominance is unlikely to end anytime soon.\nThe fiscal Q1 2025 report appears to confirm the chipmaker's market leadership. In the period, revenue rose 262% year over year to $26 billion. Almost $23 billion of that came from the data center segment, where revenue rose 427%. That's a dramatic change for a company that earned the majority of its revenue from selling into the gaming market until two years ago.\nDuring that time, operating expenses climbed by only 39%. Consequently, its net income of $15 billion increased 628% over the previous year.\nAmid these results, Nvidia stock surged past the $1,000 per share mark. That prompted the company to approve a 10-for-1 stock split, effective June 7. It last split 4-for-1 in July 2021.\nThose share price gains elevated Nvidia's valuation, but it may not be as high as some assume. Its P/E ratio of 87 is not cheap, but with a profit growth rate well into the triple-digit percentages, that may not deter investors. Its forward P/E ratio of 38 seems to confirm this value proposition. Although Nvidia has logged some impressive gains, its climb could still have a long way to go.\nConsidering the high demand for its AI-capable chips and valuation, it is likely not too late to buy Nvidia. It has benefited from unprecedented growth, and since demand for its AI chips far exceeds the supply, it should continue growing its revenue and profits rapidly, and the stock appears poised to move higher for the foreseeable future.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Radek Strnad ",
        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 11.2% in the afternoon session after the company reported first quarter earnings results. Nvidia recorded healthy gross margin improvement, indicating elevated pricing power. Its revenue and EPS outperformed Wall Street's estimates, driven by better-than-expected results in its data center and automotive segments; the result in its automotive segment (17% year-on-year revenue growth) was especially impressive given the industry is in a cyclical downturn and many other semiconductor companies have posted year-on-year declines for that end market. Lastly, its inventory levels increased, likely due to the company stocking up on products in anticipation of strong demand.\nDuring the announcement of the results, Nvidia issued a 10-1 stock split that will commence on Friday, June 7, 2024. Looking ahead, Nvidia's revenue for the next quarter beat expectations again. Overall, this was a great quarter that shareholders will appreciate.\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 11 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Nvidia and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 22 days ago, when the company dropped 5.9% on the news that peer, AMD reported reported first quarter results which highlighted a material increase in its inventory levels. In addition, AMD's guidance for the next quarter was underwhelming as revenue projection was mostly in line with Wall Street's projections.\nSuper Micro Computer, another beneficiary of the current AI wave, reported underwhelming earnings as revenue fell below Wall Street's expectations, with the company calling out supply chain challenges. Like AMD, Super Micro provides data center infrastructure (servers, GPUs, and storage solutions) that power AI models. These include customized cooling racks that enable AI models to deliver better performance.\nOverall, the underwhelming results and mixed outlook provided by these semiconductor players suggest the era of hypergrowth that has propelled the valuation of some of the leading innovators in the AI space might be cooling off as investors become increasingly cautious.\nNvidia is up 121% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $28,848.\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

The biggest question for investors now is whether this dominance can be sustained and for how long.\nWhile NVIDIA's GPUs are unmatched for training AI models, chips from competitors like Intel and AMD can be used for inference after models are trained.\nNVIDIA appears to have a strong position in the inference market as well, but it could face increased competition in the coming years. Additionally, large technology companies are designing their own chips, potentially reducing their reliance on NVIDIA.\nNVIDIA's chips are already significantly ahead of the competition, with the company planning to launch even more improved chips annually.\nWhat truly sets NVIDIA apart is its comprehensive AI ecosystem, which includes its CUDA software and leading networking technology.\nNVIDIA has invested heavily in CUDA for over almost two decades, and boasts the best chip networking technology thanks to its acquisition of Mellanox in 2019.\nAny rival aiming to gain dominance in the industry will need to develop best-in-class hardware, software, and networking technology, a significant challenge.\nFurthermore, NVIDIA has access to a large share of TSMC's TSM advanced manufacturing capabilities, making it difficult for competitors to secure similar allocations.\nPlease watch the short video to learn more.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Just five years ago, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) share price was less than $50. But since then, the leading maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) has found new markets for its chip technology, namely around artificial intelligence (AI), fueling incredible growth for the business. This AI hype has led investors to bid up Nvidia's share price to about $925 to account for the company's surging revenue and growth prospects.\nUltimately, what determines whether a share price goes up or down long term is the growth, or lack thereof, of a company's revenue and profits.\nAnd if Nvidia continues to see this unprecedented demand for its GPUs, the stock could climb even higher.\nFor a long time, Nvidia primarily sold its GPUs for professional graphics artists and video gamers. But these powerful processors, originally intended to render graphically demanding applications, are also suited to training AI models like OpenAI's famous ChatGPT.\nNvidia's annual revenue has increased nearly 500% over the last five years, mostly driven by its data center business.\nData center revenue, which now makes up 83% of the top line, grew an astounding 409% year over year in the company's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. Management expects total revenue to increase another 234% year over year in its fiscal 2025 first quarter.\nIt's unheard of for a company reporting over $60 billion in annual revenue to put up growth rates like this, but enterprise spending on data centers is projected to increase substantially in the coming years. Cloud service providers are investing heavily in the infrastructure needed to provide AI-related services to their customers, and CEO Jensen Huang said earlier this year that the existing $1 trillion of data centers will likely double to $2 trillion before 2030.\nBecause Nvidia dominates the market for GPUs, in addition to supplying many other components necessary to build these data centers, it's not hard to see the company maintaining its current momentum going forward.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have gotten off to red-hot starts so far in 2024, with each index already boasting double-digit returns.\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that one of the biggest tailwinds fueling the capital markets right now is artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, a collective of megacap tech businesses known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" have enjoyed some of the biggest gains so far this year.\nWithin the Magnificent Seven, shares of semiconductor company Nvidia are already up a sizzling 123% in 2024. A return of this magnitude might imply that investors just can't get enough of Nvidia, and perhaps it's too late to enjoy the ride.\nBut savvy investors understand that there are many other opportunities besides Nvidia in the chip market. Brad Gerstner is a hedge fund manager who founded the investment firm Altimeter Capital.\nAccording to Altimeter's most recent filings, Gerstner actually trimmed his position in Nvidia by a nominal 6,515 shares during the first quarter. Moreover, Gerstner initiated a new position in a different semiconductor company, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO).\nLet's explore how Broadcom is performing, and what makes it a compelling opportunity for long-term investors interested in AI.\nNot all semiconductor businesses are the same. Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices focus on the design aspects of graphics processing units (GPUs) used for generative AI applications. However, both of these companies outsource the manufacturing process of their chips to fabrication specialists like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\nRight now, I'd wager that the aspects of the semiconductor industry experiencing the most demand are chipmakers and data center service providers. Fortunately for Nvidia, the company sits at the intersection of both of these areas -- hence the company is witnessing record sales and profit growth each quarter.\nWhile this is encouraging for Nvidia investors, diversifying your exposure to semiconductors more broadly may be a good idea. The reason? As time goes on, other aspects of the chip space will begin to see some momentum beyond just buying chips or data center services.\nBroadcom specializes in network infrastructure.\nIf you've ever used a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT, you might notice that the answers to your prompts occasionally experience delays or stall out, resulting in an error message. The simple explanation for this is that LLMs process enormous amounts of data.\nMoreover, depending on the sophistication of your input (the prompt entered into the LLM), the model may require strong network connectivity in order to complete the task. Broadcom specializes in this process. In other words, while Broadcom is not the poster child of the latest generative AI model, the company's expertise plays a major role behind the scenes relating to performance.\nIn addition to ChatGPT, some of the more commonly used LLMs include Alphabet's Gemini, Meta Platforms' Llama, and Amazon's Claude. While the pros and cons of each model are up for debate, all of them are fairly new. Given their nascency and the fact that big tech is still very much in the research and development stage of commercializing these products, Broadcom's services remain slightly protracted at the moment.\nHowever, according to Research and Markets, the global addressable market for network and switching AI data center solutions is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38% between 2024 and 2029 -- reaching $19.4 billion by the end of the decade.\nAs secular tailwinds continue fueling the overall AI narrative, Broadcom's business should begin to see an uptick in demand as network connectivity continues to be a major source for data centers.\nThe chart below illustrates the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for a number of different types of chip businesses. With a P/E of 52, Broadcom is valued at a premium compared to many peers. This could suggest that there is a bullish undercurrent surrounding network solutions.\nA prudent approach to investing in Broadcom would be to use dollar-cost averaging. This strategy will allow you to buy shares over a long-term time horizon at varying prices. As a result, you can monitor Broadcom's growth curve over time, and benefit from opening a position during a period of outsize momentum.\nWhile shares of Broadcom are indeed a bit pricey, I wouldn't balk at the valuation. AI is still very much in its early chapters, and I think Broadcom's role in the overall AI realm is still being uncovered.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia's (NVDA) highly anticipated earnings release delivered. The company's financial metrics blew past Wall Street's expectations, sending shares soaring nearly 20% in the three days after its earnings release.\nBut the widespread stock market rally many thought would follow didn't happen. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is now off more than 0.5% since the chipmaker's earnings release after the closing bell on May 22. To Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel, this brings an end to a yearlong trend of Nvidia's stock moves driving the market higher.\n\"NVDA no longer being 'The Stock That Is The Market' will likely end the market\u2019s low volatility 'hush' of the past two weeks,\" Emanuel warned in a note to clients on Wednesday.\nThe S&P 500 has slipped from record highs since the Nvidia earnings release as investor focus has shifted elsewhere. Stocks slid despite a 10% surge in Nvidia shares the day after the company's earnings release as a hotter-than-expected reading on economic output had investors scaling back their expectations for interest rate cuts this year. That trend has continued this week as a rise in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) to its highest level since the start of May helped drive a decline in the S&P 500 over the same period.\nEmanuel, who holds one of the lowest year-end targets for the S&P 500 on Wall Street at 4,750, noted that a stock with a top-five weighting in the S&P 500 has never surged 20% in the three days after earnings with the index not also ending that time period higher. So, the most recent divergence in directions is starkly different from Nvidia's near-perfect correlation with the S&P 500 over the past year, per Emanuel, and could mean the market is poised for a pullback.\n\"There is no precedent for a stock of NVDA\u2019s size having its post-earnings share surge 'ignored' by the broader S&P 500,\" Emanuel wrote. \"This divergence is a catalyst for greater movement at the S&P 500 level in front of other event catalysts.\"\nEmanuel listed upcoming inflation prints such as Friday's Personal Consumption Expenditures index release and the June Federal Reserve meeting as examples.\nEmanuel pointed out that Nvidia's decoupling from the market comes as large-cap stocks as a whole have become less correlated with each other as of late. At a reading of about 12 on Tuesday in the CBOE Implied Correlation Index (^COR3M), Emanuel noted that the correlation among large-cap stocks was among \"the lowest observations ever.\"\nPrior correlation troughs similar to this have corresponded with stock pullbacks like the three-month retreat that started in August 2023. In most cases, a 10% correction in stocks has followed, per Emanuel. His base case remains a mid-year pullback \"consistent with the aftermath of correlation troughs.\"\nMore broadly, other strategists have pointed to the end of a positive earnings season as a reason market action could be bumpy in the coming weeks as investor focus shifts to economic data amid an uncertain interest rate path for the Federal Reserve.\nTruist Co-CIO Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance this shift in investor focus makes for a \"more volatile market.\"\n\"Our underlying message is we still think the primary trend is higher,\" Lerner said. \"Near-term the market will be searching for a catalyst, which likely means we're in more of a choppy period.\"\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Among the biggest gainers were server makers Super Micro Computer Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc., which climbed more than 8%. Chipmakers Broadcom Inc., Marvell Technology Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. also rose.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a technology revolution and still in the early days of it,\u201d Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder, said after Nvidia\u2019s results. \u201cIt is really hard to not be positive right now, especially on Nvidia.\u201d\nShares of semiconductor companies that are suppliers to Nvidia got a boost during the Asian trading day. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the maker of Nvidia\u2019s chips, advanced to a record high while South Korea\u2019s SK Hynix Inc., which supplies high-bandwidth memory to the US chipmaker, also rose. Japan\u2019s Advantest Corp. jumped 5.4%. The Bloomberg Asia Pacific Semiconductors Index reached the highest level in more than three years.\nNvidia\u2019s postmarket gain sent the stock above $1,000 for the first time. If the advance holds on Thursday, the chipmaker is set to add more than $100 billion in market value and push the stock\u2019s rise for 2024 over 100%.\nHelping to fuel Nvidia\u2019s rally was its announcement of a 10-for-1 stock split that the company said was aimed at making shares more accessible to employees and investors. The split would be Nvidia\u2019s second in the past three years, with the stock climbing more than 500% since the last one was announced in May 2021.\nOf course, stock splits have no fundamental effect on share value.

        "Title": "NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n See our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt in January 2024, down from US$11.0b, one year before. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$26.0b in cash, so it actually has US$16.3b net cash.\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$10.6b due within a year, and liabilities of US$12.1b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$26.0b in cash and US$10.00b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has US$13.2b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nThis state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$2.04t company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\nBetter yet, NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 489% last year, which is an impressive improvement. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 80% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that NVIDIA has net cash of US$16.3b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. The cherry on top was that in converted 80% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$27b. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for NVIDIA  you should be aware of.\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.NVIDIA\u2019s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company\u2019s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.NVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company\u2019s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company\u2019s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.Santa Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024, up 126% from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023.Beginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments \u2013 Graphics and Compute & Networking.Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.Compute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.Graphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 22% and 78% of fiscal 2024 revenues, respectively.\nBottom Line\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Nvidia, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\nA $1000 investment made in May 2014 would be worth $201,950.68, or a gain of 20,095.07%, as of May 7, 2024, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\nThe S&P 500 rose 177.38% and the price of gold increased 70.50% over the same time frame in comparison.\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for NVDA.\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVIDIA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 29.1% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.75%, and there have been 6 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Before the Q1 2024 earnings call on May 22, 2024 when the split was announced, NVDA closed at $949.50. Since, the stock has reached all-time highs, breaching the $1,150 mark. While the split price will officially take effect June 10, 2024, investors need to own shares by market close (4pm ET) on June 6, 2024 to be issued new shares in the split.\nManagement also announced a 150% increase in cash dividends \u2013 from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share \u2013 which will ultimately yield a $0.01 per share dividend on the post-split shares. Here's what investors need to know about receiving split shares and dividends from Nvidia.\nStay up to date on news affecting Nvidia and other potential investments with the Market Minute Newsletter.\nNvidia's upcoming stock split comes after a roughly 5x in stock price since the last split, which began trading June 21, 2021.\u00a0 Investors won't receive any additional value or voting power, but allow greater flexibility for employees and retail investors to invest in the company with more accessible pricing. Usually, a stock split is viewed by investors as a bullish signal, under the premise that management sees a promising financial future for the company, though it does not represent a material change in company operations.\nJune 6, 2024, 4pm ET: Own shares of $NVDA by this time to be issued shares at the time of split.\nJuly 7, 2024, 4pm ET: This is the last day of trading for contemporary float (number of shares) and share price.

But recent data hadn't \"increased\" confidence, and therefore, they believed \"the disinflation process would likely take longer than previously thought.\"\nAlso in the minutes, various participants mentioned a \"willingness\" to tighten policy \"should risks to inflation materialize in a way that such an action became appropriate.\"\nMarkets hit their lows of the day following the release with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) falling about 0.4%.\nTarget (TGT) stock dropped more than 6% as comparable sales declined more than estimated in the prior quarter.

But, there is still a long way to go,\u201d Buttigieg said.\nHe added, \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s all about the results. They are saying the right things. They are taking encouraging steps. But we need to make sure that we see it on the shop floor, that we see it in terms of the quality of the product that rolls off the line. That\u2019s why the FAA is taking this extraordinary step of not permitting them to increase their production rate until they have shown beyond a doubt that they can safely address those quality issues and increase that production in a way that is consistent with the quality that everybody expects from such an important company and producer in the United States.\u201d\nYou can watch our interview with Transportation Secretary Buttigieg below.\nLululemon (LULU) shares fell nearly 7%, hitting their lowest intraday level since March 2023, as the company announced the departure of chief product officer Sun Choe.\nWedbush analyst Tom Nikic reasoned Choe was an \"instrumental part in LULU's success over the past 7+ years,\" and the initial decline in shares made sense.\nThe move puts shares of LULU down about 40% this year as sentiment has soured around the stock amid competition from companies like Alo and Vuori.

The stock has fallen more than 90% since that time.\nThe disclosure of the stake raises more questions about BuzzFeed's strategic direction. Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old biotech entrepreneur, endorsed Donald Trump after dropping out of the presidential race in January following the Iowa caucuses. He has built a reputation as an \"anti-woke\" activist opposed to corporate involvement in social and environmental causes.\nIn the past year, BuzzFeed has undergone major changes in an attempt to reach profitability.\nBuzzFeed announced plans to shutter its news division and slash 15% of staffers, or about 180 employees, in April 2023. Earlier this year, the company said it would cut an additional 16% of its workforce \"to reduce centralized costs and to allow the company to become more agile, sustainable, and profitable.\"\nAlong with layoffs, BuzzFeed also sold digital media company Complex Networks, which it acquired in 2021 for about $300 million, to live video shopping platform NTWRK in a $108.6 million all-cash deal. BuzzFeed received approximately $5.7 million in severance and office-related charges on top of the purchase price.\nLast week, the company reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.3 million in the first quarter but said it expects adjusted EBITDA to come in the range of a $4 million loss to $1 million profit in the current quarter, \"approximately flat year-over-year at the midpoint.\"\nUS stocks hovered near record highs on Wednesday as investors waited for AI bellwether Nvidia's (NVDA) pivotal earnings and for more clues to the Federal Reserve's thinking on interest rate cuts.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) popped nearly 0.1%.\nMarkets meandered in the wait to find out whether Nvidia will deliver on sky-high earnings expectations. Investors are bracing for a big move in the chipmaker's share price and in other potential AI plays after the first quarter results, set for release after the bell. It all adds up to a big test for the broader market as a whole.\nTop trending ticker on the Yahoo Finance platform this morning: Target (TGT).\nAnd that says a lot considering it's Nvidia (NVDA) earnings day!\nShares of the retailer are getting pounded by 8% premarket after an earnings miss and cautious guidance. My full breakdown of the quarter here. I will be on Yahoo Finance at 9 a.m. ET with more details, so tune in.\nI will add a little more context here, however.\nI was on a reporter call with Target chairman and CEO Brian Cornell discussing the results. There was talk of inflation cooling down, but his commentary stopped short of saying that sales were growing again because of a slower pace of inflation.\nTo the Target bulls out there \u2014 and there are many \u2014 that's a problem.\nIt's almost showtime for Nvidia (NVDA), with earnings out after the close today.\nIt could be a wild 48 hours in markets because of this one stock.\nCurrent premiums in options markets imply that traders are bracing for an 8.6% swing in the stock price in either direction, reports the Financial Times this morning.\nIf Nvidia does react negatively to the results and guidance, it will be hard to shake the bull case on the stock, most on the Street say.\n\"Even if there is weakness from some unforeseen force in the near-term, we see limited stock weakness as investors want to keep or add to positions for second half Blackwell [new AI chip] growth,\" Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar said in a note this morning.\nGame on.\nYahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley previews Nvidia's results here.\nGoldman Sachs just served up a new piece of research that will likely be eaten up by politicians who love talking about the country's ballooning debt.\nThe bank's economics team lifted its debt-to-GDP ratio to 130% by 2034, up from 97% in projections published in 2019.\n\"The outlook for US fiscal sustainability has become more challenging over the last five years. The primary deficit \u2014 the deficit excluding interest costs on the debt \u2014 remains roughly 5% of GDP wider than it has been historically at full employment, the debt-to-GDP ratio has risen 19 percentage points to 98% and will likely soon surpass the post-WW2 high, and interest rates on new Treasury debt have roughly doubled. Higher expected future interest rates in particular have substantially worsened the trajectories of the debt-to-GDP ratio and of real interest expense as a share of GDP,\" said Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius.\nThe unsavory chart is below.\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 22, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +406.4%.\nRevenues are expected to be $24.27 billion, up 237.5% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.93% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nvidia?\nFor Nvidia, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.90%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.\nSo, this combination indicates that Nvidia will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of $4.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.16, delivering a surprise of +13.41%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nNvidia appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "In the latest market close, Nvidia (NVDA) reached $905.54, with a -1.72% movement compared to the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.13%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.08%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.1%.\nShares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence witnessed a gain of 5.75% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 0.89% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.35%.\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Nvidia in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on May 22, 2024. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $5.49, showcasing a 403.67% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $24.17 billion, indicating a 236.08% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $23.94 per share and a revenue of $106.05 billion, representing changes of +84.72% and +74.07%, respectively, from the prior year.\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Nvidia. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.44% higher. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nIn terms of valuation, Nvidia is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 38.49. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 23.1, so one might conclude that Nvidia is trading at a premium comparatively.\nMeanwhile, NVDA's PEG ratio is currently 1.24. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Semiconductor - General stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.74 based on yesterday's closing prices.\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 215, positioning it in the bottom 15% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Better Stock-Split Buy: Nvidia or Chipotle?",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Step aside, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG). There's a more heavily anticipated stock split on the way now. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced in its first-quarter update last week that it plans to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split effective June 7, 2024. Chipotle's board of directors approved a 50-for-1 stock split in March that's expected to take effect on June 26, 2024.\nNvidia has been the bigger winner by far so far this year. The GPU maker's shares have skyrocketed more than 125% compared to a gain of more than 35% for Chipotle. But which is the better stock-split buy now: Nvidia or Chipotle?\nFirst things first: Forget about the stock splits. I know many investors get excited about them and I led off this article talking about them, but they're practically meaningless.\nSure, both Nvidia and Chipotle stocks will soon sport lower share prices. And maybe this will entice some retail investors to buy. The reality, though, is that anyone who wanted to invest less the price of one share in Nvidia and Chipotle could have already done so. How? Many online brokers offer the opportunity to buy fractional shares of top stocks.\nAnother factor to consider is that stock splits don't always provide nice catalysts for a stock's price. And when they do, the gains are often temporary.\nMost importantly, though, stock splits change nothing about a company's underlying business. Stock splits merely increase the number of outstanding shares and lower the price of each share. That's it.\nNonetheless, the upcoming stock splits for Nvidia and Chipotle could stoke interest in both stocks. How do they stack up against each other? Let's start with each company's financial position.\nNvidia reported Q1 revenue of $26 billion, up 262% over the result in the prior-year period. The company posted a profit of nearly $15 billion, soaring 628% year over year. Nvidia's cash stockpile topped $31.4 billion as of April 28.\nChipotle's Q1 revenue jumped 14.1% year over year to $2.7 billion. Its earnings rose 13.3% to $359.3 million. The restaurant operator had cash and cash equivalents totaling nearly $727.4 million as of March 31.\nMoving on to growth prospects, Wall Street expects Nvidia's earnings will grow by nearly 43% annually on average over the next five years. Analysts look for Chipotle's earnings to increase by around 22% annually during the same period.\nWhat about valuation? Nvidia's shares trade at a lofty 41.5 times forward earnings estimates. However, the stock's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a more reasonable 1.35. Meanwhile, Chipotle's forward earnings multiple of 58.8 and PEG ratio of 2.72 are even higher than Nvidia's multiples.\nI doubt that income investors will find either stock appealing. However, Nvidia does offer a dividend whereas Chipotle doesn't. Nvidia also recently announced a 150% increase to its dividend payout.\nThis decision appears to be an easy one. Nvidia's financials are more impressive than Chipotle's. The giant chipmaker has stronger growth prospects. Its valuation is more attractive. Nvidia even offers a small dividend. It's the hands-down winner, in my view.\nJust because Nvidia is a better pick than Chipotle, though, doesn't automatically make it the best stock to buy right now. As great as Nvidia is, I think other stocks could be even bigger winners over the next few years. These stocks might not have stock splits on the way, but that doesn't matter one bit.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Let's time-travel back a decade. On April 29, 2014, Disney's Captain America: The Winter Soldier\u00a0was the U.S. monthly box-office champ, Tesla had just begun delivering its Model S cars to China, and Activision Blizzard (now owned by Microsoft) was two days away from revealing its videogame Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.\nThe above paragraph was meant not only to take you back in time but also to give you an idea of the diversity of artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) customers. All the companies mentioned use Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) for various applications.\nWith the stage set, let's answer the question: How much money would your Nvidia stock investment be worth now had you invested $5,000 in the stock a decade ago?\nHad you invested $5,000 in Nvidia stock on April 29, 2014, your investment would be worth about $990,485, as of April 29, 2024. This amount assumes you reinvested the modest dividends Nvidia pays. For context, the S&P 500 index (widely considered the best proxy for the broad U.S. stock market) would have turned your 5 grand into $16,410 over the same period.\nNow, let's dive into what drove Nvidia stock to its fantastic return over the last 10 years.\nNvidia was founded in 1993 and went public in 1999. So, a decade ago, it had been in business for 21 years and publicly traded for 15 years. On April 29, 2014, Nvidia stock closed at a split-adjusted price of $4.67 per share. Its closing price was $4.43 when adjusted for both stock splits (Nvidia has had five stock splits) and dividends.\nBelow is what Nvidia's business looked like in the quarter reported about a decade ago and in its most recently reported quarter.\nMetric/Topic\nQ4 Fiscal 2014 (Ended Late Jan. 2014)\nQ4 Fiscal 2024 (Ended Late Jan. 2024)\nGrowth\nRevenue\n$1.14 billion\n$22.10 billion\n1,839%\nAdjusted net income\n$187 million\n$12.84 billion\n6,766%\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS)\n$0.08*\n$5.16\n6,350%\nBusiness snapshot\nBulk of revenue came from gaming and professional visualization (pro viz) markets**\nRevenue breakdown by platform: 83% data center, 13% gaming, 2% pro viz, 1% auto\nN/A\nData source: Nvidia. *Reported result was $0.32. This number is adjusted for the 4-for-1 stock split in 2021. **Nvidia didn't break out its revenue at this time in the same way it does now.\nNvidia's revenue has grown tremendously. Its 1,839% revenue growth over the decade equates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 35%. Even better, its profits have soared at a much faster pace. Its 10-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6,350% equates to a nearly 52% CAGR.\nNvidia's data center platform has been the company's biggest growth driver over the last 10 years. It's more profitable than the company's overall business, which is why Nvidia's earnings have been rising significantly faster than its revenue over the last decade.\nThe data center platform's growth is being fueled by the rapid adoption of AI by companies and other entities. Nvidia is a huge beneficiary of this trend because it's the dominant supplier of AI chips for data centers. In the company's most recently reported quarter (fiscal Q4 2024), its total revenue surged 265% year over year, while its data center revenue skyrocketed 409%.\nNvidia's data center business had been growing at a fast clip for some time, but its growth exploded starting in calendar year 2023, thanks to generative AI. This new technology burst onto the scene in late 2022 when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot. Demand for this tech is so robust because it expands the potential applications of AI.\nAI is still in its relatively early innings. It's not too late to consider buying Nvidia stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "NVIDIA NVDA reported exceptional first-quarter fiscal 2025 results, surpassing all expectations. Its data center revenues skyrocketed 427% year-over-year to $22.6 billion, fueled by the rapid adoption of AI technologies.\nMicrosoft MSFT, Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet GOOGL accounted for around 45% of the company\u2019s data center revenue.\nInvestors cheered CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s comments regarding their latest chip, Blackwell. \u201cWe will see a lot of Blackwell revenue this year.\u201d NVIDIA will launch new chips on an annual cycle.\nThe stock will start trading on a split-adjusted basis at market open on June 10. The split doesn\u2019t change the company's underlying value but can make it more appealing to retail investors. Moreover, it could be included in the price-weighted Dow after the split.\nNVIDIA currently controls over 80% of the market for cutting-edge chips used to train and run large language models. Tech giants as well as AI startups have been frantically acquiring as many NVIDIA chips as they can.\nThe chip maker is seen as a big beneficiary of the funding into Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence start-up, which raised $6 billion in its latest venture round on Sunday.\nWhile NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are unmatched for training AI models, chips from other companies like INTC and AMD AMD can be used for inference after models are trained.\nNVIDIA also appears to have a dominant position in the inference market, but it could face competition in the coming years. Additionally, large technology companies are designing their own chips, which could reduce their reliance on NVIDIA.\nHowever, what really sets NVIDIA apart from peers is its AI ecosystem, which includes its CUDA software and networking technology. Further, the company has access to a large share of TSMC's TSM advanced manufacturing capabilities, and competitors may find it difficult to secure similar allocations.\nThanks to the surge in demand for its AI chips, NVIDIA's shares have risen more than 120% this year, following a nearly 240% increase in 2023. However, its valuation does not seem overstretched, as earnings are growing faster than its share price.\nNVIDIA\u2019s meteoric surge has drawn some investors to single-stock ETFs that aim to double its daily return. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF NVDL has about $2.4 billion in assets, and the T-Rex 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF NVDX has gathered about $411 million.\nI think these instruments can be effectively used as short-term tactical trading tools before or after earnings. However, investors should remember that these products are not meant for buy-and-hold investing and should be used only by those who closely monitor their portfolios.\nChip ETFs, like the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH and the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, along with AI ETFs such as the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ and the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF IRBO, are well-positioned to benefit as the AI boom continues.\nTo learn more, please watch the short video above.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged higher on Tuesday, jumping as much as 5.6%. As of 11:54 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 5.1%.\nThe catalyst that sent the chipmaker and artificial intelligence (AI) specialist higher was word that another AI start-up had raised billions of dollars, which is likely good news for Nvidia.\nxAI, the AI start-up founded by Elon Musk, announced on Sunday it had raised $6 billion in its latest funding round. The company said in a blog post that the influx of cash would be used \"to take xAI's first products to market, build advanced infrastructure, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies.\" In a subsequent post on X (formerly Twitter), Musk said the series B funding round valued xAI at $18 billion.\nThe company, which was founded last July, is the creator of Grok, the generative AI chatbot that competes with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Grok is available on X and is \"modeled after the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, so intended to answer almost anything and, far harder, even suggest what questions to ask!\"\nSo what does all this have to do with Nvidia? It's a signal that there's still plenty of appetite for continued investment in AI. Investors have been worried that the demand for AI could fall off, but this helps illustrate that's not the case.\nAdditionally, since xAI is working to rival ChatGPT, the underlying large language models will require plenty of computational horsepower to bring Grok up to par. Since the company isn't developing AI chips of its own, the vast majority of the processors will likely come courtesy of Nvidia -- the industry leader -- which will directly boost the company's sales.\nThis comes on the heels of Nvidia's blockbuster financial report and upcoming 10-for-1 stock split. For the fourth consecutive quarter, the company delivered triple-digit revenue and profit gains and is guiding for more. This helps illustrate the ongoing demand for AI.\nFurthermore, at roughly 38 times forward earnings, Nvidia stock is still reasonably priced when viewed through the lens of its ongoing opportunity.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nNvidia (NVDA) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 50%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 87.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -12.3%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 0.6%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "BioHive-2, an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD with NVIDIA DGX H100 systems, ranked #35 in the TOP500 list of the most powerful supercomputers in the world across all industries as of May 2024.\nSALT LAKE CITY, May 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Recursion (NASDAQ: RXRX), a leading clinical stage TechBio company decoding biology to industrialize drug discovery, today announced the completion of BioHive-2, Recursion\u2019s new NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD AI supercomputer, powered by 63 DGX H100 systems with a total of 504 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs interconnected by NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking. This NVIDIA-powered AI supercomputer results in four times faster speeds than Recursion\u2019s original supercomputer, BioHive-1, in benchmark performance tests. Based on available data, BioHive-2 is the fastest supercomputer wholly owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company worldwide.\n\"Scaled data generation paired with scaled computation is required to leverage AI in a space as vast and complex as biology,\u201d said Ben Mabey, Chief Technology Officer at Recursion. \u201cRecursion has spent the last decade generating and aggregating one of the largest biological and chemical datasets in the world, purpose-built for training new AI models. With BioHive-2 now online, we have significantly more computational horsepower to accelerate our use of our ever-growing dataset, extending our ability to train larger and more generalizable foundation models and AI agents to industrialize our drug discovery efforts.\u201d\nRecursion has demonstrated the importance of scaled computation by developing groundbreaking new foundation models like Phenom-1, a deep-learning model designed to extract biologically meaningful features from images of cells. As Recursion increased the size of the training data and the number of model parameters, the model\u2019s performance increased, demonstrating a need for ample compute to train larger models. The experimentation and training to produce Phenom-1 required several months of computational time on BioHive-1. With BioHive-2, multiple ambitious AI projects of similar or greater size could be executed in parallel in shorter timeframes, enabling both the Recursion and Valence Labs teams to push on the frontier of AI in drug discovery and unlock the latent value of Recursion\u2019s data.\nA smaller model similar to Phenom-1, called Phenom-Beta, has been released for external use on the NVIDIA BioNeMo platform. The Phenom series is just one of several different models Recursion has developed to accelerate the drug discovery process using biological, chemical, and real-world patient data. Phenom-Beta is the first third-party model to be made available on the BioNeMo platform.\n\u201cAccelerated computing, combined with the power of generative AI, is propelling the pharmaceutical industry into a new, advanced era of drug discovery,\u201d said Rory Kelleher, global head of business development for life sciences at NVIDIA. \u201cBioHive-2, powered by NVIDIA DGX AI supercomputing, is poised to accelerate the development of additional industry-leading foundation models across biology, chemistry, and healthcare.\u201d\nOther achievements that relied on Recursion\u2019s platform, powered by NVIDIA accelerated computing, include the massive protein-ligand interaction prediction dataset announced last year. Recursion predicted the protein target(s) for approximately 36 billion chemical compounds in the Enamine REAL Space. As a result of this significant computational accomplishment, Recursion and Enamine have formed a collaboration to generate enriched compound libraries for the global drug discovery industry.\nAbout RecursionRecursion is a clinical stage TechBio company leading the space by decoding biology to industrialize drug discovery. Enabling its mission is the Recursion OS, a platform built across diverse technologies that continuously expands one of the world\u2019s largest proprietary biological, chemical and patient-centric datasets.

        "Author": "  Avi Kapoor ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares closed slightly higher on Tuesday ahead of an earnings report set to be released on Wednesday. The company's stock surged around 20% over the past month, while adding 98% year-to-date.\nAnalysts expect the Santa Clara, California-based company to report quarterly earnings at $5.59 per share, up sharply from 98 cents per share in the year-ago period. NVIDIA is projected to post quarterly revenue of $24.65 billion, compared to $6.52 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nSeveral analysts raised their price targets on Nvidia prior to the release of quarterly results. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra maintained NVIDIA with an Outperform, while raising the price target from $1,050 to $1,200. Stifel analyst Ruben Roy boosted the price target from $910 to $1,085, while Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland increased the price target from $1,050 to $1,100. Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis also raised the price target on the stock from $850 to $1,100.\nWith the recent buzz around Nvidia, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Nvidia has a dividend yield of 0.02%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 4 cents a share (16 cents a year).\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Nvidia, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Nvidia's $0.16 dividend: $6,000 / $0.16 \u00a0= 37,500 shares\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $35,769,750 worth of Nvidia, or 37,500 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.16 = 7,500 shares, or $7,153,950 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\nView more earnings on NVDA\nAlso Read: Top 5 Health Care Stocks Which Could Rescue Your Portfolio This Month\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\nNVDA Price Action: Shares of Nvidia gained 0.6% to close at $953.86 on Tuesday.\nRead More: Jim Cramer Calls This Healthcare Stock A \u2018Worthy Spec,\u2019 Recommends Avoiding Canada Goose\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Nvidia Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings Report originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Author": "  Jing Pan ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a prominent trend in the tech sector. As a leading chipmaker powering numerous AI advancements, Nvidia (NVDA) has become a market favorite.\nOver the last five years, Nvidia shares have surged from $42 to $904, marking a staggering gain of more than 2,000%.\nJeff Bezos told his siblings to invest $10K in his startup called Amazon, and now their stake is worth over $1B \u2014 3 ways to get rich without having to gamble on risky public stocks\nCar insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year \u2014 but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free)\nThese 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 \u2014 and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\nAmong those who profited big time from Nvidia\u2019s massive rally is billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller.\nIn a recent interview with CNBC, Druckenmiller explained what got him on the profit train.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t early with Nvidia, my young partner was early with Nvidia. He called me in the fall of \u201922 and said that he thought all this excitement about blockchain was going to be far outweighed by AI and I asked him how to play it and he told me I should buy this company, Nvidia. I didn't even know how to spell it \u2014 I bought it,\u201d he said.\nDruckenmiller recalled that one month after he invested in Nvidia, ChatGPT emerged, prompting him to upsize his stake.\n\u201cEven an old guy like me could figure out, OK, what that meant. So, I increased the position substantially,\u201d he said.\nDruckenmiller certainly made a good decision, as Nvidia shares truly began to soar after ChatGPT came to public attention.\nBut as shares skyrocketed to astronomical levels, Druckenmiller began to take some profit.\nA 13F filing from his company Duquesne Family Office revealed that Druckenmiller sold 257,162 shares of Nvidia in Q4 of 2023, reducing his position by 29.4%.\nAnd the billionaire continued to trim his position in the chipmaker.\n\u201cWhen the stock went from $150 to $900, I'm not Warren Buffett, I don\u2019t own things for 10 or 20 years. I wish I was Warren Buffett \u2014 and $150 to $900 \u2014 yes we did cut that position and a lot of other positions in late March. I just need a break. We've had a hell of a run,\u201d he told CNBC, adding that much of what his team identified has now been recognized by the marketplace.\nRead more: This little-known investment strategy can save you thousands on your taxes\nSpeaking about the massive future potential of AI, Druckenmiller also mentioned another transformative force that has had a huge impact on society: the internet.\n\u201cIf we were all sitting here in 1999 talking about the internet, or anybody was talking about it, I don't think anybody would have estimated it would be as big as it has gotten in 20 years,\u201d he said.\nWhile the internet has indeed become monumental and enriched many investors, Druckenmiller emphasized that its journey wasn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the iPhone, we didn't have Uber, we didn't have Facebook, yada yada. And yet if you bought the NASDAQ in 99, it went down 80% before that all came to fruition,\u201d he pointed out.\nDruckenmiller believed that the NASDAQ situation is \u201cnot going to happen with AI.\u201d In fact, he emphasized that for the long term, his team is as bullish on AI as they\u2019ve ever been.\nHowever, he drew parallels between the two forces.\n\u201cAI could rhyme with the internet. As we go through all this capital spending we need to do, the payoff \u2014 while it's incrementally coming in by the day \u2014 the big payoff might be four to five years from now,\u201d he explained.\nIn other words, investors eyeing big returns from the sector will likely need to be patient.\n\u201cSo AI might be a little overhyped now, but underhyped long term,\u201d Druckenmiller remarked.\nWall Street is also optimistic about the sector's potential, evident from bullish price targets set for key AI players. For instance, HSBC analyst Frank Lee has assigned a \u2018Buy\u2019 rating to Nvidia with a price target of $1,350, implying a potential upside of 50% from the current levels.\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof \u2014 and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate \u2014 without the headache of being a landlord. Here's how\n'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs \u2014 take advantage today\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "Title": "Wall Street Analysts Think Nvidia (NVDA) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.20 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.8% and 4.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>The ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nShould You Invest in NVDA?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month to $23.94.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "So far, Nvidia\u00a0has been one of the biggest winners of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Shares jumped 173% during the past year as the company reported unprecedented demand for its graphics processing units or GPUs, chips that power all of the most advanced AI systems.\nHowever, some billionaire hedge fund managers trimmed their positions in Nvidia during the first quarter, while purchasing shares of two other AI stocks: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM).\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management sold 720,004 shares of Nvidia stock, reducing his stake by 35%. Meanwhile, he increased his positions in Amazon and Salesforce by 32% and 36%, respectively. Those stocks rank as his largest and 12th-largest holdings, respectively, excluding options.\nLouis Bacon of Moore Capital Management sold 2,006 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 19%. He also increased his stake in Amazon by 18% and opened a new position in Salesforce. Those stocks rank as his largest and sixth-largest holdings, respectively, excluding options.\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 2,937,060 shares of Nvidia stock, reducing his stake by 68%. Meanwhile, he increased his position in Amazon by 3% and doubled his stake in Salesforce. Those stocks rank as his second- and fourth-largest holdings, respectively.\nInvestors need not interpret those trades to mean Nvidia is a poor investment. All three hedge fund managers still have a stake in the chipmaker. But Amazon and Salesforce warrant further consideration. Here are the important details.\nAmazon operates the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe in terms of gross merchandise sales, and strength in retail has allowed the company to build a booming digital advertising business. Amazon is the biggest retail media company in the United States, and the third-biggest adtech company worldwide. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the market in cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue.\nAmazon is using artificial intelligence (AI) to create monetization opportunities and boost efficiency across its different businesses. In e-commerce, it recently announced a generative AI shopping assistant called Rufus that will help consumers find and compare products. Amazon also debuted a generative AI assistant for sellers that streamlines the creation of product pages. Finally, the company uses AI in its logistics business to manage inventory and optimize delivery routes.\nIn advertising, Amazon uses machine learning to ensure consumers see the most relevant advertisements. That ultimately translates into more successful campaigns for marketers, which makes Amazon an even more attractive advertising partner. The company has also launched a generative AI tool that lets brands turn product profile photos into lifestyle images.\nIn cloud computing, AWS is already well positioned to benefit from AI given its leadership in cloud infrastructure and platform services, but the company has also introduced new products. Amazon Bedrock is a cloud service that lets brands customize pretrained large language models and build generative AI applications. Amazon Q is a conversational assistant that can summarize information and automate tasks like coding.\nWall Street analysts expect Amazon to grow earnings per share at 24% annually over the next three to five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 50 times earnings look relatively reasonable. Indeed, Amazon is trading near its cheapest earnings multiple in two years. I would feel comfortable buying this AI stock today, and I think patient investors should consider doing the same.\nSalesforce is the market leader in customer relationship management (CRM) software, and its market share exceeds that of the next four competitors combined. Its platform brings together productivity applications for sales, customer service, marketing, and commerce. Salesforce will undoubtedly benefit as core CRM spending grows, but two new products extend its addressable opportunities in the adjacent areas of data management and automation.\nFirst, Data Cloud unifies customer data from across internal sources (Salesforce CRM software) and external sources (third-party data platforms), and it lets users activate that data to automate workflows, personalize the customer experience, and develop AI applications. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff says Data Cloud is the fastest-growing product in company history.\nSecond, Einstein Copilot is a natural language interface that leans on generative AI to automate tasks across the CRM platform. For instance, Einstein can summarize information and surface relevant insights for sales and customer service teams. It can also assist commerce teams in developing digital storefronts, and it can help marketing teams create advertising campaigns.\nCRM spending is forecast to grow at 13.9% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. Salesforce should benefit from that tailwind in any case, but especially because Data Cloud and Einstein Copilot add value to pre-existing products and create cross-sell opportunities for the company. Indeed, Benioff said he believes \"Data Cloud will become the heart and soul\" of the Salesforce CRM platform as businesses invest in AI, simply because AI must be rooted in good data to be effective.\nWall Street analysts expect Salesforce to grow earnings per share at 21% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 64.8 times earnings looks quite pricey. Of course, Salesforce may grow earnings more quickly than analysts expect, but I would wait for a cheaper valuation multiple before buying this stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Max Juang ",
        "Text": "Leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) beat analysts' expectations in Q1 CY2024, with revenue up 262% year on year to $26.04 billion. On top of that, next quarter's revenue guidance ($28 billion at the midpoint) was surprisingly good and 4.3% above what analysts were expecting. It made a non-GAAP profit of $6.12 per share, improving from its profit of $1.09 per share in the same quarter last year.\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Find out in our full research report.\nRevenue: $26.04 billion vs analyst estimates of $24.59 billion (5.9% beat)\nEPS (non-GAAP): $6.12 vs analyst estimates of $5.58 (9.7% beat)\nRevenue Guidance for Q2 CY2024 is $28 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $26.84 billion\nGross Margin (GAAP): 78.4%, up from 64.6% in the same quarter last year\nInventory Days Outstanding: 95, up from 90 in the previous quarter\nFree Cash Flow of $14.94 billion, up 32.8% from the previous quarter\nMarket Capitalization: $2.35 trillion\n\u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun \u2014 companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center \u2014 AI factories \u2014 to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.\nFounded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets.\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\nNvidia's revenue growth over the last three years has been incredible, averaging 83.7% annually. As you can see below, this quarter was especially strong, with revenue growing from $7.19 billion in the same quarter last year to $26.04 billion. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy).\nNvidia had a fantastic quarter as its 262% year-on-year revenue growth beat analysts' estimates by 5.9%. This marks 4 straight quarters of growth, implying that Nvidia is in the middle of its cycle, as a typical upcycle generally lasts 8-10 quarters.\nNvidia's management team believes its revenue growth will continue, guiding to 107% year-on-year growth next quarter. Analysts expect the company to grow its revenue by 56.6% over the next 12 months.\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\nDays Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business' capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production.\nThis quarter, Nvidia's DIO came in at 95, which is 9 days below its five-year average. These numbers show that despite the recent increase, there's no indication of an excessive inventory buildup.\nWe were impressed by Nvidia's healthy gross margin improvement this quarter, indicating elevated pricing power. We were also excited its revenue and EPS outperformed Wall Street's estimates, driven by better-than-expected results in its data center and automotive segments; the result in its automotive segment (17% year-on-year revenue growth) was especially impressive given the industry is in a cyclical downturn and many other semiconductor companies have posted year-on-year declines for that end market. Lastly, we note its inventory levels increased, likely due to the company stocking up on products in anticipation of strong demand.\nDuring the announcement of the results, Nvidia issued a 10-1 stock split that will commence on Friday, June 7, 2024. Looking ahead, Nvidia's revenue for the next quarter beat expectations again.\nOverall, we think this was a great quarter that shareholders will appreciate. The stock is up 4.6% after reporting and currently trades at $992.56 per share.\nNvidia may have had a good quarter, but does that mean you should invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n"

        "Title": "Where Will Nvidia's Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market this year. Even if it has experienced some highs and lows during that period, it's still up an impressive 80% for far in 2024.\nBut that's past performance, and investors want to know where Nvidia is headed to from here. However, predicting where a stock is going in two or three months can be tricky and can be affected by external events like the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy.\nSo instead, let's focus on where Nvidia may be in five years, taking a long-term view that focuses on how the business executes rather than short-term market sentiment.\nNvidia's incredible rise can be easily tied to one trend -- the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Creating AI models requires an incredible amount of computing power. But that's where Nvidia's GPUs come in. GPUs, or graphics processing units, allow many computations to occur in parallel, which is useful for AI model training. Furthermore, when companies buy GPUs, they don't just buy one or two; they buy them by the hundreds or thousands and connect them to a server to create an incredibly powerful computer.\nThese GPUs aren't cheap, either. Nvidia's current flagship GPU, the H100, costs around $30,000 apiece. So, with companies buying truckloads of GPUs at a time, Nvidia is seeing a massive benefit.\nBut the question many investors have is, \"When will this end?\" While I don't have the answer, I can tell you that GPUs don't last forever. GPU companies like Nvidia are always innovating, and in a few years, the GPUs that are cutting edge now will be slower and less efficient than the newer ones available. This will drive another upgrade cycle, and with Nvidia's GPUs being the most commonly used right now, there will be switching costs if customers decide to go with competitors' products.\nIn 2022, UptimeInstitute found that 33% of organizations surveyed refreshed their servers every five years. That's up from 31% in 2020 and 20% in 2015. This time lengthening shows that upgrading isn't as beneficial as it was in the past, which could elongate the refresh cycle.\nStill, with all of the innovation being driven by AI demand, this refresh cycle may be shortened due to the immense development of GPUs dedicated to AI models.\nBut does all of this create an investible stock? It's no secret that Nvidia's stock has gotten expensive, and I'm not talking about a dollar figure (although it's nearing the $1,000 mark, which could indicate a stock split is coming). Instead, I'll use an earnings metric to value the company to know how expensive the stock is.\nBecause Nvidia is a rapidly changing business, using trailing earnings in the more traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio isn't useful. Instead, I'll use forward earnings projections (which utilize analyst projections over the next 12 months) to value the company. While this method has its pitfalls, it is the best method investors have for analyzing Nvidia's stock.\nAt 35 times forward earnings, Nvidia is not cheap. Compared to the S&P 500 index -- which trades at 21 times forward earnings, giving a good average of the entire stock market -- Nvidia has a hefty premium attached to its stock.\nBut very few stocks in the S&P 500 are projected to grow revenue at an 80% pace in their current fiscal year. Beyond that, the GPU market is also slated to grow, with Precedence Research estimating the GPU market could be worth nearly $800 billion by 2032.\nWith Nvidia's stronghold on the market and its $61 billion revenue mark last fiscal year, there's still plenty of room for growth. As a result, I think Nvidia is a stock that can continue moving higher over the next five years. While it's expensive now, investors can still get in on the stock and make money if they anticipate holding on for the next five years, even if Nvidia dips due to a spending drawdown.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) once again hit the ball out of the park in its most recent quarter, as revenue and net income soared in the triple digits. That, and the announcement of an upcoming stock split, helped the shares to surge above $1,000.\nThe company reported $26 billion in revenue in the fiscal 2025 first quarter, thanks to demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips and related products and services. That's huge. But how much of this enormous amount is actual profit?\nFirst, this isn't a one-time event for the chip designer. Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, and this has helped the company report billions of dollars in earnings over the past few years. Ever since the start of the AI boom, Nvidia's earnings and stock price have been roaring higher, led by sales to customers in the AI space.\nLet's take a look at the chart, below. It shows Nvidia's $26 billion in revenue, as well as the expenses and income taxes that chip away at that figure. As a result, as also shown in the chart, Nvidia's net income is about $14.9 billion. So more than $11 billion is flowing out of Nvidia's coffers in order to support its growth (and take care of standard obligations, like taxes).\nWhat does this mean for the company and its investors? Nvidia must continue to spend on research and development and other areas to ensure its market dominance -- but it must keep the spending at levels that don't threaten profitability. So far, the company has done a great job in that area as we can see in the chart, and this should please investors.\nThis suggests that, if demand continues at high levels, Nvidia's earnings could continue to climb. Nvidia makes a great stock to buy right now and hold for the long term as the AI growth story enters its next chapters.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Before the June 7 Stock Split?",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, and this has helped earnings to climb in the triple digits in recent years. AI may be the hottest investment theme right now, and this could continue. After all, analysts say the AI market could be worth more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. So it's no surprise that Nvidia shares have skyrocketed, advancing 600% over the past three years.\nThis momentum helped push Nvidia shares to nearly $1,000 in recent times. And they actually surpassed that level after the company announced another blowout quarter, along with a move many investors had been hoping for: a stock split.\nThis will significantly lower the price of each Nvidia share. The big question is: Should you buy Nvidia stock before the June 7 stock split or wait until you can get shares at the lower price?\nFirst, let's talk about stock splits, in general. They don't change the market value of a company or the value of your holding if you already own the shares. Instead, a stock split will lower the price of each share by offering more shares to current holders. The ratio of the split determines the number of shares each investor will receive.\nIn the case of Nvidia, it's a 10-for-1 stock split, so for every one share you hold, you'll get an extra nine. At today's price of about $1,139, each individual share will now sell for $113. You'll have to be a shareholder of record as of June 6 to benefit, and the extra shares will be distributed after the market close on June 7.\nShould you get in on Nvidia before or after this much-awaited stock split? The short answer is it doesn't matter, and here's why. As mentioned earlier, a stock split doesn't change the value of the company or the value of an investor's holding. If you buy one share today or 10 shares after the split, you'll be investing the same amount of cash.\nAlso, stock splits themselves aren't catalysts for share performance since they're just mechanical movements -- so Nvidia shares aren't likely to soar the day after the split just because a split occurred. Any potential gains, which could come either now or post-split, probably would be linked to the company's recent earnings performance or future growth prospects.\nThe split is positive for Nvidia because it offers a broader range of investors access to the stock, and the company even stated that as its reason for launching the operation. Yes, fractional shares exist, but certain brokerages don't offer them, and some investors prefer buying full shares. That doesn't mean a huge wave of new investors will buy Nvidia shares post-split, but over time, a lower per-share price could attract more investment.\nNow let's get back to you. If you want to bet on a current and future leader in the AI space, Nvidia makes an excellent buy (now or post-split). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering the key AI tasks of training and inferencing -- and more. And demand for Nvidia's chips and systems is so high, the company says it's \"racing\" to keep up.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia is set to release its Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever later this year. And the company pledges to update its top-performing chips annually. This will make it very difficult for rivals to unseat this market giant.\nThough we all tend to look at a stock price and immediately think \"that's cheap\" or \"that's expensive,\" it's important to instead look at valuation, or what the stock really is worth. Today, Nvidia trades at 42x forward earnings estimates, which looks reasonable, considering the company's market position and growth prospects.\nNvidia makes a great buy and could offer you explosive growth over time -- whether you buy the stock before or after the upcoming stock split.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sweta Killa ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA NVDA has been on a solid run with no signs of a slowdown, driven by the flurry of continued artificial intelligence (AI) investments and blockbuster earnings. Its shares closed above the $1,100 milestone for the first time ever.Last trading at $1,139, the AI chipmaker, the world\u2019s third-most valuable company, is now just $100 billion away in market value to overtake Apple AAPL in a major reshuffle of Wall Street's biggest players. NVIDIA's market capitalization reached $2.8 trillion, compared to a market value of $2.9 trillion for Apple, the second-most valuable company after Microsoft MSFT.Investors seeking to tap the robust growth could consider ETFs having the largest allocation to this AI darling stock. These are Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, Grizzle Growth ETF DARP, TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF LRNZ and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ.\nNVIDIA has been at the forefront of technology companies racing to build AI into their products and services. NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said, \u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun \u2014 companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center \u2014 AI factories \u2014 to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence.\u201dThe latest catalyst driving NVIDIA is the billions of dollars funding into Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence start-up. Elon Musk announced that AI start-up xAI's supercomputer will run on NVIDIA technology (read: Why You Should Buy AI & Chip ETFs Post-NVIDIA Earnings).NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell GPU chip is expected to drive another round of massive growth for the chip maker, along with its CUDA software platform and its exposure to the automotive market. Investors cheered CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s comments regarding their latest chip, Blackwell, which is expected to be launched in the second half of the year.\nLast week, NVIDIA reported blowout first-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein it topped both earnings and revenue estimates and offered a bullish revenue outlook for the current quarter, thanks to the solid demand for its artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled GPU chips. Its data center revenues skyrocketed 427% year over year to a record $22.6 billion, buoyed by the rapid adoption of AI technologies (read: AI Boom Bolsters NVIDIA's Q1 Growth: ETFs to Tap).\nThe chipmaker announced a 10-to-1 stock split, effective Jun 7, and boosted its quarterly dividend by 150% to 10 cents per share. The stock split has sparked a retail frenzy as it will make NVIDIA shares more accessible to a wider range of investors, including the ones who make small trades, and increase liquidity. Also, it will likely pave the way for the company\u2019s inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Additionally, the lower price could pave the way for the company\u2019s inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Amazon AMZN joined the Dow earlier this year after undergoing a 20-for-1 stock split in June 2022.\nDriven by explosive growth prospects, Wall Street analysts have turned more bullish on NVIDIA and raised the target price on the stock. At least 28 of the 58 brokerage firms have raised their price targets on the stock, pushing up the median view to $1,200, according to LSEG data.NVIDIA currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms.

        "Text": "NVIDIA NVDA has been on a solid run with no signs of a slowdown, driven by the flurry of continued artificial intelligence (AI) investments and blockbuster earnings. Its shares closed above the $1,100 milestone for the first time ever.Last trading at $1,139, the AI chipmaker, the world\u2019s third-most valuable company, is now just $100 billion away in market value to overtake Apple AAPL in a major reshuffle of Wall Street's biggest players. NVIDIA's market capitalization reached $2.8 trillion, compared to a market value of $2.9 trillion for Apple, the second-most valuable company after Microsoft MSFT.Investors seeking to tap the robust growth could consider ETFs having the largest allocation to this AI darling stock. These are Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, Grizzle Growth ETF DARP, TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF LRNZ and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ.\nNVIDIA has been at the forefront of technology companies racing to build AI into their products and services. NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said, \u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun \u2014 companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center \u2014 AI factories \u2014 to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence.\u201dThe latest catalyst driving NVIDIA is the billions of dollars funding into Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence start-up. Elon Musk announced that AI start-up xAI's supercomputer will run on NVIDIA technology (read: Why You Should Buy AI & Chip ETFs Post-NVIDIA Earnings).NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell GPU chip is expected to drive another round of massive growth for the chip maker, along with its CUDA software platform and its exposure to the automotive market. Investors cheered CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s comments regarding their latest chip, Blackwell, which is expected to be launched in the second half of the year.\nLast week, NVIDIA reported blowout first-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein it topped both earnings and revenue estimates and offered a bullish revenue outlook for the current quarter, thanks to the solid demand for its artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled GPU chips. Its data center revenues skyrocketed 427% year over year to a record $22.6 billion, buoyed by the rapid adoption of AI technologies (read: AI Boom Bolsters NVIDIA's Q1 Growth: ETFs to Tap).\nThe chipmaker announced a 10-to-1 stock split, effective Jun 7, and boosted its quarterly dividend by 150% to 10 cents per share. The stock split has sparked a retail frenzy as it will make NVIDIA shares more accessible to a wider range of investors, including the ones who make small trades, and increase liquidity. Also, it will likely pave the way for the company\u2019s inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Additionally, the lower price could pave the way for the company\u2019s inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Amazon AMZN joined the Dow earlier this year after undergoing a 20-for-1 stock split in June 2022.\nDriven by explosive growth prospects, Wall Street analysts have turned more bullish on NVIDIA and raised the target price on the stock. At least 28 of the 58 brokerage firms have raised their price targets on the stock, pushing up the median view to $1,200, according to LSEG data.NVIDIA currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms.

        "Title": "3 AI Stocks That Have More Upside Than Nvidia, According to Wall Street",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia has undoubtedly been the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stock to own over the past year and a half. Since the start of 2023, shares of the chipmaker have soared an incredible 500%. Many stocks don't generate those types of returns over a decade or even longer, and Nvidia has managed to do that in just 16 months. Given those types of gains, it's not unreasonable to expect that many Wall Street analysts believe it may be approaching a peak. The consensus analyst price target suggests that Nvidia's stock may only rise another 13% from where it is today.\nAI investors may want to consider other options, which may have more room to rise higher. Three stocks that analysts are much more bullish about include SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and UiPath (NYSE: PATH). Here's a look at how much upside these stocks may have and whether they are worth adding to your portfolio today.\nThe analyst consensus price target for SoundHound AI is a little less than $7, which would mean that SoundHound's stock could rise by around 50% if you believe it could hit that value within the next year or so.\nSoundHound gained notoriety this year after investors learned that Nvidia invested in the voice AI company. Its AI voice platform can help incorporate AI into vehicles, drive-thrus, and other ways to help create a conversational experience between the user and AI. There's a lot of potential in many industries for this type of technology to facilitate the AI experience for customers.\nThe biggest problem, however, is that there's been a lot of hype around SoundHound, but its results are still fairly modest; the company has a lot to prove, given how much competition there may be out there. Fast-food restaurant chain Wendy's, for example, has already begun to deploy an AI-powered drive-thru ordering experience through the company's own FreshAI platform, which uses generative AI.\nFor SoundHound to be a great buy, it needs to prove that its technology is the real deal and that it can be better than the competition. In the last three months of 2023, it generated an impressive 80% revenue growth, with its top line totaling $17.1 million. However, the business posted a net loss of $18 million, and it has been burning through cash, and it will likely need a lot of that cash to invest in its operations.\nSoundHound AI could rally by 50%, but if it does, it'll likely be due to speculative reasons; the company's fundamentals aren't strong enough just yet to make this a slam-dunk buy. For most investors, it's probably a bit too early to invest in SoundHound AI.\nA stock that has even more upside, according to analysts, is Chinese tech company Baidu; Wall Street believes it can rise by about 60% to nearly $172. The company is often compared to Alphabet's Google, as it has a popular search engine platform and a cloud business. It is always looking to invest in new technologies, with AI being no exception.\nThe reason investors haven't been overly bullish on the stock (it's down 11% this year) is because there are concerns it may have close ties to the Chinese government, which could impact not just its growth opportunities but it may also lead to problems for the stock down the road. In the past, investors have been concerned that Chinese stocks may be delisted from U.S. exchanges, and the U.S. government looking to ban TikTok due to the Chinese government's influence may only exacerbate those worries.\nIn addition to that, Baidu's growth rate has been a bit soft. In 2023, the company's revenue grew by 9% to just under $19 billion. Ideally, AI investors will want to see a faster growth rate than that to be convinced that a company is truly taking advantage of significant growth opportunities in AI. There is, however, hope that with its chatbot, Ernie, hitting 200 million users, Baidu may have a potential growth catalyst there, which could help accelerate the company's growth rate.\nGiven Baidu's low valuation -- it trades at 10 times its expected future earnings -- I could see a path for the stock to hit analyst price targets as it is a great way to invest in the Chinese tech market, and Chinese stocks in general have been undervalued for a while. The stock, does, however, come with some elevated risk and may not be suitable for all types of investors.\nUiPath has an automation platform that helps companies create processes that can save them both time and money. It can remember the steps users take and automate them. Unfortunately, despite the potential value it can add for businesses, UiPath's stock has made for an underwhelming investment so far this year, falling by 20% year to date.\nThe company has been generating some encouraging results, posting sales of $405.3 million for the quarter ending Jan. 31, which grew at a rate of 31% year over year. Another positive for the business is that it also posted a profit last quarter totaling $33.9 million, which was a big improvement from the prior-year period when UiPath incurred a net loss of $27.7 million.\nAnalysts believe shares of UiPath could hit $27, rising by 40% from where it is now. That doesn't seem like an unrealistic proposition, given its high growth rate, the opportunities for automation, and the business also posting a profit. With a price-to-earnings-growth ratio of less than 1, the stock could be a bargain buy for long-term investors.\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Investors\u2019 favorite NVIDIA NVDA is set to release its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 22, after market close. The world\u2019s most valuable semiconductor company continued its hot streak of 2023, gaining more than $1.1 trillion in market cap so far this year, powered by the accelerating demand for artificial intelligence (AI).The chipmaker has risen 37.1% over the past three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 21.5%. The strong trend is expected to reverse, given that NVIDIA has a higher chance to beat earnings estimates and saw positive earnings estimate revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat (read: What's Ahead for Nvidia ETFs?).ETFs having the largest allocation to NVIDIA could make compelling plays ahead of its earnings report. These include Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, Grizzle Growth ETF DARP, TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF LRNZ and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ.\nNVIDIA currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.62% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The world\u2019s largest chipmaker saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past seven days for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. NVIDIA is expected to post massive earnings and revenue growth of 402.7% and 237.5%, respectively, for the to-be-reported quarter. NVIDIA\u2019s earnings surprise history is good, as it delivered an earnings surprise of 20.18%, on average, in the last four quarters.NVIDIA currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.20 a month ago based on 41 recommendations.Of the 41 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 87.8% and 4.88% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 87.8%, while Buy represented 4.88%.Based on short-term price targets offered by 40 analysts, the average price target for NVIDIA comes to $990.51. The forecasts range from a low of $608.40 to a high of $1,350.00.\nInvestors will be closely watching the updates for the company\u2019s new chip, Blackwell, which will be the world\u2019s most powerful chip and the highest-performance AI chip on the market ahead of its current H200 series and AMD\u2019s (AMD) MI300 series. Blackwell-based products will be available later this year. Most analysts expect a slowdown during the transition to these next-generation models from NVIDIA\u2019s older H100 chips.NVIDIA remained an undisputed leader in the AI space even following the recent launch of GPT-4o from ChatGPT maker OpenAI. It continues to benefit from the explosive demand for its cutting-edge chips used in AI applications and rapidly growing data centers. NVIDIA's chips are used in applications ranging from robotics and the metaverse to medical imaging and video analytics (read: 4 ETFs to Tap the Renewed AI Craze on Wall Street).For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the graphics chipmaker expects revenues of around $24 billion, indicating growth of 234% year over year.\nLet\u2019s delve into each ETF below:Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF (SHOC)Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF seeks broad market exposure to the U.S. semiconductor sector.

That's why you should start by looking at stocks that are set to beat the market over the next 12 months, a strategy that's been proven to generate strong returns.\nNow, let's break down why adding this one exceptional stock, highlighted below, to your portfolio could be a recipe for success.\nWhy You Should Pay Attention to Nvidia (NVDA)\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.\nNVDA was added to the Zacks Focus List on May 20, 2019 at $39.13 per share. Since then, shares have increased 2196.91% to $898.78.\nSix analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.72 to $23.94. NVDA boasts an average earnings surprise of 20.2%.\nEarnings for Nvidia are forecasted to see growth of 84.7% for the current fiscal year as well.\nIt can be very profitable to buy stocks with rising earnings estimates, as stock prices respond to revisions.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to raise the bar on itself and the rest of the AI scene. When the GPU king went into its latest quarterly earnings, a lot of expectation was built in. Additionally, many investors were eager to look for any traces of hair on the quarter.\nAs it turned out, there wasn\u2019t much negative to get behind, even as the market pulled back a bit on the day NVDA stock blasted to new highs above the $1,000 per share mark. Indeed, it seemed inevitable that Nvidia would surpass the milestone.\nUp next, it may be staring down the title of the world\u2019s second-largest company if it\u2019s able to surpass Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in market cap. Whether Nvidia hits a $3 trillion market cap amid this post-earnings run remains to be seen. It\u2019s very realistic that the feat can be achieved on the back of its latest blowout.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nIf the stock\u2019s melt-up has you looking elsewhere, though, look to three AI stocks that could outperform Nvidia in the second half.\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\nIf Nvidia is booming, its second-place peer, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), looks pretty enticing.\nAfter correction this spring, I actually view AMD stock as a great company. It could add to the recent quarterly AI boom as it looks to stack up against its top rival, Nvidia.\nOn Friday, AMD stock surged by 3.7% as the broad basket of AI stocks rose at the hands of Nvidia\u2019s magnificent result. Though AMD may fall short in certain benchmarks, AMD\u2019s GPUs are powerful enough to get the job done for many enterprises. As the company pushes ahead, while looking to top its MI300 AI accelerator, AMD certainly stands out.\nLooking ahead, the MI400 series of AI accelerators, which could land in 2025, may be able to even the playing field a bit. The MI400 will get many of the same features as Nvidia\u2019s best innovations. AMD\u2019s new interconnect fabric called XSwitch will go up against NVLink as the battle for efficiency gains advances.\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\nRed-hot data center Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is fresh off a painful springtime plunge. Today, SMCI stock is coming back after shedding nearly 40% at its worst point. Still down around 25% from all-time highs, perhaps the high-flyer is ready to flap its wings again. As we enter the next stage of the AI boom, it could entail greater gains for the firms at the front of the lines.\nFirst, we have the GPU makers themselves, like Nvidia. Next, we have the data center firms that can put these GPUs to work in the most efficient way possible. However, investors should be aware of the risks, as shares are still up more than 1,700% in the past two years. It\u2019s like Super Micro Computer came from out of nowhere!\nAs Nvidia earnings jolt SMCI stock, I do view SMCI as a very intriguing, albeit risky, bet for those who believe the AI boom is just getting started. Like Nvidia, SMCI stock has been a multi-bagger. But, the stock still doesn\u2019t appear wildly expensive. At writing, Super Micro shares go for a surprisingly low 23.47 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E).\nThat\u2019s less than some consumer packaged goods companies, which I think makes little sense given Super Micro\u2019s explosive growth prospects.\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\nMagnificent Seven firm Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands to gain handsomely from the recent AI surge. Though Nvidia has been the most magnificent of the Magnificent Seven, AMZN may have the chops to outdo NVDA stock in the second half. Undoubtedly, Nvidia keeps posting blowout after blowout. Eventually, Wall Street will overshoot on the expectations front, setting the stage for less-than-incredible gains.\nFor Amazon, I still view expectations as quite muted. The company is betting big on generative AI with Amazon Web Services (AWS). More intriguing, though, is what the $1.89 trillion company could have in store from a consumer software perspective as it brings more advanced AI to Alexa.\nIndeed, many homes already have an Alexa-enabled device. As the firm rolls out a paid version of Alexa with generative AI smarts later this year, I think the e-commerce behemoth could be in for an AI upside that could catch Wall Street off-guard. Only time will tell how good AI-powered Alexa will be.\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Amazon and Apple.

        "Text": "Climbing 467% over the past three years, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has skyrocketed as investors have raced to gain artificial intelligence (AI) exposure. Those looking to add AI exposure to their portfolios may feel they've missed the boat on Nvidia stock. Plus, they may feel overwhelmed by the variety of other choices to consider.\nBut the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT) has all those bases covered. In addition to holding a large position in Nvidia, the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF provides exposure to a variety of other AI-focused companies that stand to benefit from growth in generative AI, machine learning, and large language models.\nIt wasn't so long ago that people had little exposure to generative AI. Nowadays, it feels unavoidable. And it's nearly a certainty that its presence in our lives is going to continue ramping higher. In fact, many pundits predict that it's going to accelerate considerably. Business intelligence firm Markets and Markets projects the generative AI market will represent about $21 billion in 2024 and soar at a 37% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030 when it will reach $137 billion.\nEager to benefit from the growth in generative AI, investors have unsurprisingly raced to Nvidia stock. A leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia helps data centers handle the tremendous computing demands that generative AI platforms place on them. With its recent rise, however, Nvidia stock is now trading at 69 times operating cash flow (OCF), making it unappealing for those looking to avoid high valuations.\nBranding the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF as the \"world's first Generative AI ETF,\" Roundhill Investments, the manager of the fund, cites research from Goldman Sachs that estimates AI can contribute to $7 trillion in economic growth worldwide over the next 10 years.\nWith 46 holdings in the fund, the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF offers investors wide exposure to leading companies that will drive the advancement of generative AI. Of course, Nvidia holds a prominent position in the ETF with a 10.1% weighting, making it the largest position, so those wary of Nvidia stock on its own will still have some exposure. Rounding out the top-three positions, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are the second- and third-largest positions, respectively.\nWhereas Nvidia makes the GPUs that help support generative AI computing, Microsoft is developing AI solutions such as Copilot, an AI assistant that integrates with several Microsoft products. The company's reach in AI extends further with its multibillion-dollar investment in ChatGPT. Similarly, Google is incorporating AI into offerings such as Gemini, a generative AI chatbot. And in exploring the potential for AI in various applications, Google operates the DeepMind Lab where its exploring the development of artificial general intelligence.\nWhile Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), whose Llama 3 large language model can be used to develop generative AI applications, is the fifth-largest position in the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF, it's not only Magnificent Seven stocks that hold top spots; Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) is the fourth-largest position. A generative AI application, Adobe's Firefly can be used across various Adobe products, such as Express, Photoshop, and Illustrator.\nThere's no denying that Nvidia stock is extremely alluring right now considering the company's position as a stalwart GPU developer, but it's hardly the only generative AI game in town. Investors cognizant of this fact -- and who are looking for comprehensive exposure to the industry -- therefore will want to pay particular attention to the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF, which provides a singular opportunity to gain broad exposure to generative AI. I know I am. This exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been on my watchlist for several months now, and I plan on starting a position in the coming weeks to sit in the niche of my portfolio carved out for growth investments.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Wall Street bets on stellar quarterly results from Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Arsheeya  Bajwa ",
        "Text": "By Arsheeya Bajwa\n(Reuters) -Wall Street is betting on a blowout quarterly report from Nvidia on Wednesday, with its stock near record highs as investors look for evidence that the AI chipmaker can maintain its explosive growth and stay ahead of rivals.\nThe results will be the latest test for Wall Street's picks-and-shovels trade that has turned Nvidia into the biggest winner of the generative AI boom, thanks to its chips that are essential in powering technology such as Google's Gemini to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\"There is a lot riding on Nvidia's earnings. It is the most important stock in the sector,\" said Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares, which runs an ETF that invests in the chip firm.\nA more than six-fold surge in its shares since the start of 2023 has made Nvidia Wall Street's third-most valuable firm, worth more than $2.30 trillion.\nIts 89% stock surge so far in 2024 has helped lift the broader market, and Nvidia now accounts for 5% of the S&P 500, according to LSEG data.\nAnalyst expectations for Nvidia's future earnings have climbed even faster than its shares. That last left the stock trading at about 35 times expected earnings, down from a peak of over 80 last June, according to LSEG data.\nNvidia's staggering valuation might yet have room to grow. \"It is undervalued relative to where forecasts are going,\" Rhind said.\nAnalysts on average see Nvidia reporting a 242% jump in revenue to $24.60 billion for the fiscal quarter ending in April, according to LSEG data as of May 17. Its sales in the second quarter are expected to rise almost 97%, the data showed.\nAnalysts see it reporting net income of $12.83 billion in the first quarter, up from $2.04 billion a year ago.\nFor several quarters, demand for Nvidia's AI processors has outpaced the number of chips that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, its contract manufacturer, has been able to make.\n\"The only thing really holding Nvidia back right now is supply,\" said Inge Heydorn, a partner at investment firm G.P. Bullhound, which owns Nvidia shares.\nInvestors are also concerned about restrictions by Washington on exports of Nvidia's top-shelf AI chips to China.\nInvestors are awaiting updates on chips Nvidia is developing for the Chinese market after export curbs reduced its revenue share from China to about 9% of sales in the fourth quarter, from about 22% share in the third.\nAfter several quarters of three-fold growth in its revenue last year, Nvidia is also grappling with tough comparisons.\n\"As the numbers get bigger, you're up against the law of big numbers, and that percentage beat starts to become less and less,\" BNP Paribas Exane analyst David O'Connor said.\nRising prices of high-bandwidth memory chips used in its AI semiconductors could also dent margins at Nvidia, with analysts expecting adjusted gross margin of 75.8% in the second quarter, compared with expectations of about 77% in the first.\nGross margins might take a slight hit from \"memory costs going up and increasing,\" said G.P. Bullhound's Heydorn.\nOverall, analysts remain confident about Nvidia's growth as technology heavyweights from Microsoft to Meta Platforms boost spending on data centers by billions of dollars in the race for generative AI.\nGlobal spending on cloud infrastructure services is likelyto increase by 20% in 2024 compared with 18% in 2023, according to research firm Canalys.\n\"Capital expenditures from Big Tech remains high. Despite their efforts to explore alternative or in-house chips, their options are restricted by both limited supply capacity and the challenge of surpassing Nvidia's proven performance,\" said Ido Caspi, an analyst at Global X ETFs.\n\"We still view Nvidia as the industry leader for the foreseeable future.\"\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia (NVDA) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nNvidia (NVDA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 50%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 84.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -12.3%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 0.6%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.4% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia. Billionaires Steven Cohen and Israel Englander Are Buying This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead.",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has soared in the triple digits over the past year, thanks to its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. The company is the world's leading AI chipmaker, powering the crucial task of training AI models so they can then go on to solve complex problems. This has helped Nvidia's earnings soar and the stock find its spot in the portfolios of many billionaire investors.\nBut two billionaires recently cut their positions in Nvidia and, at the same time, placed bets on another AI stock instead. Steven Cohen, chief executive officer of Point72 Asset Management, decreased his holding of Nvidia shares by 66% in the fourth quarter of last year, while Israel Englander, CEO of Millennium Management, lowered his position by 45%.\nYou'll find top tech stocks among the biggest positions in these billionaires' funds, so it's clear they're focused on selecting tomorrow's AI winners. For example, two of the most heavily weighted tech stocks in Englander's fund are Microsoft and Alphabet, companies that are pouring investment into AI.\nWhat company is Cohen and Englander betting on as a potential AI winner over the long term? It's a player that recently said demand for its AI infrastructure is so strong, it's actually exceeded supply. Let's find out more about this potential AI star that's a favorite of these billionaires right now.\nYou'll probably recognize the name of this company, as it's been around for years as a software and database powerhouse. I'm talking about Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). In the fourth quarter, Cohen opened a new position in Oracle, while Englander increased his holdings in the tech giant by 138%.\nOracle, founded in the late 1970s, was originally known for its database management system but has since greatly broadened its offerings. It remains smaller than rivals like Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud computing market, but in recent times thanks to AI demand, it's recognized the cloud infrastructure growth opportunity -- and has made that its major focus.\nIn the most recent quarter, Oracle's cloud infrastructure revenue soared 49% to $1.8 billion. And total cloud revenue -- including software as a service and infrastructure as a service -- represented 38% of overall revenue. The quarter signals a turning point, with the company's total cloud revenue coming in higher than total license support revenue for the first time ever.\nOracle's cloud infrastructure business is driving growth, and by offering advantages that are winning users over, this could continue. The company notes it's cheaper than competitors, such as Google Cloud, for example. Oracle also sells a variety of cloud options such as a platform that allows users to run their own Oracle Cloud. The company even offers multicloud services, so you can use an Oracle service in another public cloud, like Microsoft's Azure.\nAs I mentioned earlier, demand for Oracle's AI infrastructure services is surpassing supply -- even as the company is expanding current data centers and opening new ones. Oracle predicts that its Gen2 cloud infrastructure business will continue in a \"hypergrowth phase\" for quite some time. The company today has 47 public cloud regions worldwide and is building eight more. Twelve of these regions connect with Azure, and more are on the way.\nOracle is likely to benefit as the capacity increase allows it to address more and more of the growing demand and it integrates its earlier acquisition of digital information systems company, Cerner.\nShould you forget Nvidia and turn to Oracle? Billionaires Steven Cohen and Israel Englander still hold a great deal of Nvidia shares, and the company offers solid long-term prospects. Nvidia sells today's top-performing chip, and its research and development resources suggest it could stay ahead as it releases new products -- such as the Blackwell architecture expected later this year. This means Nvidia shares could have plenty of room to run.\nBut Oracle, which has gained about 20% over the past year, has some catching up to do when it comes to share performance -- and it may do just that, considering recent earnings trends and long-term prospects. That makes this top tech stock look pretty cheap at just 20x forward earnings estimates -- and offers you the perfect opportunity to turn your attention away from Nvidia for a moment and follow billionaire investors into Oracle.\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "'The real AI darling': This data-center stock has beaten Nvidia by 310% since last year's blockbuster earnings",
        "Author": "  Filip De Mott ",
        "Text": "AI investment is about more than just GPUs. Power companies have also dominated, Bank of America says.\nThe firm notes that Vertiv, which makes power and cooling equipment for data centers, has beaten Nvidia by 315% over the past year.\nThe performance represents a broadening-out of the AI trade to include utility, industrial, and commodity companies.\nNvidia remains a kingpin trade amid the artificial intelligence frenzy, but investors too narrowly focused on GPU chips have missed out on an even more lucrative opportunity.\nIn a new note, Bank of America notes that stock gains for Vertiv \u2014 which makes power and cooling equipment for data center \u2014 have outpaced Nvidia returns by a whopping 315 percentage points over the past year. They're starting the comparison on May 24, 2023, right after Nvidia's first blowout quarter, which set off the entire AI boom in stocks.\nTo be exact, Vertiv has climbed 516% since the date, handily outpacing Nvidia's 211% gain. The benchmark S&P 500 has risen a comparatively paltry 29% over the same period.\n\"Vertiv is the real AI darling,\" BofA wrote in a client note.\nBofA says Vertiv's stellar performance is representative of the AI rally broadening out to include an increasing range of sectors. Much of that stems from the advanced chips that power AI on \u2014 such as the ones Nvidia produces \u2014\u00a0 requiring significantly more electricity to operate. That offers upside to industrials, utilities, and commodities, according to the firm.\n\"GPUs need 2-2.5x more power than CPUs, and expected power usage for US data centers under construction is equivalent to more than 50% of the power currently used by US data centers,\" Bank of America wrote on Monday. \"Power used by AI applications is expected to grow at a 25-33% CAGR over the next few years.\"\nOthers, such as \"Big Short\" investor Steve Eisman, have pointed out that the boost to power usage also makes these GPUs considerably hotter, putting pressure on firms such as Vertiv to improve cooling systems in data centers.\nEisman has long been a bull on US infrastructure. Aside from AI, he's betting that green policy will boost these sectors as well.\nAs Nvidia gears up for its earnings season on Wednesday, expectations remain strong, Bank of America said. The company has also set its own bar high, judging from its last twelve months: it's added $1.5 trillion in market cap and trailing earnings per share have rocketed 617%.\n\"But it's not just about NVDA anymore,\" the note said, adding: \"Fundamentals are broadening out and so should the market: NVDA drove 37% of S&P earnings growth over the LTM (and 11% of return), but is expected to drive just 9% over the next 12 months.\"\nPreviously, Goldman Sachs had similarly outlined broadening AI investment, characterizing Nvidia as the first of four phases. Eventually, utility investments will take over, at which point firms that can best integrate AI software start winning out.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

The company also said it would raise its paltry dividend by 150% to $0.10 a share, a move that seemed designed to accommodate the split, as the dividend will be $0.01, yielding approximately 0.1%.\nOn the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang said that demand for its products continues to outstrip supply, and said the company was focused on building \"AI factories.\" Its guidance also calls for its business to continue its strong growth.\nThe company forecast revenue of around $28 billion, ahead of the consensus at $26.4 billion and equal to 107% year-over-year growth, or 7.5% growth sequentially.\nNvidia did everything the market asked for and more in the first quarter.

        "Text": "The Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares (SOXL) jumped 6% on Thursday amid a wider rally in tech stocks a day after mildly optimistic remarks by U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell calmed jittery markets.\nSOXL's gains recovered some ground lost\u2014it is down 21% over the past month\u2014as the largest holdings in its portfolio swooned, including Nvidia Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Qualcomm Inc.\nSOXL, consistently among the most actively-traded ETFs, seeks three times daily exposure from an index of 30 of the largest U.S.-listed semiconductor companies, including manufacturers and providers of equipment and services focused on the industry. The fund's index uses market cap-weighting, with the top five securities capped at 8% and the remaining securities at 4%.\nUntil the start of April, those companies soared over the past year as demand for chips used in artificial intelligence technology mushroomed, sweeping up funds focused on semiconductors. Despite its recent dip, SOXL has skyrocketed more than 187% over the past year, according to etf.com data. The single stock T-Rex 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF (NVDX) was the best-performing ETF in the first quarter of 2024, with a massive 205% return.\nBut the sector has struggled more recently as many investors took profits, including a sell-off of semiconductor stocks. Nvidia, the AI chip manufacturing giant, has fallen 3.5% over the past month to trade at $858 per share. Less than six weeks ago, it hit an all-time high over $950. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has plunged more than 19% since early April, despite rising more than 1% on Thursday. SOXL's holdings in each are the largest in its portfolio.\nOn Tuesday, the sector offered the latest evidence of its cooling with AMD reporting disappointing guidance for second quarter earnings and Super Micro Computer, which has gained significantly from the AI boom, falling short of analysts' projections for Q1 revenues. But other signs were more encouraging with Korean manufacturer and Nvidia supplier, SK Hynix, reporting that it had sold out of its high-bandwidth memory chips used in AI for 2024 and almost for 2025.\nActive ETFs May 2\nSource: etf.com\netf.com Senior Analyst Sumit Roy noted that \"semiconductor stocks took a breather in April after a rip-roaring AI-fueled rally sent them to record highs earlier this year.\"\n\"A disappointing earnings report from Intel and a tepid earnings report from AMD gave investors an excuse to take profits on chip stocks,\" he said. \"But still, excitement over AI will likely keep a bid under these stocks, especially with the juggernaut in the space, Nvidia, due to report earnings later this month.\"\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "Title": "Thanks, Nvidia: These 3 AI Crypto Tokens Are Up 132% or More This Year",
        "Author": "  Dominic Basulto, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) may have stalled out in the $60,000 to $65,000 range, but crypto investors can still find opportunities. Some newer crypto tokens with artificial intelligence (AI) connections are still buoyant, and some of them are up more than 132% for the year.\nA big reason for that has been the enormous enthusiasm around the artificial intelligence investment thesis. In the same way that equity investors have embraced Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), crypto investors are now embracing new crypto tokens they think could benefit the most from AI. With that in mind, here's a closer look at three of the most popular AI crypto tokens that have been seeing the biggest boosts lately.\nArguably, the most popular AI crypto token is Render (CRYPTO: RNDR) -- it's up 132% for the year. With a total market cap of $4.5 billion, Render now ranks as a top 25 cryptocurrency. Given its recent ascent, some investors now refer to Render as \"the Nvidia of crypto.\" As you might have guessed from the name, Render offers GPU-based rendering solutions for studios, artists, and creators.\nBut that's not why crypto investors are so excited about Render. The thinking now is that the same decentralized GPU computing power used for rendering can also be used for AI. If you want to train a large language model (LLM), for example, you will need a lot of \"GPU compute,\" which is the raw computing power required for modern AI solutions.\nSo it's easy to see why Render's performance is starting to look a lot like Nvidia's (which has become nearly synonymous with all things AI). Nvidia is the ultimate source of all that GPU-based computing power, whether it's used for rendering or AI.\nFetch.ai (CRYPTO: FET) is up a staggering 208% for the year and now ranks as a top 50 crypto by market cap. Fetch.ai is building what it refers to as an \"open, permissionless, decentralized machine learning network with a crypto economy.\" That's a mouthful, but it just means that Fetch.ai is a new platform for AI products and services. That includes large data sets for training LLMs and sophisticated AI bots known as agents.\nThe way that you pay for these AI products and services is with the Fetch.ai token. You can think of Fetch.ai as a digital currency for the emerging AI economy. Thus, the greater the demand for all things AI, the greater the demand for the Fetch.ai token.\nWhile there is obviously some demand for AI on a consumer level (who hasn't played around with AI chatbots?), the real demand will come from companies looking to undergo AI transformations. That's where Nvidia comes into the picture because these companies are often using Nvidia's products for new AI-related projects.\nAccording to Fetch.ai, the highest growth opportunities are in sectors such as logistics, transportation, and smart energy grids. As proof of its growing industry focus, Fetch.ai recently partnered with German companies Bosch and Deutsche Telekom on an AI platform.\nSince 2017, Bosch has partnered with Nvidia on AI-powered self-driving cars, so that could be just one example of an area where Fetch.ai gets a huge boost. In the past, Deutsche Telekom has partnered with Nvidia on \"smart city\" concepts, so that might be another area.\nFinally, there's SingularityNET (CRYPTO: AGIX), which is up an eye-popping 193% for the year. It now ranks as a top 75 cryptocurrency, with a $1.2 billion market cap. However, since it's not available for trading on popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), it may not be suitable for all crypto investors.\nIn terms of overall AI strategy, SingularityNET is hitting it out of the park. It is pushing forward the idea of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is leaps and bounds ahead of the current version of AI, known as generative AI (best known as the variety that includes ChatGPT).\nIn fact, according to futurists like Ray Kurzweil (now at Google), AGI implies a future in which a single computer will be smarter than all humans combined. It will have access to all human knowledge ever created and, as a result, will be able to create truly innovative solutions. To power that level of AI, it will probably require a lot of Nvidia GPUs.\nAs long as Nvidia's stock performance continues to impress, it's safe to say that investors will be on the lookout for crypto tokens most likely to benefit from the enthusiasm around AI. For investors who think that Nvidia is the one AI stock they need to own, then it also makes sense to focus on AI crypto tokens with indirect or direct ties to Nvidia.\nHowever, just keep in mind that AI is still a relatively new industry, and trends can come and go. Plenty of companies claim to be \"the next Nvidia,\" so it's likely the AI investment thesis will change and evolve over time. For now, though, the three crypto tokens highlighted above appear to be doing the best job of benefiting from the new enthusiasm around AI.\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Bitcoin wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jamie Nimmo ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- US chipmaker Nvidia Corp. is investing in Wayve Technologies Ltd., joining a $1.05 billion funding round for the UK startup that wants to get its autonomous-driving technology into cars.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMicrosoft\u2019s Xbox Is Planning More Cuts After Studio Closings\nAmericans Are Racking Up \u2018Phantom Debt\u2019 That Wall Street Can\u2019t Track\nArm Slides as Tepid Outlook Fuels Concerns Over AI Slowdown\nStormy Daniels Will Return to Court in Test of Trump\u2019s Demeanor\nThe raise \u2014 one of the largest ever for a European artificial intelligence company \u2014 was led by SoftBank Group Corp., with existing investor Microsoft Corp. putting in further funds. The valuation was not disclosed.\nThe cash injection underscores the continued investor demand for AI, and is a boost for the self-driving car industry, which has suffered setbacks in recent years in its efforts to convince regulators driverless cars are safe.\nWayve wants carmakers and other fleet operators to install its technology into their vehicles, rather than own or operate the cars itself. The company received interest from several car companies about investing, but decided not to close off its options in future by partnering with a single manufacturer, Chief Executive Officer Alex Kendall said in an interview at Wayve\u2019s headquarters in London.\nTalks are continuing with automakers about rolling out the technology in their vehicles, he added.\nRead More: Microsoft-Backed Self-Driving Startup Wayve Expands to Vancouver\nKendall, who founded Wayve in 2017, plans to begin with driver-assist technology \u2014 which will still require someone behind the wheel \u2014 before targeting vehicles that can operate without any human involvement.\nCompeting with the likes of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo, Wayve\u2019s technology aims to learn driving rules and patterns on its own, rather than needing them to be programmed in, so it can respond to new places and unpredictable scenarios on the road.\nOther autonomous-driving companies have faced setbacks. Last October, a woman in San Francisco was dragged under a vehicle operated by Cruise, General Motors Co.\u2019s self-driving unit, after she was hit by a human driver in a different car. The accident and subsequent withholding of evidence led to Cruise being stripped of its permit and having its cars recalled.\nIn 2022, Argo AI shut down after backer Ford Motor Co. decided it needed to invest in driver-assistance technology that was more achievable in the near term. Uber Technologies Inc. also sold off its driverless car unit in 2020.\nNew Staff\nThe funds raised will be spent on new staff and computing. The startup had already raised more than $258 million from investors including Eclipse Ventures LLC, Balderton Capital, Baillie Gifford & Co., D1 Capital Partners, Moore Strategic Ventures LLC, Virgin and Ocado Group Plc.\nLast year, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates was filmed testing Wayve\u2019s system in central London with Kendall.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said the funding showed the UK is an AI superpower.\nThis should be the last time the company raises a large chunk of money as it starts to profit from commercial deals, Kendall said. The business model is to charge car companies a license fee to use the technology.\nThe company announced plans last month to open a research center in Vancouver to accelerate its growth. It is Wayve\u2019s third location after London and Mountain View, California.\n--With assistance from Mark Bergen.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags\nTim Cook Can\u2019t Run Apple Forever.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Since early last year, it's become crystal clear that advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are causing a paradigm shift in technology. Nowhere is that more evident than in the list of companies that are among the world's most valuable, measured in terms of market cap.\nMicrosoft made headlines over the past year or so with its definitive moves in generative AI and is currently the only company with a market cap above $3 trillion. Apple has been toying with AI for years, and while it ceded its market cap crown to Microsoft, it continues to cling stubbornly to second place, worth $2.9 trillion. Nvidia has moved up the ranks quickly thanks to its industry-leading AI-centric computer chips, currently worth $2.3 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms round out the other top 10 AI players, with market caps of between $2.1 trillion and $1.2 trillion.\nWith a market cap of roughly $789 billion (as of this writing), it seems clear that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), often referred to as TSMC, is bucking for membership in this elite fraternity. Given the accelerating demand for the semiconductors needed for AI, TSMC's admittance might come sooner than later.\nAs the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC is in an enviable position in the industry. The company doesn't make semiconductors for its own use, but rather is contracted to make them for big tech companies, including Nvidia, Arm Holdings, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple, among others.\nOnce upon a time, the bulk of TSMC's revenue came from processors used in smartphones, but high-performance computing (HPC), which includes chips used for AI, has taken the top spot, recently accounting for 46% of revenue.\nBusiness is picking up. In the first quarter, revenue climbed 16.5% to $18.9 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $1.38 edged 5% higher. Management is expecting its accelerating growth to continue, forecasting second-quarter revenue of $20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent growth of 28%.\nTSMC is in an enviable position in the AI revolution. It's a foundry partner to the AI stars, and since it makes chips for all comers, it's not a part of the fierce competition for AI chip supremacy. Given its position in the space and its current size, I don't think it will take very long to join the society of trillionaires.\nAccording to Wall Street, TSMC is poised to generate revenue of $84.8 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 9.3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, TSM would have to grow its revenue to roughly $107 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nInterestingly, Wall Street is forecasting revenue growth of 22% in both 2024 and 2025. If the company achieves those fairly reasonable benchmarks, it could easily achieve a $1 trillion market cap by 2026.\nThere could be much more to come. TSM's management expects the company's AI-related revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 50% over the coming five years and account for 20% of TSM's total revenue by 2028.\nThat's not surprising, considering the magnitude of the opportunity. Generative AI is expected to generate economic value of between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually over the coming decade, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. However, estimates continue to ratchet higher as more applications for AI join the mix.\nFinally, at just 24 times forward earnings, TSMC is attractively priced, giving investors an inexpensive way to profit from the AI revolution.\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Artificial Intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) is increasingly emerging as a pivotal force shaping the future of technology. As a key player in the AI revolution, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been leading the list of AI stocks to buy. The tech giant is renowned for its graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional markets. Wall Street also focuses on its system-on-a-chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive markets.\nThis week, the spotlight is on the NVDA stock as it is reporting earnings. Nvidia\u2019s stock has been a focal point among investors, due to its remarkable performance over the few past years, but especially since 2023. NVDA\u2019s success can be traced back to its strategic focus on some of the most transformative technologies, including AI, deep learning and autonomous vehicles. Powering breakthroughs in machine learning and data science, its GPUs have become indispensable.\nHowever, the AI stocks to buy extend beyond Nvidia. The market is expansive and growing, with many companies vying for a share of the lucrative pie. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global AI market size stood at $196.6 billion in 2023. In addition, it could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6% from 2024 to 2030. This growth should be propelled by increasing data volume and the adoption of cloud-based applications and services. There has also been a surge in demand for intelligent virtual assistants.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nAs the AI industry continues to burgeon, several other companies are making their presence felt and are ready to challenge Nvidia. These companies are not just competitors. They are also potential game-changers, ready to steal the spotlight with their innovative AI solutions. In this article, we will explore three such AI stocks to buy.\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\nAmong the AI stocks to buy, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) could appeal to long-term investors. The software company specializes in big data analytics for government agencies and commercial clients. Their \u201cFoundry\u201d platform integrates and analyzes large, complex datasets, making PLTR a top contender among AI stocks to buy.\nInvestors have been eyeing Palantir for its potential to capitalize on AI, used in everything from fraud detection to national security. The AI play released the financial metrics for the first quarter 2024 at the beginning of May. Revenue grew 21% year-over-year (YOY) to $634 million, driven by strong performance in its U.S. commercial business, which saw a 40% increase. Adjusted earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) was 8 cents.\nIn a move to empower businesses and governments globally, tech giants Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Palantir are working together. By combining Oracle\u2019s robust cloud infrastructure with Palantir\u2019s cutting-edge AI and data analysis tools, the partnership aims to unlock the full potential of data for organizations. This could translate to improved efficiency, meeting data sovereignty needs and gaining a competitive edge.\nAs a result, PLTR stock is up 28% year-to-date (YTD). The company\u2019s profitability metrics are impressive. However, its valuation metrics indicate high expectations, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 171x and a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 21x. Meanwhile, the 12-month median price forecast for PLTR is $22.00, presenting an upside potential of 3.6% from current levels. Therefore, interested readers may wait for a potential decline toward the $20 level before loading up on PLTR stock.\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\nThe next company on our list of AI stocks to buy is SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN). The company focuses on the voice AI segment, having made significant strides in enhancing conversational experiences. Its conversational interfaces include automatic speech recognition, natural language understanding and voice-enabled commerce solutions.\nOn May 9, SoundHound released first quarter 2024 financial metrics. Revenues grew 73% YOY to $11.6 million, but the adjusted loss per share was 7 cents. The company raised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance to between $65 million and $77 million, anticipating continued growth. SoundHound\u2019s management remains optimistic about achieving a revenue milestone of $100 million and reaching adjusted EBITDA profitability by 2025.\nMeanwhile, SoundHound AI has strategically partnered with Nvidia and Perplexity to enhance and expand its voice AI capabilities. These partnerships aim to integrate SoundHound\u2019s conversational AI technologies with Nvidia\u2019s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle applications and incorporate Perplexity\u2019s large language models to improve the accuracy of SoundHound\u2019s AI solutions. Investors are hopeful that the collaborations could drive innovation and monetization, significantly impacting SoundHound\u2019s market presence and technological advancement.\nSo far in the year, SOUN stock has returned 146% YTD, showcasing a strong positive market sentiment towards its future prospects. However, valuation remains expensive as SOUN shares are changing hands at 25.5 times sales. Yet Wall Street\u2019s median price forecast stands at $7.00, suggesting an upside potential of\u00a0over 36%.\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\nWe conclude our discussion of AI stocks to buy with Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER). The company is one of the most important names in testing equipment for semiconductors, wireless products and industrial automation solutions.\nTeradyne\u2019s management released first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings in late April. Investors noted the continued weakness in mobility. Yet robust memory and networking demand driven by AI applications drove financial performance above the high end of guidance. Going forward, further growth in the semiconductor industry is expected to gain traction, benefiting Teradyne as a provider of testing equipment.\nIn 2024, management is anticipating a 500% increase in the high-bandwidth memory test market. The growth will likely be driven by AI tailwinds for semiconductor testing. Analysts note that the increasing complexity of semiconductor testing should continue to drive Teradyne\u2019s margin expansion and profit growth in the long term as well.\nAs a result, since January, TER stock has advanced 33.8%.\u00a0Shares are changing hands at a forward P/E ratio of 44x and a trailing sales ratio of 7.5x. We would wait for a pullback and look to buy Terradyne stock around $130.\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil has both long and short positions in NVDA.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If there was any doubt about the strength of the AI boom in the stock market and the broader economy, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) just put those questions to rest.\nFor the first quarter of 2024, the AI chip titan just posted another blockbuster earnings report, including\u00a0year-over-year revenue growth of 262% overall and 427% in the data center segment, where the AI revolution is taking place.\nThose numbers weren't a huge surprise to those that have been following the stock, but they were still better than expected as was the company's guidance for the second quarter. It was enough to add roughly $200 billion to Nvidia's market cap.\nHowever, what really stoked excitement for the artificial intelligence revolution was commentary from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, indicating that growth in the AI market was still in its early stages and that demand was still soaring, outstripping supply.\nFor example, Nvidia noted that 40% of data center revenue was the result of AI inference, meaning that training, the other key component of creating generative AI models, likely made up a majority of data center revenue in the quarter. The company said that both training and inference were growing \"significantly.\"\nThat's important, because inference is expected to eventually be a much larger part of data center demand than training since inference is the part that comes after training. If AI inference demand is still smaller than AI training demand currently, then that means the companies and organizations using generative AI are still in the very early stages of scaling generative AI demand.\nRunning generative AI models consumes enormous amounts of power, and the issue has mostly gone overlooked thus far in the generative AI boom. Predictions about generative AI power consumption vary, but some say it will impact the electrical grid in ways not seen since the spread of central air conditioning in the 1960s. According to Goldman Sachs, data center power demand is expected to grow 160% by 2030.\nIf those estimates are accurate, the real winners in the AI-driven energy crunch are likely to include the power suppliers themselves, meaning utility companies like Dominion Energy (NYSE: D).\nNearly all of Dominion Energy's profit comes from Virginia, where it enjoys a regulated monopoly in utilities. The company's annual report says that it faces no competition for electric distribution service and \"no such competition is currently permitted.\"\nThat's significant, because Virginia is a major market for data centers. In fact, Northern Virginia is the largest data center market in the world, and the state has roughly 35% of hyperscale data centers worldwide globally. These are the data centers that belong to some of Nvidia's biggest cloud computing customers like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Alphabet's Google Cloud Services.\nAs those companies ramp up their AI data center operations, Dominion looks poised to benefit. On a recent earnings call, management noted, \"Northern Virginia leads the world in data center markets. In recent years, this growth has accelerated in orders of magnitude.\"\nInvestors primarily own utility stocks for their dividends, as these recession-proof companies tend to be reliable income stocks.\nHowever, most utility stocks have fallen over the last couple of years; rising interest rates have caused dividend investors to park their money in bonds instead, as treasuries are now paying more than 5%. You can see that weakness reflected in Dominion's performance over the last three years.\nThe stock is down 33% over the last three years, even as the S&P 500 index has surged to new all-time highs.\nDominion currently offers a 5% dividend yield, making it appealing as an income stock. Investors who buy the stock now can capitalize on the recovery in the share price as interest rates are expected to fall later this year, and they should also benefit from growth in data center demand over the longer term in Dominion's home market of Virginia.\nBuying Dominion stock now could prove to be an excellent way to capitalize on the boom in generative AI.\nBefore you buy stock in Dominion Energy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Dominion Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Chuck Mikolajczak\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nasdaq closed at a record high on Monday while the S&P 500 gained slightly as technology stocks advanced ahead of Nvidia's highly anticipated earnings and investors gauged the timing of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.\nThe S&P 500 technology index led gains among the 11 major S&P sectors, rising 1.32%, helped by chipmakers such as Nvidia, which advanced 2.49% ahead of its quarterly results on Wednesday.\nInvestors will look for evidence in Nvidia's earnings that the AI chip leader can maintain its explosive growth and stay ahead of rivals.\nAt least three brokerages lifted their Nvidia price targets, while peer Micron Technology climbed 2.96% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the memory chipmaker to \"equal-weight\" from \"underweight.\" The PHLX semiconductor index rose 2.15%.\n\"If they surprise to the upside Nvidia could spark a mini fury, although everything's kind of expensive, so it's hard to see a big move up about it,\" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.\n\"If the Fed starts to lower rates, that would really spark a rally but it doesn't seem like the data supports that yet.\"\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 196.82 points, or 0.49%, to 39,806.77.

The blue-chip Dow closed above 40,000 points for the first time last week.\nComments from Fed officials on Monday did little to alter expectations for cuts by the central bank, as they were reluctant to say inflation pressures were easing and several stressed the need for caution.\nMinutes of the Fed's latest monetary policy meeting are scheduled to be released on Wednesday. Markets are pricing in a 63.3% chance for a cut of at least 25 basis points (bps) at the September meeting, the CME's FedWatch Tool showed.\nThe recent rally has started to raise concerns about stock valuations, with the S&P 500 trading at a forward price-to-earning ratio of 20.8, well above its historic average of 15.9, according to LSEG data.\nDeutsche Bank raised its 2024 year-end S&P 500 target to 5,500 from 5,100 points, the highest among major brokerages, while Morgan Stanley forecast it would hit 5,400 by June 2025.\nNorwegian Cruise Line surged 7.56% after lifting its annual profit forecast.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.14-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.01-to-1 ratio.\nThe S&P 500 posted 58 new 52-week highs and four new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 222 new highs and 101 new lows.\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 12.31 billion shares, compared with the 11.82 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Richard Chang)\n"

        "Author": "  Chloe Berger ",
        "Text": "Surrounded by moss, in a boiling valley with not a breeze to be seen or felt, Jensen Huang stumbled upon an unlikely mentor while off the beaten path.\n\u201cAnybody who\u2019s been to Kyoto knows how incredibly hot it is during the summer,\u201d Huang said at the Chinese American Semiconductor Professional Association in 2023, speaking of his time in a temple in the city, which hosts the most extensive collection of moss in the world. There, Huang received the best career advice.\nInside the temple was an old man, \u201csquatted down, working on the moss.\u201d Tourists passed by him, as did Huang and his family. But Huang suddenly stopped, noticing that the man was tending to the garden with a bamboo tweezer and a bamboo basket with, at most, three tiny pieces of dead moss inside it.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Huang asked.\n\u201cAnd, he says he is taking care of his garden,\u201d Huang remembered. After the Nvidia CEO inquired, the man added that he had been working there for almost 30 years.\nLooking at his tools, Huang pushed further, wondering how the elderly man was able to tend such a big garden with such small tools. \u201cHe said something that is perfect, he said \u2018I have plenty of time,\u2019\u201d Huang recalls.\n\u201cThat's the best career advice I can give you,\u201d Huang says. \u201cMost of the time, I wait for things to come to me. I\u2019m rarely chasing things.\u201d\nThe gardener\u2019s words\u2014 and Huang\u2019s interpretation\u2014could also be seen as a reference to French Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire, whose satirical novella and masterpiece \u201cCandide\u201d offers the lesson that one must cultivate their own garden and find fulfillment through productive work. The 18th century thought leader would likely have a thing or two to say about the 17th wealthiest person in the world trying to emulate his philosophy. \u201cThe comfort of the rich depends upon an abundant supply of the poor,\u201d Voltaire once said.\nEven if he claims to not be chasing success, the CEO has found a great deal of it while riding the AI wave. Coming off an incredibly strong quarter, Nvidia has even other business leaders giving them creds.\n\u201cThese two numbers have never been next to each other in the history of capitalism,\u201d Box CEO Aaron Levie tweeted regarding the company\u2019s released revenue and data-center category\u2019s percentage growth. And Huang has profited immensely off of his company\u2019s achievements, his net worth surging to $90 billion in light of recent stock performance.\nLooking back on his long stretch of time at Nvidia and the gardner\u2019s ethos, he offers a kernel of advice\u2014\u201cdedicate yourself to learning all the time, doing the best possible work you can,\u201d\nWhether or not it\u2019s authentic, Huang tells a story of trying to stay grounded and give himself fully to the moment, choosing to go watchless, in part, because of this desire. It might be unlikely that a billionaire executive who is running the new era of tech is truly able to stay at peace, but Huang is attempting to.\n\u201cI\u2019m focused on now. I\u2019m enjoying my job,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the longest running tech CEO in the world. I am largely unemployable now, and thank goodness I enjoyed my job.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Notable, given that Nvidia's stock split also came alongside a 150% increase in its dividend.\nAnd while commentary from its CEO, Jensen Huang, that demand for its chips remains robust while profits and sales rose more than 400% and 200%, respectively, would suggest Nvidia remains in good standing, business cycles often ebb and flow more quickly than the rate at which companies change how they reward shareholders.\nNvidia's new dividend will see its annual payment to shareholders rise from $395 million in its most recent fiscal year to nearly $1 billion annually. A pittance, some might say, for a company that had free cash flow of nearly $15 billion in its most recent quarter.\nAnd given the performance of Nvidia's stock in recent history \u2014 shares are up over 2,600% in the last five years against a 120% gain for the Nasdaq \u2014 the company appears to have little trouble incentivizing investors to own its stock.\nBut no level of shareholder return goes unnoticed by investors.\nThe dividend hike is a notable increase in how much Nvidia has committed to regularly pay out to shareholders.\nA commitment that typically only reverses during a company's most dire moments \u2014 indicating Nvidia is moving further away from contemplating any downsides of the present AI boom.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Author": "  Collin Brantmeyer, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Ahead of Chipotle Mexican Grill's planned 50-for-1 stock split, investors may be wondering which stock could be next.\nOne candidate is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), whose stock has skyrocketed 230% over the past year and is now hovering around $950 per share. So, let's explore why a company might split its stock, Nvidia's history of stock splits, and whether investors should buy the chipmaker.\nA stock split is a corporate action in which a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares, effectively increasing the outstanding shares while maintaining the same market capitalization. This results in its shareholders receiving more shares, while their ownership stake and the total value of their investment remain unchanged.\nFor instance, if an investor holds five shares of a company priced at $1,000 per share and the company executes a 10-for-1 stock split, the investor would then own 50 shares priced at $100 each, with the total investment value remaining at $5,000.\nWhile many brokerages let retail investors purchase fractional shares, others, like Vanguard, don't offer this option. So, when a stock like Nvidia trades at a high price, it might become too expensive for many potential investors. Having a lower share price could make a stock more affordable, potentially leading to more demand for the company's shares, which may increase its overall market capitalization.\nAnother benefit is that a lower stock price can help attract and keep talented workers. Nvidia co-founder, president, and CEO Jensen Huang supports this reasoning, saying it provides workers greater flexibility in their ownership of company stock through compensation or stock plans.\nNvidia is no stranger to stock splits. Since going public in 1999, it has split its stock on five occasions, all under Huang. The company's most recent one, a 4-for-1 split, happened in July 2021.\nNotably, when the company announced its last stock split, its stock traded near $600 per share, well below its current price of $950 per share.\nWhen Jim Cramer asked about it in March, Huang said, \"We'll think about it,\" and reiterated why he likes the practice, saying: \"It's a good thing. We want to make sure we take care of our employees.\"\nAlthough stock splits may spark interest, investors are advised to refrain from basing their investment decisions solely on this factor. Instead, the company's financial performance and management's guidance wield far greater influence on its long-term stock performance.\nIn Nvidia's fiscal 2024, the company generated $60.9 billion in revenue and $29.8 billion in net income, an improvement of 126% and 581%, respectively, compared to its fiscal 2023. The meteoric rises were largely driven by the growing demand for its expensive H100 chip, which is the engine behind the generative artificial intelligence boom.\nHuang summed up the unprecedented fiscal year by saying in the company's fourth-quarter earnings release: \"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\"\nNvidia's management guided for roughly $24 billion in revenue for fiscal Q1 2025, which would represent a 234% year-over-year increase. Also, management projected its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) gross margin to be between 76.3% and 77%, resulting in a significant year-over-year increase from 64.6%. Anytime a company can increase its gross margin, it displays its pricing power, which Nvidia has in its industry-leading chips.\nNo matter how quickly a company is growing, investors still need to pay attention to valuation to ensure that they do not overpay for its stock. For a mature company like Nvidia, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a standard valuation metric that looks at a company's stock price compared to its trailing 12 months of earnings. As of this writing, Nvidia trades at 79.3 times trailing earnings, higher than its five-year median of 71.9. However, if you look at Nvidia's forward P/E ratio, which compares the stock price to the company's expected earnings over the next 12 months, its stock trades at a more reasonable 37.6.\nWhile value investors may scoff at Nvidia's valuation, considering the average trailing P/E ratio of the S&P 500 is 23.2 times earnings, it's important to underscore that the unprecedented growth that Nvidia has seen in terms of sheer revenue and net income over the past year. For those reasons, coupled with the continued growth of generative artificial intelligence, long-term growth investors should consider buying or adding to Nvidia. Investors can always implement a dollar-cost averaging strategy to build a position over time without the stress of short-term volatility.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Chloe Berger ",
        "Text": "Don\u2019t ask Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang for the time; he isn\u2019t keeping it.\nIt\u2019s perhaps surprising that one of the tech world\u2019s most prominent figures is going through life without checking the clock. But there\u2019s a method to Huang's madness, and likely a phone where he keeps tabs on what hour it is.\n\u201cVery few people know this, but I don\u2019t wear a watch,\u201d he said at the Chinese American Semiconductor Professional Association in 2023. \u201cNow is the most important time, just dedicate yourself to now,\u201d Huang declared.\nIt might be especially easy to stay in the now as Nvidia continues its winning streak. Demand remains so high that Nvidia is now set to make new AI chips on a yearly basis. The company announced Wednesday that its second-quarter revenue hit almost $28 billion, exceeding projections. Solidifying itself as a giant to be reckoned with, Nvidia profited more during the first quarter of 2024 than other big names like Amazon and JPMorgan, notes Axios.\nOf course, while Huang is trying to stay in the moment, the nature of his job means he\u2019s always looking to the future. When it comes to chips, the company \u201cexpect[s] demand may exceed supply well into the next year,\u201d Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said.\nNvidia's continued success only fuels the narrative that AI is set to change the future of technology. \u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun,\u201d he said in a conference call. \u201cAI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient, while expanding revenue opportunities.\u201d\nBut even if his sector is demanding, Huang is trying to stay above the fray. That\u2019s how he\u2019s been at the helm for so long, after all, serving 31 years in the CEO role after cofounding the company 1993. \u201cI don't have a watch. I\u2019m focused on now. I\u2019m enjoying my job,\u201d he said, as Tom\u2019s Hardware reported.\nAnd a timepiece particularity isn\u2019t the only quirk that Huang has when it comes to his uniform. The bare-wristed CEO has taken to donning an all-black fit usually capped off with a black leather jacket. He\u2019s been wearing these jackets \u201cfor at least 20 years,\u201d a spokesperson told the New York Times. It\u2019s part of his knock-off Matrix-reminiscent style, creating a continuity and (pricey) simplicity that some compare to the turtleneck that became synonymous with Steve Jobs.\nLooks aside, Huang\u2019s choice to go sans watch might have greater legs in the tech world.\nEarly on in his career, Jeff Bezos, founder and former CEO of Amazon, echoed the sentiment that you're only as good as your last move. \u201cI believe that our customers are loyal to us right up until the second that somebody else offers them better service,\u201d he said in a 1999 interview with CNET\u2019s Wendy Walsh.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Let's talk about the popular NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s take a look at NVIDIA\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nNVIDIA appears to be expensive according to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 65.77x is currently well-above the industry average of 30.09x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that NVIDIA\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. NVIDIA's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NVDA\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NVDA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Did you analyze how Nvidia (NVDA) fared in its international operations for the quarter ending April 2024? Given the widespread global presence of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence, scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities.\nIn the modern, closely-knit global economic landscape, the capacity of a business to access foreign markets is often a key determinant of its financial well-being and growth path. Investors now place great importance on grasping the extent of a company's dependence on international markets, as it sheds light on the firm's earnings stability, its skill in leveraging various economic cycles and its broad growth potential.\nBeing present in foreign markets serves as protection against local economic declines and helps benefit from more rapidly expanding economies. Yet, such expansion also introduces challenges related to currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varied market behaviors.\nWhile delving into NVDA's performance for the past quarter, we observed some fascinating trends in the revenue from its foreign segments that are commonly modeled and observed by analysts on Wall Street.\nThe recent quarter saw the company's total revenue reaching $26.04 billion, marking an improvement of 262.1% from the prior-year quarter. Next, we'll examine the breakdown of NVDA's revenue from abroad to comprehend the significance of its international presence.\nA Closer Look at NVDA's Revenue Streams Abroad\nOther countries accounted for 6.3% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $1.65 billion. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -59.96%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $4.11 billion. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Other countries contributed $7.99 billion (36.2%) and $659 million (9.2%) to the total revenue, respectively.\nDuring the quarter, China (including Hong Kong) contributed $2.49 billion in revenue, making up 9.6% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $4.41 billion, this meant a surprise of -43.48%. Looking back, China (including Hong Kong) contributed $1.95 billion, or 8.8%, in the previous quarter, and $1.59 billion, or 22.1%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\nOf the total revenue, $4.37 billion came from Taiwan during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 16.8%. This represented a surprise of -19.01% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $5.4 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $4.44 billion, or 20.1%, and $1.8 billion, or 25%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\nInternational Market Revenue Projections\nFor the current fiscal quarter, it is anticipated by Wall Street analysts that Nvidia will report a total revenue of $28.25 billion, which reflects an increase of 109.1% from the same quarter in the previous year. The revenue contributions are expected to be 15.9% from Other countries ($4.49 billion), 15.5% from China (including Hong Kong) ($4.39 billion) and 20.5% from Taiwan ($5.8 billion).\nFor the full year, the company is expected to generate $116.4 billion in total revenue, up 91.1% from the previous year. Revenues from Other countries, China (including Hong Kong) and Taiwan are expected to constitute 14.9% ($17.33 billion), 15% ($17.4 billion) and 19.5% ($22.66 billion) of the total, respectively.\nFinal Thoughts\nRelying on international markets for revenues, Nvidia faces both prospects and perils. Thus, tracking the company's international revenue trends is essential for accurately projecting its future trajectory.\nIn a world where international interdependencies and geopolitical conflicts are ever-increasing, Wall Street analysts closely monitor these trends for companies having international presence to adjust their earnings forecasts. Of course, there are several other factors, including a company's standing within its home borders, that influence analysts' earnings forecasts.\nHere at Zacks, we put a great deal of emphasis on a company's changing earnings outlook, as empirical research has shown that's a powerful force driving a stock's near-term price performance. Quite naturally, the correlation is positive here -- an upward revision in earnings estimates drives the stock price higher.\nBoasting a remarkable track record that's been externally verified, the Zacks Rank, our unique stock rating system, leverages changes in earnings projections to function as a reliable gauge for predicting short-term stock price movements.\nNvidia, bearing a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is expected to outperform the broader market's movements in the near term.

        "Title": "With 67% ownership in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Significantly high institutional ownership implies NVIDIA's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\nThe top 25 shareholders own 44% of the company\n Insiders have sold recently \nEvery investor in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 67% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nAnd last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$2.3t in market cap. The one-year return on investment is currently 173% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of NVIDIA, beginning with the chart below.\n See our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\nNVIDIA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in NVIDIA. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. With 7.4% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and FMR LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. In addition, we found that Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO has 3.5% of the shares allocated to their name.\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in NVIDIA Corporation. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$93b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. \nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 29% stake in NVIDIA. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for NVIDIA  that you should be aware of.\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "Text": "Those who invested in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) a few years ago are sitting pretty right now. The tech giant has seen its shares skyrocket, even more so than its otherwise high-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, partly thanks to its artificial intelligence (AI) system sales.\nHowever, as is often the case with stocks that crush the market, some investors are now worried about valuation. With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 35 -- where the average for the S&P 500 is 20 -- Nvidia's shares don't exactly look cheap.\nThe premium might be justified if the chipmaker continues delivering the kinds of results it has lately, but for investors who want a cheaper Magnificent Seven stock that can also allow them to profit from the AI boom, let's consider why Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a solid option.\nThe rise of generative AI leader ChatGPT initially spooked Alphabet's shareholders. Some saw the technology as being a Google killer. Alphabet generates the bulk of its revenue from ads on Google, so if it loses significant market share in online search, its financial results will worsen considerably.\nThis is a reasonable fear, but Alphabet wasn't worried. The company has been implementing AI within its business for years, including in updates to its Google algorithms.\nAlphabet quickly released its ChatGPT competitor, Bard, which has since been rebranded as Gemini. Alphabet's Gemini goes beyond text generation into videos, images, and computer coding. The company is still improving Gemini and other AI models it has developed while integrating various AI features throughout its business to make it more efficient and productive, from online search to advertising services.\nThe result should be stronger top-line growth and operating margins. Alphabet also offers various AI services through its cloud business, Google Cloud. As company CEO Sundar Pichai said during Alphabet's first-quarter earnings conference call:\nOur differentiation in Cloud begins with our AI Hypercomputer, which provides efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to train and serve models. Today, more than 60% of funded gen AI start-ups and nearly 90% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers.\nThe race to develop more sophisticated generative AI platforms should be a growth driver for Alphabet.\nAlphabet's forward price-to-earning (P/E) ratio is just under 22, which is still higher than the S&P 500's average but much lower than Nvidia's. Perhaps Alphabet's comparatively low P/E reflects the fact that it isn't growing as fast. Still, the business is solid and continues to deliver strong financial results. In the first quarter, the company's total revenue of $80.5 billion increased by a healthy 15.4% year over year.\nAlphabet's operating margin landed at 32%, higher than the 25% generated in the prior-year quarter, while its net earnings per share of $1.89 was 61.5% higher. Alphabet has other growth drivers beyond AI, including in streaming with YouTube. The website is the leader in streaming in terms of watch time, though it isn't exactly comparable to platforms like Netflix that offer movies and TV shows.\nStill, the increase in viewing time is a magnet for advertisers who will continue to flock to the platform so long as YouTube remains a leader, something that shouldn't change anytime soon. YouTube benefits from the network effect: The more content creators on the platform, the more it becomes attractive to viewers, and vice versa. Alphabet should still have a long runway for growth in this area.\nLastly, the company recently announced it was initiating a quarterly dividend per share of $0.20. And for what it's worth, the tech giant will also repurchase $70 billion worth of its shares.\nWill Alphabet become a great dividend stock in time? It's too early to tell. However, given the company's solid underlying business, strong cash flow generation, and multiple growth avenues, it has the tools to be an excellent dividend payer. Incidentally, these qualities also make the stock a great buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the biggest investment areas among artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities is data centers. Applications in generative AI are fueling a new wave of demand for cloud storage, server racks, network infrastructure, and more.\nWhile Nvidia is a major provider of data center services, other players are emerging with formidable solutions. Moreover, even big tech giants, such as Amazon, are investing significant sums into building their own data centers. Savvy investors understand that there are a host of opportunities making inroads in the growing data center realm -- a market expected to reach nearly $440 billion by 2028, according to Statista.\nStock analyst and media personality Jim Cramer recently named Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG) as a top pick for data center services. While this may seem a bit out of the ordinary, Constellation Energy is currently discussing some interesting partnerships and could very well emerge as a big winner of the AI data center boom.\nBelow is an exploration of how the company could play a major role in the data center arena and whether now is a good time to scoop up some shares.\nData centers act as storage units for IT architecture and network infrastructure. These buildings house larger server racks that are filled with hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used for accelerated computing.\nWhile data centers play an integral role in the AI ecosystem, there's one big drawback: Data centers use a lot of electricity.\nAccording to the Department of Energy, data centers use anywhere between 10 to 50 times more energy than a standard commercial office. This translates into roughly 2% of the total electricity consumption in the U.S.\nResearch from Goldman Sachs suggests that data center power demand will increase at a 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030 -- at which point it would reach approximately 8% of total power demand in the U.S. by 2030.\nConsidering that the secular tailwinds fueling AI are directly correlated to rising energy consumption -- electricity, in particular -- data centers are in need of an alternative solution sooner rather than later. Constellation Energy might just have the answer.\nThe company operates across many aspects of the energy industry including solar, wind, and natural gas. But another solution Constellation Energy brings to the table is nuclear power. And the best part? Big tech is interested.\nDuring Constellation Energy's most recent earnings call, management alluded that the company is in discussions with \"Magnificent Seven\" members Microsoft and Alphabet about potentially partnering on nuclear-powered data centers.\nFurthermore, Goldman affirmed rising interest in nuclear power, calling it \"an attractive generation source for data centers given it is zero carbon and reliable.\"\nAs of the time of this writing, Constellation Energy was trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.4 -- well above the S&P 500's P/E of 24.8.\nFurthermore, after benchmarking Constellation Energy against other regulated utilities, the company appears to be trading at a premium relative to some of its competitors.\nWhile Constellation Energy might be pricey compared to other utilities, I see the company as an under-the-radar opportunity among AI investments. Although there will be obvious investment choices among big tech and peripheral competitors in IT infrastructure, energy stocks shouldn't be forgotten when it comes to AI.\nFor this reason, Constellation Energy might be seen as a better value compared to many technology stocks which have seen valuation multiples expand dramatically over the last year as AI tailwinds have fueled buying activity.\nConsidering nuclear power is garnering the interest of the biggest AI enterprises, I wouldn't overlook the energy sector, in general.\nGiven Constellation Energy's relationship with big tech and its capabilities at the intersection of data center services and nuclear power, I see the stock as an attractive buying opportunity for long-term investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Constellation Energy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Constellation Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Jim Cramer has been a big believer in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), recommending the stock almost every week since late 2023. However, amid the recent lackluster performance of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Cramer sounded a bit disappointed, saying the stock now seems to \u201crally far less than it goes down.\u201d\nHowever, Cramer reiterated that he believes NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a stock to own, not trade.\nDespite concerns around valuation, Wall Street continues to shower positive ratings on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Recently, Wells Fargo\u2019s Aaron Rakers increased his price target for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $1,150 from $970, citing data center strengths.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) bulls believe the company is just getting started since we are in a very early stage of AI adaption phase where companies are testing their AI products. \u00a0NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is currently the leader in the AI chips industry with an 84% market share.\nDon't Miss: 11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now According to Hedge Funds\nAs of the end of the last quarter of 2023, 173 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA). The most significant stake in NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is owned by Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners which owns a $6.8 billion stake in NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA).\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThis quarter we entered two new positions, while exiting four positions. Our first new position was\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), which we bought early in the quarter.\u00a0Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has\u00a0recently benefited from the insatiable demand\u00a0of\u00a0artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and FCF an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While much\u00a0of the focus is on Nvidia\u2019s market\u00a0cap\u00a0reaching\u00a0$2.3T, up 230% over the last year, the\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0valuation\u00a0has\u00a0actually come\u00a0down over that period. As of 3/31/23, consensus was valuing the company at 61x forward EPS. This compares\u00a0to today, where the company is\u00a0being valued\u00a0at 37x. While yes, we have never seen a company expand their market cap by so much so quickly, we have also never seen a company grow their fundamental earnings and cash generation so quickly (and which is\u00a0actually expanding\u00a0faster than valuation).\u00a0While competitors are working to enter the GPU space,\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0has\u00a0created a moat around their GPUs with their CUDA software offering. While we do expect the large cloud players to continue to move into the market, we think NVDA can continue to demand top market share.

        "Title": "Missed the Nvidia Train? 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) juggernaut is showing no signs of stopping as the semiconductor behemoth delivered another set of stunning results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (for the three months ended April 28) on May 22 that easily crushed Wall Street's expectations.\nWhile Nvidia's revenue jumped a whopping 262% year over year to $26 billion, its non-GAAP earnings shot up 461% to $6.12 per share. Analysts would have settled for $5.60 per share in earnings on revenue of $24.6 billion. What's more, Nvidia has guided for fiscal second-quarter revenue of $28 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be more than double the $13.5 billion revenue it posted in the prior-year period and well above the $26.6 billion consensus estimate.\nThere were more goodies in store for Nvidia investors as the company increased its quarterly-cash dividend by 150% and also pointed out that it will start shipping its next-generation Blackwell chips ahead of schedule. All this indicates that Nvidia's red-hot stock market rally is here to stay. The stock has jumped 115% in 2024 already, and its latest results and guidance point toward more gains.\nBut if you're one of those investors who have missed the Nvidia gravy train and are wary of buying the stock now because of its expensive valuation -- even though it may be able to justify it -- it would be a good idea to take a closer look at Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW). Let's look at the reasons why.\nNvidia's phenomenal results gave server manufacturer Super Micro Computer a nice boost. That wasn't surprising as the robust demand for Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI)-focused chips bodes well for Super Micro, whose server solutions are used for mounting those chips in data centers.\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that the demand for its current and next-generation chips could exceed supply going into 2025. That's good news for Super Micro as it should continue to see healthy demand for its AI-optimized servers and sustain the terrific growth it has been clocking in recent quarters.\nSMCI Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\nSuper Micro's revenue forecast of $14.9 billion for the current fiscal year would translate into a 110% increase from the previous year's reading of $7.1 billion. Similarly, its earnings expectation of $23.69 per share for fiscal 2024 would be double last year's level of $11.81 per share. However, it won't be surprising to see Super Micro growing at a faster pace than it is currently forecasting.\nThat's because the company has already revealed server solutions for Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which will start shipping in the current quarter and ramp up as the year progresses. Reports suggest that Super Micro has already received huge orders for servers optimized for mounting Blackwell processors, and it could be expected to fulfill a quarter of the demand for servers built using Nvidia's next-gen chips.\nNot surprisingly, Super Micro's top and bottom lines are expected to grow substantially over the next couple of fiscal years.\nSMCI Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\nSuper Micro's revenue is expected to quadruple in just three years (given that it delivered $7.1 billion in revenue in the previous fiscal year), while earnings could jump 3.5 times by fiscal 2026 from fiscal 2023's reading of $11.81 per share. More importantly, it isn't too late for investors to buy this AI stock as it is trading at an attractive 4.4 times sales and 25 times forward earnings.\nNvidia, on the other hand, has a sales multiple of 33 along with a forward-earnings multiple of 43. Even better, analysts are expecting Super Micro's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 62% for the next five years, giving investors yet another solid reason to accumulate this stock before it flies higher.\nSnowflake may not be as popular an AI name as the other two companies discussed in this article. But the company, which provides a cloud-based platform that helps organizations to store, organize, analyze, and build applications using their proprietary data, believes that AI could become its next big growth driver.\nSnowflake stock is down over 21% in 2024 thanks to poor guidance and management transition announced in February. However, the company's first-quarter fiscal 2025 results (for the three months ended April 30) suggest that AI could play an important role in driving future growth.\nThe company's top line increased 33% year over year to $829 million, easily exceeding the $787 million consensus estimate. More importantly, the company's fiscal Q2 product-revenue forecast of $805 million to $810 million was ahead of the $793 million estimate and points toward a year-over-year increase of 26.5% at the midpoint. The company has also raised its full-year product-revenue guidance to $3.3 billion from $3.25 billion.\nSnowflake's remaining performance obligations, a metric that refers to the total value of a company's contracts that are yet to be fulfilled, increased 46% year over year to $5 billion. That was faster than the growth in its top line, indicating that the company is building a solid revenue pipeline for the future.\nIt seems that AI is playing a central role in boosting Snowflake's growth prospects. CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy pointed out in the company's press release: \"Our AI products, now generally available, are generating strong customer interest. They will help our customers deliver effective and efficient AI-powered experiences faster than ever.\"\nIt is worth noting that Snowflake has been investing aggressively in AI infrastructure and has been looking to quickly deploy AI-focused products to help its customers make the most of their data. The company has also teamed up with Nvidia to help its customers deploy custom AI models for various tasks, such as translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, extracting content from documents, and creating generative AI-powered assistants.\nAdditionally, Snowflake is looking to shore up its AI capabilities by acquiring TruEra, an observability platform that will allow enterprises to monitor and evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) and machine learning models. Such moves should allow Snowflake to set itself up for stronger long-term growth as high-quality data is important for the development of robust, generative AI applications.\nAs such, it won't be surprising to see Snowflake stock gaining momentum as its AI-focused moves start paying off. The stock is currently trading at 17 times sales. Though that's expensive, the sales multiple is lower than last year's reading of 24 and significantly cheaper than Nvidia. However, it may become more expensive in the future thanks to Snowflake's growing AI chops, which is why it would be a good idea to buy it before it soars higher.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "As you might know, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) just kicked off its latest quarterly results with some very strong numbers. NVIDIA beat earnings, with revenues hitting US$26b, ahead of expectations, and statutory earnings per share outperforming analyst reckonings by a solid 15%. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.\n Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nTaking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from NVIDIA's 53 analysts is for revenues of US$120.5b in 2025. This reflects a substantial 51% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to shoot up 48% to US$25.57. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$112.8b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$23.21 in 2025. So it seems there's been a definite increase in optimism about NVIDIA's future following the latest results, with a nice increase in the earnings per share forecasts in particular.\nWith these upgrades, we're not surprised to see that the analysts have lifted their price target 14% to US$1,166per share. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on NVIDIA, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$1,400 and the most bearish at US$754 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await NVIDIA shareholders.\nAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. The analysts are definitely expecting NVIDIA's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 73% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 37% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 17% per year. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect NVIDIA to grow faster than the wider industry.\nThe biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around NVIDIA's earnings potential next year. Pleasantly, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and their forecasts suggest the business is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on NVIDIA. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Dell Technologies Inc. shares have been acting like market-leader Nvidia Corp. of late, and investors are betting the company will see a similar boost from artificial intelligence.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nModi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority\nShort Sellers in Danger of Extinction After Crushing Stock Gains\nBonds Climb as Data Put November Fed Cut in Play: Markets Wrap\nMnuchin Chases Wall Street Glory With His War Chest of Foreign Money\nIntel CEO Takes Aim at Nvidia in Fight for AI Chip Dominance\nThe maker of personal computers and servers has emerged as one of the biggest winners of the AI boom, and this narrative is likely to be reinforced when it reports its first-quarter results after the close. Confirmation of improving growth prospects could continue to support a stock that\u2019s at a record high while trading at a discount to other tech favorites.\nDell recently generated excitement by unveiling a line of PCs optimized for AI, adding to hopes that such features could prompt a long-awaited upgrade cycle from customers and businesses. HP Inc. on Wednesday reported the first increase in PC sales in two years.\nAt the same time, its high-powered servers have been endorsed by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who praised his company\u2019s \u201cgreat partnership\u201d with Dell at its GTC conference and said that \u201cnobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.\u201d\nThe firm \u201chas become a really important part of the AI ecosystem, and it still hasn\u2019t gotten enough credit for that,\u201d said Doug Clinton, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management.\n\u201cBoth the PC and the server businesses will drive growth in coming years, and that\u2019s supportive of both the stock and the multiple. We really see it as both a growth and a value play, since the growth story is still under-appreciated and the multiple is very low relative to other AI plays.\u201d\nShares have climbed 127% this year, and are coming off a six-day rally, their longest streak since July. The stock fell 3% on Thursday. Much of this year\u2019s gain has come in the wake of Dell\u2019s previous report, which showed AI fueling massive demand for its servers.\nOne reason Dell may be somewhat off the radar of investors is that, even though it has a market capitalization in excess of $127 billion \u2014 making it larger than the vast majority of S&P 500 components \u2014 it isn\u2019t a member of the large-cap equity index. It had previously not been eligible given its multiple share classes, but S&P Dow Jones Indices scrapped a rule preventing such companies from inclusion last year.\nAnalysts expect Dell to be added, and view its inclusion as a potential catalyst for the stock. Super Micro Computer Inc., another play on AI servers, was added in March, despite having a market cap below $50 billion.\nThe S&P 500 is rebalanced quarterly, with the next scheduled to occur in June. Becoming a component would open Dell up to a new universe of investors who use the S&P 500 as their benchmark, as well as flows into passive funds that track the index.\n\u201cDell remains an under-owned and underweighted stock and with the potential catalysts of AI and potential inclusion in the S&P,\u201d Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a May 29 report in which he raised his price target, citing the beneficial impact from AI servers, high-end storage and PCs.\nBofA\u2019s higher target is a reflection of how analysts are bullish on the stock. More than 80% of the firms tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the shares, and Morgan Stanley has it as a top pick, calling it the best stock to play server momentum, inflecting storage demand, and an improving PC market.\nRead more: Dell\u2019s Sales Seen Recovering on AI Servers: Preview\nThat growing optimism has prevented the multiple from getting into nosebleed territory. The consensus for the company\u2019s net 2025 earnings has risen by 7.6% over the past month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while the revenue consensus is up 1.3% over that period.\nShares trade at 22 times estimated earnings, a notable discount to the Nasdaq 100 Index, and cheaper than other AI plays, including Nvidia, Super Micro, and Microsoft Corp. However, Dell\u2019s multiple is a record for the stock, and well above its five-year average of 5.8.\n\u201cDell is becoming an increasingly strategic vendor in AI, but there\u2019s a lot more appreciation for this than there was a few months ago,\u201d said Dan Flax, senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman. \u201cDemand for AI systems remains healthy, but other parts of the business remain cyclical, and if we see a macro downturn, even a growth story as powerful as AI could slow down.\u201d\nTech Chart of the Day\nSalesforce Inc. shares fell as much as 19% on Thursday, a drop that would represent its biggest one-day percentage decline in more than 15 years. The selloff came after the cloud-based software firm said sales growth in the current quarter will stall to its slowest in history.\nTop Tech Stories\nTesla Inc. is a company in disarray. Layoffs are mounting. Morale is shattered. Its stock is cratering and sales are anemic. And, some investors say, it\u2019s got a distracted leader at the helm.\nHP Inc. reported quarterly revenue that topped analysts\u2019 estimates, including the first increase in PC sales in two years, an optimistic signal for a long-awaited rebound in the market.\nApple Inc. is seeking a senior engineer to help build a television and sports app for Android, a sign the company is finally bringing its TV+ service to the rival smartphone platform.\nGenerative artificial intelligence is only just starting to make its economic impact felt, OpenAI Inc. Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati said.\nAmazon.com Inc. is increasing its stake in Grubhub to as much as 18% and expanding its partnership with the food delivery service to allow US users to order takeout directly on Amazon\u2019s website and shopping app.\nEarnings Due Thursday\nPostmarket\nDell Technologies\nMarvell Technology\nZscaler\nMongoDB\nNetApp Inc\nElastic\nHashiCorp\nSentinelOne\nAsana\nAmbarella\nPagerDuty Inc\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n(Updates to market open.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Budget Geeks Who Helped Solve an American Economic Puzzle\nStartup Brings New Hope to the Pursuit of Reviving Frozen Bodies\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year\nDisney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track\nHow Rage, Boredom and WallStreetBets Created a New Generation of Young American Traders\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Brian's Big Idea on Nvidia (NVDA), Should You Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Brian Bolan ",
        "Text": "Brian Bolan is the aggressive growth stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research and he has a big idea for people that are wondering if they should buy Nvidia NVDA after the most recent earnings report.\nBrian takes a look at the stock following an earnings beat which is the 6th consecutive beat for the stock. Brian mentions that there are dozens of analysts that cover this name at brokerages so the consensus is a fairly deep number. Despite all of that coverage the company continues to outperform expectations.\nThe company reported earnings per share of $6.12 when the Zacks consensus estimate stood at $5.49. That beat of $0.63 works out to be a positive earnings surprise of 11.5%. Over the last four quarters the average positive earnings surprise has worked out to be 18.4%.\nSales came in at $26B when the expectation was calling for $24.3B. The company then guided next quarter revenue to a range of between $27.4B to $28.6B when the consensus was sitting at $26.2B. When a company guides revenue higher than expectations the stock often moves higher.\nValuation\nNVDA trades at a 38x forward earnings multiple, which is a lot but not at the nifty 50 level that a lot of investors are used to seeing for companies that post year over year growth of more than 100% and are expected to show continued growth of 100% in the next quarter. The price to book multiple comes in at 55x and while that may scare off some value investors the idea here is that there is still a lot of growth before this can become a value stock. The price to sales multiple of 29x also feels like a lofty number but again the growth is really there.\nStock Split\nOn the earnings call the company announced a 10 for 1 stock split. This means that the price of NVIDIA stock will seem to drop dramatically on June 10th, but at the same time you will now have 10 shares for everyone that you own. Brian discusses how retail investors have a hard time stomaching very large point moves even when the stock is trading at $900 or $1000 or $1100.\nAlong with the stock split the company announced a 150% increase to its dividend.\nZacks Portfolio Managers Love NVDA\nThere are at least three portfolios run by David Bartosiak, Kevin Cook and Andrew Rocco that all have NVDA in them.\nNot surprisingly, NVDA is the top performer for all three of those portfolios.\nBlockchain Innovators is run by \u201cBuy and Hold\u201d David Bartosiak and he added shares of NVDA back in April of 2019 at $43 and change. He is sitting on a gain of more than 2300% in that position.\nKevin Cook might be our biggest NVDA bull as he bought shares back in October of 2022 at $125 and is showing a gain of 744% on those shares. Kevin runs the TAZR service which stands for Technical Analysis and Zacks Rank. He also added shares of NVDL, which is a 2x leveraged ETF on NVDA about a month ago and has a 73% return on that position as well.\nFinally we have our Tech Innovators service that is managed by Andrew Rocco and he is a little more active of a trader. He added shares to the service on April 29 of 2024 at $875 and is already up 20.5% in just a month on that position.\nShould You Buy NVDA\nThe big question that investors have is should they be buying NVDA right now. The answer, according to Brian Bolan is yes. The company Noted in the release that they are preparing for their next wave of growth. The AI build out continues and now the company is looking at accelerated computing as another growth driver. When a company posts higher than expected revenues and increased margins there is growth in earnings per share. When earnings per share grows and there still looks to be continued momentum on the top line share prices often move higher.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock's Next Big Catalysts Could Come on May 22. Should You Buy Shares Before Then?",
        "Author": "  Beth McKenna, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is having another great year. In 2024, shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) tech giant have gained 91.9% through May 15, crushing the S&P 500 index's 11.9% return. The stock's longer-term performance is even more stunning, as it turned an investment of $5,000 into nearly $1 million over the last decade through April 29.\nA catalyst that might propel Nvidia stock higher is coming on Wednesday, May 22, after the market close. That's when the company is scheduled to release its results for its quarter ended on April 28.\nGiven Nvidia stock's fantastic recent performance, expectations are high and built into the stock price. For the stock to rise after the report, the company will likely have to at least comfortably beat Wall Street's estimates for the quarter and issue guidance for the next quarter that's notably higher than analysts are projecting.\nYou can use the below chart to gauge Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter results.\nMetric\nFiscal Q1 2024 Result\nNvidia's Fiscal Q1 2025 Guidance\nNvidia's Projected Change\nWall Street's Fiscal Q1 2025 Consensus Estimate\nWall Street's Projected Change\nRevenue\n$7.19 billion\n$24 billion\n234%\n$24.57 billion\n242%\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS)\n$1.09\n$5.41*\n396%\n$5.57\n411%\nData sources: Nvidia and Yahoo! Finance. Fiscal Q1 2025 ended April 28, 2024. *Calculated by the author based on the metrics for which management provides guidance. Data as of May 15, 2024.\nThe below chart can be used to gauge Nvidia's guidance for its fiscal second quarter.\nMetric\nFiscal Q2 2024 Result\nWall Street's Fiscal Q2 2025 Consensus Estimate\nWall Street's Projected Change\nRevenue\n$13.51 billion\n$26.57 billion\n97%\nAdjusted EPS\n$2.70\n$5.92\n119%\nData sources: Nvidia and Yahoo! Finance. Fiscal Q2 2025 ends in late July 2024. Data as of May 15, 2024.\nThe first reason Nvidia looks poised to beat Wall Street's estimates has to do with management \"visibility.\" Nvidia's top management team has said on the company's recent quarterly analyst earnings calls that it has good visibility into near-term sales in its data center business. That's because the company has a backlog of orders to fulfill due to demand being so strong for its AI-enabling data center chips and related products.\nManagement probably has less of a handle on near-term demand for products in some of its other businesses. But that doesn't matter much because data center is by far Nvidia's largest market platform, and so it drives overall results.\nThe better management's visibility into near-term sales, the better idea it has of its near-term financial results. You can be sure Nvidia's savvy top management team set fiscal Q1 guidance at levels it feels very confident the company will exceed. Wall Street analysts use Nvidia's guidance to help establish their estimates. For many years analysts have underestimated the company's growth potential, and my bet is this dynamic will continue.\nThe second reason that Nvidia's upcoming report -- including from a fiscal Q2 guidance standpoint -- seems poised to be better than analysts expect stems from the recent quarterly reports of several of Nvidia's biggest customers. Companies such as Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Microsoft are continuing to ramp up their already significant spending on AI initiatives, which is a positive for Nvidia.\nFor instance, Meta now expects its full-year 2024 capital expenditures to range from $35 million to $40 million, up from its prior plan of $30 million to $37 billion. This is due to the company continuing to \"accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap,\" CFO Susan Li said on the Q1 earnings call.\nOf course, there are no guarantees, but I think it's more likely than not that Nvidia stock will rise after the upcoming earnings release for the reasons just outlined. And there's another possible catalyst: The timing seems good for the company to announce a stock split.\nThat said, if you're a long-term investor, you don't need to concern yourself with trying to time your stock buys. Over the long term, if your bullish thesis is correct for Nvidia, it shouldn't make that much difference if you paid a bit more or less for its stock many years back.\nLet's look at an example. Nvidia stock closed at $946.30 per share on May 15. Exactly five years ago, the stock closed at $39.90, adjusted for stock splits. If you invested $1,000 in Nvidia stock five years ago, your investment would now be worth $23,717. Had you invested in the stock about five years ago and its price per share was, say, 15% higher than $39.90, or $45.89, your investment would now be worth $20,621. I'm guessing you'd be thrilled to have turned your $1,000 into nearly $21,000 in five years, and not kicking yourself for not doing a little better.\nA smart way to build your position in any stock is to invest the same dollar amount at regular intervals, such as monthly or quarterly. This method eliminates the potential that you'll invest your entire amount at what turns out to be a near-term peak for the stock price.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in recent months, and that's not surprising, as the company has played a critical role in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nCompanies in the race to develop and deploy AI applications have been turning to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to utilize the parallel computational power of its chips so that they can train large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. As it turns out, the demand for Nvidia's GPUs has been so strong that the company has been finding it difficult to meet the end-market demand, leading to long waiting periods.\nThe good news is that Nvidia has been boosting its production capacity, and that explains why it is expected to deliver another year of solid growth in fiscal 2025 (which has just begun). Its top line is expected to grow nearly 84% this fiscal year to $112 billion, while the bottom line is expected to jump 91% to $24.87 per share. All this explains why investors have been piling into Nvidia stock, which has already gained more than 82% in 2024.\nNvidia looks well placed to justify its expensive trailing earnings multiple of 75, considering the potential growth it could deliver. The sharp increase in its earnings going forward is evident from a much lower forward price-to-earnings ratio of 37. However, investors who have missed Nvidia's terrific run-up and are wary of paying a rich earnings multiple can consider taking a closer look at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).\nJust like Nvidia, Microsoft is also a key player in the AI market, and it can be bought at a reasonable valuation right now. Here's why savvy investors should consider doing that right away.\nShares of Microsoft have gained only 10% so far this year. This explains why the stock can still be bought at a relatively reasonable earnings multiple of about 35, which is much lower than Nvidia's multiple. Microsoft's forward earnings multiple of 31 also represents a discount to that of Nvidia.\nOf course, Microsoft isn't growing as rapidly as Nvidia, but it has been consistently beating Wall Street's earnings expectations in recent quarters, and its growth has been accelerating.\nFor instance, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 31), Microsoft's revenue increased 17% year over year to $61.9 billion. That was a nice acceleration over the 7% revenue growth the company clocked in the same period last year.\nAdditionally, Microsoft's earnings growth also improved to 20% year over year in the previous quarter, from 10% in the year-ago period. AI is playing a key role in this acceleration, as Microsoft management noted on the latest earnings conference call. CEO Satya Nadella remarked that the company's Azure cloud platform \"took share as customers use our platforms and tools to build their own AI solutions.\"\nMore specifically, AI drove 7 percentage points worth of growth for Microsoft's Azure cloud business last quarter out of the segment's year-over-year growth of 31%. The growth could have been stronger had Microsoft been able to meet all the AI-related demand for cloud services, but the company said that demand has been higher than supply.\nThis explains why Microsoft has been ramping up its spending on cloud AI infrastructure across the globe in countries such as Japan, France, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the U.S. Even better, recent reports indicate that the tech giant could spend $100 billion on building a generative AI supercomputer through 2028. As such, Microsoft is setting itself up to make the most of the booming demand for cloud AI services in the long run.\nAccording to a third-party estimate, the cloud AI market was worth an estimated $43 billion in 2022. The market is expected to post 36% annual growth through 2032 and generate a whopping $887 billion in annual revenue. Microsoft has generated just over $100 billion in revenue from its Intelligent Cloud division business in the past year, and the incremental growth opportunity in the cloud AI market indicates that it has a lot of room to grow in this space.\nThrow in the potential AI-related gains that Microsoft could achieve in the AI-enabled personal computer and workplace productivity markets, and it won't be surprising to see the company's growth accelerating further in the long run.\nAnalysts are expecting Microsoft's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 16% over the next five years, which would be a slowdown compared to its 20% annual earnings growth in the past five years. However, observers have already seen that Microsoft's bottom-line growth is accelerating thanks to AI. So, it won't be surprising to see the company's earnings growing at a faster pace in the future.\nAssuming Microsoft manages to get an annual earnings growth rate of 25% over the next five years, its earnings could hit $29.93 per share in fiscal 2028 (using fiscal 2023 earnings of $9.81 per share as the base). Multiplying the projected earnings with Microsoft's five-year forward earnings of 29 points toward a stock price of $868 after five years -- a jump of 110% from current levels.\nBut if the market decides to reward Microsoft with a higher valuation or the company delivers stronger earnings growth, this AI stock could deliver much stronger gains. That's why investors who missed the Nvidia train should consider jumping onto Microsoft stock before it steps on the gas.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock: Cheaper than it Was a Year Ago",
        "Author": "  Ethan Feller ",
        "Text": "Nvidia\u00a0NVDA\u00a0reported earnings this week and posted another quarter of stunning growth, beating analysts\u2019 estimates on both the top and bottom line and announcing a ten-for-one stock split.\nNvidia continues to completely dominate the AI infrastructure industry, providing all the major technology businesses of the world with the GPUs and data center products required to run the extremely demanding models.\nThe word \u201cdominating\u201d almost doesn\u2019t capture the influence this company is having on the industry, and its outrageous growth rates are truly something to behold.\nQuarterly revenue of $26 billion was up 18% from the prior quarter and 262% YoY, while Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion was up 23% on the quarter and 427% on the year.\nNet income for the quarter was $14.8 billion and is up 628% YoY. To put that growth into perspective, Nvidia\u2019s total annual revenue in 2021 was $16 billion, which is now about how much profit they make in just a quarter!\n\u00a0\nSometimes in the market we see growth stocks with great stories, and huge growth projections go on incredible runs in a short period, only to fall back to earth when the growth doesn\u2019t materialize. That is not what\u2019s happening at Nvidia.\nGrowth at Nvidia has already been realized with sales and earnings having already climbed many multiples over just the last year, and with more to come.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs of right now sales for this year are expected to increase 77.6% to $108 billion, but next year\u2019s sales growth is still fairly tepid, with forecasts of 20.5%. While this year\u2019s estimates are lofty, analysts remain grounded as they look further out.\nWith just 20% growth projected for next year, we could even see more upside surprises.\nWhen looking at relative valuations, Nvidia is actually cheaper than it was a year ago. At the beginning of 2023, NVDA was trading at a forward earnings multiple of about 90x, while today it is trading at 45.3x FY24 earnings estimates and just 36x FY25 earnings estimates.\nI think investors can still safely invest in Nvidia stock based on its reasonable valuation, and future expected growth.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile yes, Nvidia\u2019s stock has appreciated nearly 4x over the last year, earnings have outpaced that growth! Earnings are up nearly 6x in that time, and margins have expanded from 18.5% to 54.3%.\nWith those growth rates, and improved business fundamentals, you could argue that Nvidia deserves and even richer earnings multiple.\u00a0\nI don\u2019t know about other research publications, but at Zacks we have been all over Nvidia this last year. In the chart below we can see that earnings estimates began to rise in Q2 2023, and at that time it jumped onto the Zacks Rank.\nIt has enjoyed a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating for nearly that entire time, besides for occasional periods of dropping down to a Rank #2, when analysts took breaks from upgrading it.\nA number of contributors here have been pounding the table about buying Nvidia stock, and if you look back, I have published a number of bullish writeups over the last year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEven with the reasons shared here, many investors will still resist buying Nvidia stock, and I do understand the psychological difficulties with buying a stock that has rallied so much already. So, for those investors I will share my other top picks to ride the AI wave.\nAlphabet\u00a0GOOGL\u00a0has quickly jumped near the front of the AI expansion. At its most recent developer conference, Alphabet shared a number of exciting new AI integration to its suite of products.\nAI Agents, they call them, will act as an assistant across Gmail, Search, and Android devices.\nAlphabet also boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, as well as a historically discounted valuation. Trading at 22.8x forward earnings, it is below its 10-year median of 26.2x.\nAdditionally, Alphabet stock has been showing considerable relative strength against most of the other mega-cap technology stocks, outperforming all the Magnificent Seven excluding Nvidia in the last three months.\nImage Source: TradingView\nAnother AI beneficiary with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating is Arista Networks\u00a0ANET.\nLess well known than most of its AI counterparts, Arista Networks specializes in high-performance, software-driven network switches and routers for data centers, cloud computing, and large-scale enterprise environments.\nArista Networks plays a crucial role in the AI boom by providing the advanced networking infrastructure required for AI workloads. Its high-speed, low-latency switches and routers facilitate the efficient data flow and massive computational power needed for AI and machine learning applications.\nNot everyone has missed this quiet AI-winner though, as analysts have been steadily raising earning estimates over the last year, and the stock has rallied nearly 100% over the last year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nIn just the last two days I have had a number of people reaching out and asking, \u201cis it too late to buy Nvidia?\u201d And my answer is no, it probably isn\u2019t too late.\nOf course, it would have been better to buy it last year when it was trading $200, but even at $1,045 per share there is still upside. However, with a market cap of $2.5 trillion now, the upside is unlikely to be as pronounced as when it was much smaller.\nFortunately for investors, there are additional stocks to get involved in for exposure to the AI boom, and this new technology will likely lead markets for the foreseeable future.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to report its fiscal first-quarter 2025 earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, May 22.\nInvestors will be mainly focusing on growth trends in Nvidia\u2019s data center segment and any updates on the recently announced Blackwell platform.\nWall Street analysts project Nvidia's revenue to reach $24.65 billion for Q1 FY2025, up from the previous quarter and more than tripling from the year-ago period, according to consensus estimates by Visible Alpha.\nNet income is expected to soar to $12.87 billion, notably higher than the $2.04 billion profit recorded a year ago and up from the final quarter of FY2024. On a per-share basis, diluted earnings are anticipated to be $5.17, a sharp increase from 82 cents in the year-ago period.\nHowever, a key focus in Nvidia's upcoming earnings report will be its data center segment. Nvidia has positioned itself as an early beneficiary of the AI boom, leading to rapid growth in this division. The unprecedented demand for Nvidia's advanced computing chips, which are specialized for running AI workloads, has significantly driven this expansion.\nCiti analysts project Nvidia's April quarter total and data center sales to be $24 billion and $21 billion, respectively, in line with expectations. They believe buy-side estimates are higher at approximately $26 billion for total sales and $23 billion for data center sales.\nFor the July quarter, Citi models total sales of $27.5 billion, compared to the Street's estimate of $26.5 billion and buy-side expectations of around $28 billion.\n\u201cWe expect smaller beats vs the prior few quarters on larger numbers, shorter H100 lead times, and gross margin normalization before GB200 volume ramps in 1H25,\u201d analysts at the Wall Street giant said in a note.\n\u201cGoing into earnings, we believe investors are focused on a) GB200 ramp/pipeline, b) potential air pocket in AI demand in 2H24, c) B200\u2019s impact on LT gross margins, d) power constraints on AI data center rollouts, and e) sovereign AI&China H20 demand,\u201d they added.\nMeanwhile, in their pre-earnings report, Piper Sandler analysts said they continue to see strong demand for Nvidia\u2019s data center products and believe the company is poised for another \u201cbeat-and-raise quarter.\u201d\n\u201cDemand for Hopper GPUs remains strong with supply still working to catch up to demand as the product is still on allocation. Our checks indicate that demand for the Blackwell GPU series is also set to be strong across NVDA\u2019s data center customer base,\u201d they noted.\nIn terms of results, Piper Sandler's bull case suggests that Nvidia's total revenues could surpass current expectations by $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion for April, with a similar beat anticipated for July. Should that happen, the investment firm expects Nvidia stock to be flat or slightly up after the print\u2019s release due to high investor expectations.\nRelated Articles\nNvidia earnings preview: Here's what Citi, Piper Sandler analysts expect to see\nDaimler Truck and Volvo intend to form software joint venture\nExclusive-Musk pushes plan for China data to power Tesla's AI ambitions\n"

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com-- Nvidia has been pushed into selling artificial intelligence chips in China at heavy discounts due to stiff competition from local players, specifically Huawei, Reuters reported on Friday.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) had launched three AI chips tailor made for China last year, amid U.S. sanctions that prevented the firm from selling its most advanced AI chips in the country.\nAmong the three, the H20, which is the most powerful, was seeing subdued demand in China, and in some cases, was being sold at an over 10% discount to a similar offering from Huawei- the Ascend 910B, the Reuters report said.\nThe Ascend 910B was also seeing substantially more orders than the H20 from state-backed enterprises, Reuters said, citing limited government data. This came following a mandate from Beijing for state enterprises to use China-made silicon.\nThe 910B is the most advanced Chinese AI chip, and has shot up in popularity in the country following U.S. sanctions that attempted to block China\u2019s access to the latest AI advancements.\nIts popularity in China presents more headwinds for Nvidia\u2019s business in the country. The chipmaker has struggled to maintain its foothold in Chinese markets following the U.S. sanctions.\nDuring its first quarter earnings this week, the company warned that China was becoming an increasingly competitive market, and that the firm\u2019s data center revenue in China fell \u201csignificantly.\u201d\nSteep discounts on the H20 also present more margin pressure for Nvidia.\nRelated Articles\nNvidia cuts China AI chip prices amid competition from Huawei- Reuters\nExclusive-Nvidia cuts China prices in Huawei chip fight, sources say\nExclusive-Samsung's HBM chips failing Nvidia tests due to heat and power consumption woes, sources say\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Nvidia (NVDA), which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 16.52%.\nFor the most recent quarter, Nvidia was expected to post earnings of $4.55 per share, but it reported $5.16 per share instead, representing a surprise of 13.41%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $3.36 per share, while it actually produced $4.02 per share, a surprise of 19.64%.\nPrice and EPS Surprise\nFor Nvidia, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nNvidia currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.50%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on May 22, 2024.\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Jamie McGeever ",
        "Text": "By Jamie McGeever\n(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\nMonetary policy decisions from New Zealand and Indonesia are the main points of focus in Asia on Wednesday, as debate over the timing of the first U.S. rate cut ebbs and flows, and lofty equity markets consider their next step.\nAsian stocks retreated on Tuesday, snapping a seven-day winning streak despite the relative calm in currency and bond markets. But Wall Street crept higher, with the Nasdaq reaching a new peak ahead of Nvidia's first-quarter earnings report.\nThe message on interest rates from a raft of Federal Reserve officials on Tuesday was patience. Indeed, it may be several months before policymakers are confident inflation is really falling back to target, allowing them to start cutting rates.\nWith many stock markets around the world at record or multi-year highs, a period of cooling may be inevitable. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index on Tuesday slipped 0.9% - its biggest fall in over a month - while Japan's Nikkei lost 0.3%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed more than 2%.\nAfter Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson rowed back on his long-standing gloomy outlook for Wall Street on Monday, another prominent bear, JP Morgan's Marko Kolanovic, reiterated his view that U.S. stocks are too expensive and should head south.\nHe is much more upbeat on Asia, favoring Japanese and Chinese equities over U.S. markets. Japan is attractive because of inflation and monetary policy normalization, while measures to support the housing market, underweight investor positioning and cheap valuations are reasons to buy China.\nWhile the world maintains its vigil ahead of AI darling Nvidia's results on Wednesday, investors in Asia digest two monetary policy decisions and other potentially exchange rate-moving data, including Japanese trade and South Korean producer price inflation.\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand and Bank Indonesia are both expected to leave their key interest rates on hold, at 5.50% and 6.25%, respectively, according to Reuters polls.\nThe RBNZ is only expected to cut its cash rate once this year, and probably not until the final quarter. Money markets are a bit more dovish, and are currently pricing in 45 basis points of easing by year-end.\nAfter stunning markets last month with an unexpected rate hike to support the rupiah, Bank Indonesia (BI) is expected to keep its seven-day reverse repurchase rate at 6.25% and hold it there for several months, or until the Fed cuts U.S. rates.\nIn a rare media briefing earlier this month, BI Governor Perry Warjiyo said current data shows there is no need to raise rates again, and the central bank is trying to strengthen the rupiah beyond 16,000 per dollar.\nThe rupiah closed trading on Tuesday at 15,990 per dollar.\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Wednesday:\n- New Zealand monetary policy decision\n- Indonesia monetary policy decision\n- Japan trade (April)\n(Reporting by Jamie McGeever; Editing by Bill Berkrot)\n"

        "Text": "Investors exhaled last week after the government reported that U.S. inflation was better-than-feared in April.\nBut while stocks are back at record highs, investors are likely a little bit nervous ahead of arguably the most important earnings report of the first quarter\u2014Nvidia\u2019s.\nThe A.I. chipmaker is scheduled to release first-quarter results on Wednesday after the markets close. With the stock up 91% since the start of the year, expectations are a bit high.\nAny surprises in Nvidia\u2019s report will effect the stock and the 501 U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds that hold it.\nAnalysts expect that Nvidia will report earnings per share of $5.65 and revenues of $24.68 billion for Q1.\nMatching those numbers may not satisfy Nvidia bulls. In the fourth quarter, Nvidia topped revenue estimates by 8%, while it beat by 13% in the quarter before that.\nAccording to Susquehanna analyst Chris Rolland, the company will need to top the Q1 consensus sales estimate by $1.5 billion, or 6%, to keep the stock flat after earnings.\nThat \u201cwhisper number\u201d is notably higher than the analyst consensus, but the 6% margin is one that Nvidia has managed to beat in each of the past four quarters.\nHow shares of Nvidia react to the company\u2019s earnings report may have a major impact on the many ETFs that hold them.\nPerhaps no fund is as sensitive to the company's performance as the GraniteShares 1.5x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL), which aims to give investors one-and-a-half times the return as Nvidia's publicly-traded shares. That fund has jumped more than five-fold over the past year as Nvidia tripled in price.\nSemiconductor exchange-traded funds in particular, like the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)\u2014which hold 21% and 9% of their portfolios, respectively, in the stock, will be greatly affected. \nArtificial intelligence ETFs, such as the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (CHAT), which holds an 11% position in the stock, will also feel the stock\u2019s gyrations.\nEven broad market investors may not be able to escape the pull of Nvidia\u2019s stock on Thursday, the day following the earnings release. \nNvidia currently has a 5.1% weighting in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), making it the third-largest holding for the ETF.\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "Author": "  Dylan Sloan ",
        "Text": "Markets breathed a sigh of relief after Nvidia\u2019s long-anticipated earnings report comfortably beat expectations, with revenue up an eye-watering 262% from last year, sending its share price to an all-time high of $1,017 after market close. Driven by massive AI demand, the chipmaker also announced a 10-to-1 stock split, which will make shares more accessible for retail investors and could boost share prices even more.\n\u201cThe industry is going through a major change,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call Wednesday. \u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun. Companies and countries are partnering with Nvidia to shift the trillion-dollar installed base of data centers to accelerate computing and build a new type of data center, AI factories, to produce a new commodity, artificial intelligence.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s stock has been on a tear over the past year: It\u2019s up 200% in the past 12 months, and up 87% since the beginning of 2024. Its explosive growth has catapulted it to the third-highest market capitalization in the world, above peers including Amazon and Meta. \u201cThe most important stock on planet Earth,\u201d per Goldman Sachs, has helped lift the entire S&P 500 to all-time highs, and another earnings beat is a positive indicator that Nvidia doesn\u2019t intend to slow down anytime soon.\nDemand for Nvidia\u2019s electric circuits, known as graphics processing units (GPUs), and data centers has been \u201cincredible,\u201d said Huang. The phenomenon is largely due to applications like ChatGPT and GPT-4, in addition to the burgeoning class of AI startups, which Huang estimated to include between 15,000 to 20,000 firms. And that doesn\u2019t account for companies focused on self-driving cars, digital character design, and biotech firms, he said, which has led to still greater need from clients.\n\u201cWe\u2019re racing every day,\u201d said Huang. \u201cCustomers are putting a lot of pressure on us to deliver the systems and stand them up as quickly as possible.\u201d\nOver the past year, Nvidia\u2019s had no problem breezing past high expectations: It beat earnings per share estimates by an average of 20% over the prior four quarters before Wednesday\u2019s release. So coming into the earnings report, Wall Street\u2019s expectations were lofty\u2014analysts projected $24.65 billion in revenue. But the $26 billion Nvidia reported was good for a 5.5% beat on Nvidia\u2019s data-center revenue, which makes up the majority of its revenue overall. It came in at $22.6 billion for the quarter, above Wall Street\u2019s $21.13 billion estimate and 427% higher than this time last year. Nvidia\u2019s share price rose as much as 4.4% in aftermarket trading following the earnings release, crossing the $1,000 threshold for the first time during the earnings call.\n\u201cIf 10 was a shockingly good [result] to the upside, I\u2019d give it a seven or eight,\u201d tech investor and The Citadel finance professor Paul Meeks told Fortune.\nAlthough Nvidia\u2019s 10-to-1 stock split doesn\u2019t have any immediate impact on its valuation, making shares cheaper and more accessible for retail investors is a smart move, according to Meeks. Nvidia\u2019s stock is trading at around $950 at the moment, meaning once the stock splits on June 7, investors will likely be able to get their hands on shares for below $100.\n\u201cStock splits are cosmetic \u2026 But as you drive the stock down to about $100 a share, and everyone on planet Earth knows that this is the leading tech stock \u2026 I do think that there are probably some retail investors that are champing at the bit to buy it now,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely overall a positive.\u201d\nThe source of Nvidia\u2019s domination is its massive lead in the AI hardware market. Nvidia pioneered development of GPUs, specialized computer chips it initially used for gaming but then pivoted to market for AI developers as the AI sector has exploded.\nNvidia\u2019s hardware game is backed up by deep investments in software: Its CUDA programming interface, which runs exclusively on its chips, is a must-use for many AI developers, and a key reason why it\u2019s been able to defend its near-monopoly in the AI space.\nNvidia\u2019s rise has been powered by relentless demand: The company\u2019s been forced to pick and choose who gets chips first as everyone from data center operators to startups and Big Tech fights to get their hands on AI computing power, especially its top-of-the-line Blackwell and H200 chips, which the company said it expects to start shipping next quarter.\n\u201cBlackwell is in full production \u2026 Demand for H200 and Blackwell is well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into last year,\u201d Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said in an earnings call.\n\u201cWe will see a lot of Blackwell revenue this year,\u201d Huang added. And, \u201cafter Blackwell, there\u2019s another chip.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s business outside of AI chip development was a relative afterthought. The company\u2019s gaming division, once the core of its business, recorded $2.6 billion in revenue, down 8% from last quarter. Its automotive division recorded gains on $329 million in revenue, but Nvidia\u2019s other business lines paled in comparison to its AI chipmaking investments.\nSince the beginning of this year, though, Nvidia\u2019s rivals have been ratcheting up the competition in the AI hardware space. Intel, flush with $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding, released its Gaudi 3 AI chip last month, which will compete with Nvidia\u2019s top-of-the-line Blackwell model. Big Tech\u2019s AI developers, including Google and Microsoft, have announced they\u2019re designing their own AI chips in-house to reduce their reliance on Nvidia and cut costs.\n\u201cThis combination of some of the big companies saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to develop our own AI chips,\u2019 and other industries saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to do it locally on our smaller devices, for less power consumption\u2019\u2014that might, in the long term, be what hinders their growth,\u201d Edward Wilford, an analyst at tech consultancy Omdia, told Fortune.\nNvidia\u2019s business model isn\u2019t vertically integrated in full: As a chip designer, it creates models for semiconductors but outsources the actual fabrication of its most advanced chips to TSMC, the Taiwanese giant that manufactures over 90% of the world\u2019s advanced chips. Frosty U.S.-China relations and a recent earthquake in Taiwan that briefly shut down TSMC\u2019s headquarters have some Nvidia investors on edge\u2014any significant disruptions to TSMC\u2019s operations would be a big blow to the entire semiconductor supply chain.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be highly aware of how susceptible they are to TSMC and supply disruption. They\u2019ll be watching that carefully,\u201d Wilford said. \u201cThat\u2019s a business that you can\u2019t just relocate from one area to another \u2026 They want to make sure that that\u2019s protected at all costs. That\u2019s going to be something that keeps some people up at night.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

In a subsequent discussion with OSU president Jayathi Murthy, Huang said, \"We're at the beginning of a new industrial revolution.\"\nHe went on to say that during this period, we're \"manufacturing\" artificial intelligence (AI).\nOne company has already kicked its production into high gear. If Huang is right, this company stands to benefit from the AI \"revolution.\"\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) has decades of experience with AI, which enabled the company to quickly develop generative AI tools that businesses can actually use. The result was its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which helps businesses develop AI-powered solutions to real-world problems.\nTo get to the heart of these issues, Palantir hosts boot camps. These consist of \"immersive, hands-on-keyboard sessions [that] allow new and existing customers to build live alongside Palantir engineers, all working toward the common goal of deploying AI in operations.\" This process helps businesses \"go from zero to use case in just one to five days.\" Palantir says there's a \"growing backlog of AIP boot camps due to the overwhelming demand.\"\nBack in October, the company set an internal goal of conducting 500 AIP boot camps in 2024. However, demand was so great it blew through 560 boot camps for 465 organizations in just four months, and the backlog for attendance is growing.\nThe full impact of these boot camps has yet to appear in Palantir's financial results as it continues to ramp up to meet the unprecedented demand. The company's U.S. commercial revenue, its fastest-growing segment, surged 70% year over year, thanks to AIP. Furthermore, the segment is expected to generate \"at least\" 40% growth this year.\nBy some metrics, the valuation might appear steep. However, when measured using the forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in Palantir's accelerating growth -- it sports a multiple of less than 1, suggesting an undervalued stock. That makes Palantir stock a buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

The NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) \"effect\" is now causing many stocks to create buzz in the market, while many analysts believe NVDA shares themselves are overvalued. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nThe AI-led stock rally that rewarded mega-cap technology stocks has finally started to trickle down to other industry players that were seemingly not related to the AI and tech industry. Consider this: The information technology sector gained about 11% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 utilities sector jumped 18% in the same period. Why? Because investors are scrambling to pile into utilities since they are set to benefit from the dramatic rise in power demand thanks to the data center boom caused by the mass AI adaption. As Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang put it in the company's latest earnings call, the \"next industrial revolution\" has started with the dawn of AI and across the globe data centers are being \"converted into AI factories.\"\nA Wall Street Journal report recently quoted Nadia Lovell, senior U.S. equity strategist, global wealth management at UBS, who said that the market is \"no longer dependent on just one stock\" when it comes to AI as she sees a \"broadening out of the AI trade.\"\nInsider Monkey's research backs this notion. Our research recently unlocked several AI stocks that are better than mega-cap AI stocks with soaring valuations. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nFor this article we first conducted thorough research to see which lesser-known companies are offering products and services set to see demand in the AI revolution.

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "All eyes were set on Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) fiscal 2025 first-quarter results (for the three months ended April 28), which were scheduled for release on May 22. And the company didn't disappoint. It handsomely crushed Wall Street's expectations and issued terrific guidance for the current quarter.\nThe health of the artificial intelligence (AI) market was a big reason why investors were waiting with bated breath for Nvidia's results. There have been concerns that Nvidia stock could be in a bubble, and that the company might not be able to sustain its outstanding growth thanks to increasing competition and a pullback in AI infrastructure spending.\nAfter all, Nvidia has been the prime beneficiary of the proliferation of AI as its chips have played a central role in helping train AI models such as ChatGPT and form the backbone of the AI services offered by major tech giants. The semiconductor specialist's results cement the fact that AI is not just hype, which is why its customers are pouring billions of dollars into its hardware.\nDoes this mean investors who have been skeptical about Nvidia's AI-driven future and have missed the stock's red-hot rally should start buying the stock now? Or is it too late for them to buy shares of a company that has soared a stunning 628% since the beginning of 2023?\nNvidia's revenue in fiscal Q1 skyrocketed 262% year over year to $26 billion. Meanwhile, the company's gross margin jumped 12 percentage points year over year to 78.9% thanks to the immense pricing power it enjoys in the AI chip market. As a result, Nvidia's adjusted earnings grew an incredible 461% year over year to $6.12 per share.\nAnalysts were expecting $5.59 per share in earnings from Nvidia on revenue of $24.6 billion. However, another quarter of terrific growth in the company's data center revenue helped it coast past estimates. More specifically, Nvidia's data center revenue shot up a whopping 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 87% of its top line.\nNvidia's management attributed this terrific growth to \"higher shipments of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform used for training and inferencing with large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications.\" What's worth noting is that Nvidia's Hopper platform is set to be succeeded by new chips based on the Blackwell architecture, but demand continues to head higher.\nThat's because Nvidia's CUDA software platform, which allows developers to \"speed up their applications by harnessing the power of GPU accelerators,\" has led to a 3x jump in AI inference workloads on the company's Hopper flagship processor, the H100. As a result, cloud service providers have been able to significantly lower their costs of running popular AI models.\nAnd now, Nvidia is all set to double down on the AI chip opportunity by bringing its Blackwell chips into full production. The company points out that the demand for its Blackwell processors \"is well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year.\"\nThe chipmaker enjoys an almost monopolistic position in the AI chip market with an estimated market share of 95% thanks to the technology lead it enjoys over rivals. Moreover, Nvidia's ability to speed up existing hardware with the CUDA software platform, which it offers for free, gives its customers the incentive to wait to get their hands on its chips.\nSo, it is not surprising to see that Nvidia's rivals haven't been able to gain much traction in the AI chip market despite the former's supply constraints. This also explains why Nvidia's outlook points toward another terrific year.\nThe company has guided for $28 billion in revenue in the current quarter, which would be a 107% increase from the year-ago period. Additionally, the company is projecting a non-GAAP (adjusted) gross margin of 75.5% for the current quarter, which would be a nice increase over the year-ago period's 71.2%. So, Nvidia is on track to deliver another quarter of impressive growth in revenue and earnings.\nMore importantly, the company's fiscal Q1 revenue and fiscal Q2 guidance suggest that it is on track to finish the first half of the year with $54 billion in revenue.\u00a0That's nearly 90% of the revenue the chipmaker delivered in fiscal 2024. Market research firm Omdia predicts\u00a0Nvidia could sell $87 billion worth of data center GPUs this year, and the segment's revenue in fiscal Q1 indicates that it is well on track to hit that mark.\nAll this indicates why Nvidia's revenue in fiscal 2025 is set to surpass $100 billion, followed by more gains over the next couple of years.\nNvidia stock is currently trading at 62 times trailing earnings, which is a discount to its five-year average earnings multiple of 67. There is no doubt that the stock is richly valued compared to the U.S. technology sector's average of 42, but the pace at which it is growing justifies its valuation. As the following chart indicates, Nvidia's bottom-line growth has simply taken off in the past year, allowing it to justify its price-to-earnings ratio.\nAdditionally, Nvidia's forward earnings multiple of 43 points toward more growth in the company's bottom line. That's not surprising considering how rapidly Nvidia's data center business is forecast to grow in 2025. Investors, therefore, can still consider buying more shares of Nvidia as the booming demand for AI chips and the company's dominant position in this space could send this AI stock even higher.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Pras Subramanian    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang believes Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) full self-driving (FSD) system is the most advanced system out right now. It also just so happens that Tesla\u2019s FSD is powered by Nvidia's chips.\n\u201cTesla is far ahead in self-driving cars,\u201d Huang said in an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance.\n\"One of the things that's really revolutionary about version 12 of Tesla's full self-driving is that it's an end-to-end generative model,\" Huang added.\n\"It learns from watching videos \u2014 surround video \u2014 and it learns about how to drive end-to-end, and using generative AI, predict the path and how to understand and how to steer the car. So the technology is really revolutionary and the work that [Tesla\u2019s] doing is incredible.\"\nTesla's latest FSD, version 12, is currently in beta mode and was rolled out in 30-day free trials to new owners earlier this year. FSD currently costs $99 a month or $8,000 up-front. Tesla reported in April that FSD had over 1.3 billion cumulative miles driven since its debut in March 2021.\nFSD is still considered a Level 2 autonomous system, meaning it requires supervised use, and has been subject to recalls and government inquiries into its capabilities.\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia reported automotive revenue of $329 million, a small sliver of the $22.6 billion in its data center business but up 17% sequentially and up 11% year over year.\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said on the company\u2019s earnings call she expects automotive to be the \u201clargest enterprise vertical within [the] Data Center [segment] this year,\u201d and a potential multibillion-dollar business for the company.\nMost of Nvidia's Data Center revenue, which tallied $22.6 billion the first quarter, came from consumer internet customers. Cloud providers, or the so-called hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), accounted for a \"mid-40s percentage\" of this segment's revenue.\nHuang also told Yahoo Finance he expects one day \"every single car\" will have some level of autonomous ability \u2014 a development that will require huge amounts of computing power.\n\u201cThis technology is very similar to the technology of large language models, but it requires just an enormous training facility,\" Huang said, referring to Tesla's FSD system. \"And the reason for that is because there's videos, the data rate of video, the amount of data of video is so, so high.\"\nFor example, in order to boost Tesla\u2019s ability to process that amount of data, Nvidia said it helped the company expand its FSD training AI cluster to 35,000 Nvidia Hopper H100 GPUs.\nIn addition to Tesla, Nvidia's other automotive sector clients include Mercedes, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo, and Hyundai, as well as Chinese EV upstarts like BYD (BYD) and NIO (NIO).\nWall Street is also bullish on Nvidia\u2019s automotive business.\nIn a note published Thursday, analysts at JPMorgan boosted their Nvidia price target to $1,150 from $850, modeling the chipmaker\u2019s data center business with a 20-30% annual growth rate with Nvidia monetizing \"an incremental ~$14 billion of auto revenue pipeline\" over the next three to four years.\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  Matthew Fox ",
        "Text": "Nvidia stock still has 22% upside, even after its near-doubling this year, according to Goldman Sachs.\nThe bank argued that Nvidia's valuation is still relatively cheap given its fast growth rate.\nGoldman was encouraged by strong spending trends on AI infrastructure by mega-cap tech giants.\nNvidia stock still has plenty of upside even after its year-to-date rally of 81%, according to a Tuesday note from Goldman Sachs.\nThe bank raised its Nvidia price target to $1,100 from $1,000, representing potential upside of 22% from current levels.\nAccording to Goldman, Nvidia stock still trades at a relatively attractive valuation compared to its peers given how quickly it is growing and how durable those growth trends look in the coming years.\n\"We see positive EPS revisions driving another leg up in the stock, especially with NVDA trading at 35x or only a 36% premium to our coverage universe vs. its past 3-year median premium of 160%,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari said.\nHari was specifically encouraged by recent comments from the mega-cap tech giants, which suggested on their earnings call that they will be spending even more money on AI infrastructure in 2025, following an elevated year of investment in 2024.\nThose investments should power continued revenue and profit growth at Nvidia, especially with its next-generation Blackwell AI chip set to be released later this year. Nvidia will report its earnings results on May 22 after the market close.\n\"Notable intra-quarter data points that support the view that AI spending is likely to continue beyond 2024 include\" commentary from tech-focused companies, Hari said.\n1. TSMC reiterated its near- and long-term outlooks for the AI market, and expects server AI processor revenue to more than double year-over-year.\n2. Tier-1 hyperscalers like Amazon and Meta Platforms said or implied that AI-related capital investments are likely to increase in 2025 from an already elevated base in 2024.\n3. Some AI hyperscalers and enterprise software companies highlighted early signs of AI monetization.\n4. AMD raised its 2024 revenue guidance for its AI-focused GPU chip, the Mi300 to $4 billion from $3.5 billion.\n5. Super Micro Computer reported strong revenue growth and a record backlog driven by elevated demand for AI servers.\nAnd while competition is starting to encroach on Nvidia's GPU business via AMD's new chip and in-house chip design from mega-cap tech companies, that won't be enough to knock down the company, according to Hari.\n\"We believe Nvidia will remain the de facto industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive advantage that spans its hardware and software capabilities as well as the installed base and eco-system it has built over multiple decades, and the pace at which it is and will be innovating over the next several years,\" Hari said.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Author": "  DAVID HAMILTON ",
        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Nvidia on Wednesday overshot Wall Street estimates as its profit skyrocketed, bolstered by the chipmaking dominance that has made the company an icon of the artificial intelligence boom.\nIts net income rose more than sevenfold compared to a year earlier, jumping to $14.88 billion in its first quarter that ended April 28 from $2.04 billion a year earlier. Revenue more than tripled, rising to $26.04 billion from $7.19 billion in the previous year.\n\u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun,\u201d CEO Jensen Huang declared on a conference call with analysts. Huang predicted that the companies snapping up Nvidia chips will use them to build a new type of data centers he called \u201cAI factories\u201d designed to produce \u201ca new commodity \u2014 artificial intelligence.\u201d\nHuang added that training AI models is becoming a faster process as they learn to become \u201cmultimodal\u201d \u2014 that is, capable of understanding text, speech, images, video and 3-D data \u2014 and also \u201cto reason and plan.\u201d\nThe company reported earnings per share \u2014 adjusted to exclude one-time items \u2014 of $6.12, well above the $5.60 that Wall Street analysts had expected, according to FactSet. It also announced a 10-for-1 stock split, a move that it noted will make its shares more accessible to employees and investors.\nAnd it increased its dividend to 10 cents a share from 4 cents.\nShares in Nvidia Corp. rose 6% in after-hours trading to $1,006.89. The stock has risen more than 200% in the past year.\nThe company, based in Santa Clara, California, carved out an early lead in the hardware and software needed to tailor its technology to AI applications, partly because founder and CEO Jensen Huang began to nudge the company into what was then seen as a still half-baked technology more than a decade ago. It also makes chips for gaming and cars.\nThe company now boasts the third highest market value on Wall Street, behind only Microsoft and Apple.\n\u201cNvidia defies gravity again,\u201d Jacob Bourne, an analyst with Emarketer, said of the quarterly report. While many tech companies are eager to reduce their dependence on Nvidia, which has achieved a level of hardware dominance in AI rivaling that of earlier computing pioneers such as Intel Corp., \u201cthey\u2019re not quite there yet,\u201d he added.\nDemand for generative AI systems that can compose documents, make images and serve as increasingly lifelike personal assistants has fueled astronomical sales of Nvidia\u2019s specialized AI chips over the past year. Tech giants Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have all signaled they will need to spend more in coming months on the chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.\nWhat happens after that could be another matter. Some analysts believe the breakneck race to build those huge data centers will eventually peak, potentially spelling trouble for Nvidia in the aftermath.\n\u201cThe biggest question that remains is how long this runway is,\u201d Third Bridge analyst Lucas Keh wrote in a research note. AI workloads in the cloud will eventually shift from training to inference, or the more everyday task of processing fresh data using already trained AI systems, he noted. And inference doesn't require the level of power provided by Nvidia's expensive top-of-the-line chips, which will open up market opportunities for chipmakers offering less powerful, but also less costly, alternatives.\nWhen that happens, Keh wrote, \u201cNvidia's dominant market share position will be tested.\u201d\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia overtakes Qualcomm to become the biggest chip designer by revenue, which should give Jensen plenty to smile about",
        "Author": "  Andy Edser ",
        "Text": "It may have escaped your notice, but word on the street is that Nvidia is doing rather well of late. Fourth quarter earnings released earlier this year revealed gigantic revenue and net income figures thanks to surging AI demand, and now a recent report from Trendforce shows that the company has overtaken Qualcomm to become the biggest chip designer by revenue, too.\nThe figures show that Nvidia raked in $55.268 billion in revenue in 2023, in contrast to the second biggest chip designer, Qualcomm, which managed $30.913 billion over the same period. That puts Nvidia firmly at the top of the table, beating out Broadcom, AMD, Mediatek and others by a substantial margin and leaving the company at an estimated market share of 33%, up 15% over the previous year.\nNotable by their absence in these figures are Intel and Samsung, as the list doesn't seem to include chip makers with their own fabrication facilities. Presumably Intel will appear once the switch to its \"internal foundry model\" is complete, splitting the fabrication and design departments in the process.\nStill, these figures are sure to put a smile on the face of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has been busy announcing next-generation Blackwell AI GPUs that already seem to be flying off the racks, \u00a0and has even occasionally found the time to drop off the odd unit in person.\nNvidia is said to now have captured over 80% of the AI accelerator market thanks to strong sales of its H100 AI GPU, with revenue growth predicted to continue to rise into 2024 thanks to the new Blackwell chips. AMD's revenue meanwhile fell by 4% to $22.68 billion last year, with the slight stumble attributed to sluggish PC demand and inventory reduction.\nWhile Nvidia appears to top the charts for now, it'll be interesting to see if Qualcomm can pull some of that lead back with sales of consumer chips. The company is said to be actively promoting the automotive market, and expects revenues in that sector to more than double by 2030.\nAs for AMD, its AI GPU MI300 series is expected to be a major revenue driver in 2024. Recent financial statements released by the company have shown that server CPU sales, alongside heavily increased AI GPU revenue, have both led to large financial gains in the first quarter of this year, although its gaming division appears to be struggling.\nHaving a strong foothold in AI hardware seems to have done wonders for Nvidia's figures, and certainly bodes well for continued revenue in the coming months. The company seems to have been raking in the gains, and with these sorts of earnings and a sustained AI demand that seems to show no signs of slowing, it's difficult to imagine any of its competitors knocking it off the top spot for a long while to come.\n"

        "Author": "  Eric Reed ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA makes computer processors. The company started out, primarily, in the video game and graphic design market. In the late 90's and early 2000's, it was known mainly as a leading company in the relatively niche high-performance gaming industry.\nToday, it is one of the biggest tech companies in the world with a market cap of $2.25 trillion ($NVDA), and it is a main hardware supplier for major emerging technologies such as AI and cryptography. Here's what you need to know.\nThere\u2019s alpha in information. Sign up for the Market Minute newsletter to get summaries of stock market and economic news delivered right to your inbox.\nNVIDIA's core business model is the production of specialized, high-end computer processors. These chips are called \"graphics processor units,\" or GPUs.\nA GPU is a specialized form of processor. It supports the central processing unit, or \"CPU,\" by taking on specific, high-demand tasks as they emerge. This allows your computer to operate normally while also running demanding software because, instead of having to put all other processes on hold, the CPU can hand off single, complicated calculations to the GPU.\u00a0In essence, it\u2019s a difference of breadth vs. depth.\nA central processing chip is built to handle many different tasks at the same time, and its purpose is to run your computer overall. However, as a result, it has fewer resources for any given task. So, for example, the CPU can run the relatively simple calculations of your operating system, web browser and word processor all at once. But it will take a long time to process very complicated demands, which can slow down your computer overall. To do this, the CPU uses a physical architecture known as \u201cserial processing.\u201d\nA graphics processor unit, on the other hand, is built to do one specialized task at a time, and . It can dedicate all of its resources to a single calculation by breaking the task down into smaller, repetitive units, but it cannot handle simultaneous demands. So, for example, a GPU can handle the enormously complicated math of rendering three dimensional images very quickly (historically the most common use case for a GPU), but it would move very slowly if tasked to run four different programs. This is a physical architecture known as \u201cparallel processing.\u201d\nThe name \"graphics processing unit\" comes from the fact that, originally, GPUs were mainly used for graphics rendering in video games. Originally these chips were known as \"ASICs,\" or \"Application Specific Integrated Circuits. During the 1990's and 2000's, video games overwhelmingly drove the demand for high end consumer-level hardware, and GPUs found an early niche in meeting this demand.\nHowever, that is simply an accident of market demand, not a function of hardware limitations. NVIDIA makes sophisticated computer processors designed to supplement core processing and solve specific, high-demand needs. In recent years, demand for specialized computing has grown significantly. These chips are used, among other industries, for blockchain mines, artificial intelligence processing, and data storage and distribution. As a result, demand for NVIDIA's chipsets has grown, and today industry-specific uses such as data centers and AI have surpassed consumer graphics as the core of the company's business model.\nNVIDIA does make a range of additional products beyond the GPU, including laptops, cloud computing, and networking hardware. However the company is overwhelmingly known for their application specific chips, which make up the bulk of their brand and revenue.\nSign up for the Market Minute newsletter for summaries of the latest stock and economic news.\nNVIDIA was founded in 1993.\u00a0The company was an early developer of GPU/ASIC technology, and was one of the first companies to turn these specialized chips into a consumer-oriented product.\nDuring the first 20 years, the company specialized in graphics and gaming. Its core product, GPUs, also became known as \"graphics cards\" and are sold as add-ons for consumer computers. Customers can buy these products and add them to the mainboard of their computers, although to do this you need a desktop computer (rather than a laptop or tablet) and the computer must be capable of accepting modifications (rather than a sealed unit). Only particularly demanding gaming and graphics applications need this kind of hardware, so the consumer base has always been largely limited to hobby computer gamers and graphic artists.\nThis combination of hardware and market limitations make graphics cards a specialty product. During the 90's and 2000's, NVIDIA became the industry standard within this niche. Arguably its only major competitors have historically been AMD and Intel, and even with Intel the company produces built-in graphics processors rather than supplemental hardware.\nFor most of its history, this remained NVIDIA\u2019s position. It has been the gold standard for a specialty product, and in doing so it significantly contributed to semiconductor technology and production techniques used industry-wide.\nNVIDIA IPO\u2019ed in 1999 on the strength of core products such as the RIVA and GeForce processor lines. Starting in the 2000s, NVIDIA became a supplier for video game consoles, including providing the graphics cards for Microsoft's X-Box and Sony's PlayStation. During this era, the company also began branching out into light industry uses, most notably providing graphics chips for automakers' heads-up displays.\nIn the 2010s, NVIDIA saw its business model begin to shift. During this era, entirely new software industries emerged that focused more on single, high-demand tasks. This included blockchain mines, high-volume data storage and distribution, video streaming, and artificial intelligence. This was a change from previous industry emphasis on efficient software that did more with less hardware, and it was an excellent fit for NVIDIA \u2018sspecialty chipsets. This was particularly successful due to the company's CUDA line of products, released in 2006 and built for research-oriented applications.\nSince 2010, NVIDIA's business has moved steadily toward these industry-oriented practices. While the company still produces consumer graphics cards, and arguably remains the industry leader in that field, its main revenue now comes from corporate processor demand. Its biggest customers currently include firms such as OpenAI, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla.\nHowever that success has brought increasing scrutiny from the federal government. In recent years the FTC has increasingly begun looking at NVIDIA's market dominance from an antitrust perspective, which has in turn caused the company to back off from potential acquisitions. htt\nAt time of writing, NVIDIA is one of the most valuable publicly traded stocks in the United States. It had a stock price (NASDAQ: NVDA) of $887 per share and a market cap of $2.22 trillion. By comparison, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) had a share price of $189 and a market cap of $1.97 trillion and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) had a share price of $171 and a market cap of $2.11 trillion.\nNVIDIA has global operations. Its consumer-level business sells chips worldwide, except for jurisdictions in which the U.S. forbids it to do business (in some cases due to national security concerns). It operates offices across North America, South America, Asia and Europe.\nMoney is always in motion.

        "Text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders are pricing in a big move for Nvidia\u2019s shares after the chipmaker reports earnings on Wednesday, though expectations for volatility are more muted than in the past, U.S. options markets show.\nNvidia's options are primed for an 8.7% swing in either direction by Friday, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert. That would translate to a market cap swing of $200 billion - larger than the market capitalization for about 90% of S&P 500 companies.\nWhile massive by most measures, that implied move would fall far short of the 16.4% jump Nvidia\u2019s shares notched after the company\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings report. It is also less aggressive than the average 12% move traders had priced for the last eight quarters.\n\"Volatility and expectations had been a fair amount higher the last time around,\" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.\nNvidia, up about 87% this year, is seen as a bellwether of the burgeoning AI industry and has a market value of about $2.3 trillion, making it the third-largest company on Wall Street, behind Microsoft and Apple. Wall Street is betting on a blowout quarterly report from Nvidia.\nInvestor interest has spread out to other beneficiaries of the AI theme in recent months.\n\"AI benefits are broadening out to power, commodities and utilities,\" BofA strategists including Gonzalo Asis wrote in a note on Monday. \"It's not just about NVDA anymore.\"\nBofA\u2019s strategists expect the company to drive 9% of the S&P 500 earnings growth over the next 12 months, compared to 37% over the last 12 months.\nThat\u2019s not to say the upcoming earnings report is expected to be uneventful for the company\u2019s share price.\nMatt Amberson, founder of options analytics service ORATS, noted that implied volatility for out of the money calls is roughly equal to that of out of the money puts. That suggests options traders are not writing off the possibility of more upside for the stock, despite its already-hefty year-to-date gains.\n\"Traders expect up moves to be as violent as down moves,\" Amberson said.\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $5.59 a share, and a rise in quarterly revenue to $24.65 billion from $7.19 billion a year ago, according to LSEG data.\nSteve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said a downturn in Nvidia could test investors\u2019 resolve regarding the broader AI trade.\n\"Yes, the rally has broadened out, but I'm not sure how sturdy it would be if Nvidia sold off hard,\" he said.\n\"There is a lot riding on the AI trade,\" Sosnick said.\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Lincoln Feast.)\n"

        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Taking profits in chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was a popular move among billionaire hedge fund managers in the first quarter, with a number of notable ones reducing their stakes in the company. Given the run the stock has had, it perhaps should be of little surprise that some big-name investors were taking some profits.\nAmong the billionaires reducing their stakes in Nvidia were Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Capital Management, David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investments, and Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management.\nDruckenmiller talked about his reason for reducing his stake in Nvidia, saying in a CNBC interview that he still liked Nvidia but that artificial intelligence (AI) might be overhyped in the near term. However, he said the big payoff could be big in four to five years and that AI may be underhyped in the long term.\nWhile it's common to see billionaire hedge fund managers taking some profits in a stock like Nvidia, several top hedge fund managers are also piling into Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Among the investors aggressively buying the stock in Q1 were Chase Coleman of Tiger Global, Glen Kacher of Light Street Capital, Gavin Baker of Atreides Management, and Foxhaven Asset Management's Michael Pausic and Nick Lawler.\nLet's look at why these investors might think Alphabet is an attractive investment.\nOne of the first things that tends to grab hedge fund managers' attention is valuation. Alphabet trades at a pretty large discount compared to many other AI-related stocks with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of only 23.6 times. A number of rivals are trading at over 35 times.\nIn addition, that is below the multiple where Alphabet has traded historically before the pandemic when it would often trade above a 30 times P/E ratio.\nThat gives Alphabet stock room to run higher, but valuation alone is not a reason that well-regarded hedge fund managers would buy the stock.\nAn investment in Alphabet is an investment in a company that has two dominant businesses with Google search and video platform YouTube. Google is nearly a monopoly with about an estimated 90% share in global search. While there have been some fears of AI impacting its search business, the company is embracing the technology, rolling out AI overlays at the top of page results to answer more complex questions.\nAlphabet will look toward new ad formats to help monetize its latest AI efforts to drive growth. With only about 20% of its search results including ads, this is actually a pretty large opportunity for Google search to become even more profitable in the future by monetizing the search results it doesn't make money from currently.\nAlphabet's YouTube platform should also not be overlooked. While many streaming services outside of Netflix have struggled with profitably due to content costs, the revenue-sharing model that Alphabet uses with creators has long alleviated these issues. Meanwhile, the company has a strong opportunity to profit from short-form videos that compete with TikTok, which it has just started to monetize. If its competitor gets banned in the U.S., this could be a big opportunity for the company.\nIn addition, Alphabet's cloud computing business is still in the early days of ramping up profitability. Given the high fixed costs of the business, profitability should now grow much faster than revenue, which will be driven by AI adoption.\nAlphabet is a relatively inexpensive stock with a dominant position in search and a big opportunity ahead of it with AI. While the stock has had a strong year, up about 27% year to date, it is not too late to follow hedge fund billionaires into the stock.\nThe company has a long runway of growth ahead and multiple expansion potential (which is an increase in its valuation multiples, such as P/E). Together that is a powerful combination and makes the stock a buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 9.3% on Thursday, closing above $1,000 for the first time and giving the chip giant a market cap north of $2.5 trillion after reporting first quarter earnings that once again blew away forecasts.\nNvidia's first quarter results, released after the bell on Wednesday, showed adjusted earnings per share (EPS) tallied $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, a jump of 461% and 262%, respectively, from a year ago.\nThe company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split and an increased dividend, following some of its Big Tech peers in doling out heftier quarterly payments to shareholders.\nAnalysts were expecting adjusted EPS of $5.65 on revenue of $24.69 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. The company reported adjusted EPS of $1.09 on revenue of $7.19 billion in the same quarter last year.\nIn the current quarter, Nvidia expects revenue of $28 billion, plus or minus 2%. That\u2019s better than the $26.6 billion analysts had expected.\n\u201cOur data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. \"Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\"\nWall Street analysts have previously raised concerns about the share of Nvidia's Data Center revenue that comes from hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and other Big Tech names. That's especially true as those companies roll out their own AI accelerator chips.\nIn an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance following the company's earnings report on Wednesday, Huang pushed back against concerns the company could face a demand lull as it shifts between its current and next generation of AI chips.\n\"People want to deploy these data centers right now,\" Huang said. \"They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\"\nNvidia's Data Center revenue jumped 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion. CFO Colette Kress said in a statement on Wednesday that large cloud providers accounted for around 45% of the company's Data Center revenue.\nIn a note to clients published Thursday, JPMorgan analysts led by Harlan Sur wrote Nvidia, \"continues to maintain a 1-2 step lead ahead of competitors.\" JPMorgan raised its price target on Nvidia stock to $1,150 from $850 and reiterated an Overweight rating on shares.\nOn the company's earnings call, Kress pointed out that revenue out of China was down significantly in the quarter, as the company was forced to halt shipments of its most powerful chips to the country. The company also expects the market in the region to remain very competitive going forward.\nThe company's stock split \u2014 in which shareholders will receive 10 shares for every one share of the company they currently own \u2014 will be effective June 7, and its new dividend will be paid June 28 to shareholders as of June 11.\nThe stock split will likely fuel speculation Nvidia could be added to the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), joining Big Tech peers like Apple (AAPL), Amazon, and Microsoft.\nNvidia's beefed-up dividend also follows similar moves announced so far this year from the likes of Meta (META) and Alphabet, which both initiated quarterly dividends for the first time, and Apple, which raised its dividend earlier this month.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Who\u2019s Next for India?\nShort Sellers in Danger of Extinction After Crushing Stock Gains\nIndian Stocks Lead Gains in Asia as Modi Ally Pledges Support\nFrom Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s Cristiano Amon, the biggest names in PC and chipmaking are joining Huang at Computex 2024 to exhibit the progress they\u2019ve made in laying the foundation for technologies from ChatGPT-like AI to future smart devices. Those CEOs will make the case for their own products but also huddle in a search for answers to the most pressing issues facing the global tech sector, from geopolitical ructions and conflict to constrained supply of essential components such as high-bandwidth memory.\nUppermost on their minds is how to harness AI and ready their businesses for the coming change. Qualcomm\u2019s betting on a partnership with Microsoft Corp. around new AI PCs that\u2019ll bring its pedigree of smartphone processors to laptops. Pat Gelsinger of Intel Corp. and Arm Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Rene Haas will present their contrasting visions for the future of computing, while Tainan-born Huang will be asked how Nvidia plans to respond to Qualcomm\u2019s new venture.\n\u201cThis is a massive inflection, it is the biggest moment in the PC business in decades,\u201d said Dan Newman, CEO and chief analyst at the Futurum Group. \u201cAI is the hottest trend with the longest trail, it\u2019s the earliest innings, and they\u2019re all fighting.\u201d\nTaipei is a fitting location for hashing out those important questions. Its importance in the chip supply chain has never been greater, led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fabricating Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone chips, Nvidia\u2019s must-have AI accelerators, AMD\u2019s competing products and a good chunk of the Arm chips powering the global mobile market. The path to AI breakthroughs is paved with semiconductors and servers, many of which are made or assembled in Taiwan.\nIt\u2019s also home to a coterie of lesser-known players that provide the building blocks for Nvidia\u2019s products. The US company secured a seemingly unassailable lead in AI data centers, with the help of relationships Huang has cultivated with Taiwan\u2019s server makers like Quanta Computer Inc. and, increasingly, Hon Hai Precision Technology Co. His last visit to the island was a marketing tour de force, as he lauded those firms and touted the trillion-dollar opportunity in AI.\nAI servers will become a NT$1 trillion ($31 billion) revenue product at Hon Hai as soon as next year, its Chairman Young Liu said at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Friday.\n\u201cLast year was already hot because of AI. And this year is explosive because AI is accelerating,\u201d said James C. F. Huang, chairman of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), which runs Computex. \u201cWe are like a big magnet.\u201d\nRead more: Taiwan Stands Out as Asia\u2019s AI Canary\nAt a media event during last year\u2019s Computex, Nvidia\u2019s Huang presented an array of AI hardware from the company \u2014 from H100 AI chips to integrated server rack modules and proprietary technologies to help multiple components work like one unified computer. When asked if all those parts were made in Taiwan, Huang said that they were. Taiwan\u2019s dominance has much to do with the fact that neither Intel nor Samsung Electronics Co. have matched TSMC\u2019s technology leadership and manufacturing reliability.\nThat preeminence in the chipmaking and computing spheres is also a source of growing concern for governments, which are wary of the threat of China, which claims the island as part of its territory, taking it over by force. US firms have been asking Taiwanese partners to diversify the geography of their operations, to guard against a potential invasion from the mainland.\nTAITRA\u2019s Huang said that from chips to motherboards to server assemblers, the AI hardware supply chain all comes together in Taiwan, making it an efficient one-stop shop for big tech firms like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft and Meta Platforms Inc. to buy their hardware.\n\u201cAI Semiconductors and AI servers will prop up Taiwan\u2019s economy for another 50 years,\u201d Taiwan\u2019s Minister of Economic Affairs J.W. Kuo said. \u201cTaiwanese firms also make 80% to 90% of all the AI servers in the world.\u201d\nQualcomm may play the role of disruptor at Computex this year, as its Snapdragon chips will feature heavily in the most promoted product at the show: Microsoft\u2019s new breed of Copilot+ PCs. These so-called AI PCs will feature Microsoft\u2019s latest and best collection of AI features \u2014 such as Recall, which keeps a searchable visual history of everything a user does \u2014 and rely on Qualcomm silicon, to the exclusion of Intel and AMD. Everyone from Asustek Computer Inc. to Lenovo Group Ltd. and Dell Technologies Inc. will have such wares to show.\nRead more: Qualcomm Bets on AI to Knock Intel From PC Perch: Tech Daily\nOne key consideration for all the big firms is that \u201cthe first choice customers make tends to stick,\u201d Newman said. So if enterprise customers opt to upgrade to a Qualcomm-based AI computer lineup, they\u2019re likely to keep that going forward, and the chip firms are sending their CEOs to Computex because \u201cthey want to make sure they cement their place in this particular moment.\u201d\nOn the sidelines of the event, the likes of Su and Gelsinger will also be working to grab a share of the limited resources required for producing their AI products.

        "Author": "  Heekyong Yang and Fanny Potkin ",
        "Text": "By Heekyong Yang and Fanny Potkin\nSEOUL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics' latest high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips have yet to pass Nvidia's tests for use in the U.S. firm's AI processors due to heat and power consumption problems, three people briefed on the issues said.\nThe problems affect Samsung's HBM3 chips, which are the fourth-generation HBM standard currently most used in graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence, as well as fifth-generation HBM3E chips that the South Korean tech giant and its rivals are bringing to market this year, they said.\nThe reasons for Samsung failing Nvidia's tests are being reported for the first time.\nSamsung said in a statement to Reuters that HBM is a customized memory product requiring \"optimization processes in tandem with customers' needs,\" adding that it is in the process of optimizing its products through close collaboration with customers. It declined to comment on specific customers.\nIn separate statements after Reuters first published this report, Samsung said that \"claims of failing due to heat and power consumption are not true,\" and that testing was \"proceeding smoothly and as planned.\"\nNvidia declined to comment.\nHBM - a type of dynamic random access memory or DRAM standard first produced in 2013 in which chips are vertically stacked to save space and reduce power consumption - helps process massive amounts of data produced by complex AI applications. As demand for sophisticated GPUs has soared amid the generative AI boom, so has demand for HBM.\nSatisfying Nvidia - which commands around 80% of the global GPU market for AI applications - is seen as key to future growth for HBM manufacturers - both reputationally and in terms of profit momentum.\nSamsung has been trying to pass Nvidia's tests for HBM3 and HBM3E since last year, the three sources said. According to two of the people, the results of a recent failed test for Samsung's 8-layer and 12-layer HBM3E chips came in April.\nIt was not immediately clear if the problems can be easily addressed, but the three sources said that the failures to meet Nvidia's requirements have increased concerns in the industry and among investors that Samsung could fall further behind rivals SK Hynix and Micron Technology in HBM.\nThe sources, two of whom were briefed on the matter by Samsung officials, spoke on condition of anonymity as the information was confidential.\nSamsung's shares fell 2% in early Friday trade, slightly weaker than the broader market.\nNEW CHIP UNIT HEAD\nIn contrast to Samsung, domestic rival SK Hynix is the main supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia and has been supplying HBM3 since June 2022. It also began supplying HBM3E in late March to a customer it declined to identify. Shipments went to Nvidia, sources have said.\nMicron, the only other major manufacturer of HBM, has also said it will supply Nvidia with HBM3E.\nIn a move that analysts said appeared to underscore Samsung's concerns about its laggard position in HBM, Samsung this week replaced the head of its semiconductor unit saying a new person at the top was needed to navigate what it called a \"crisis\" affecting the industry.\nMarket expectations have been high that Samsung, as the world's biggest maker of memory chips, would quickly pass Nvidia's tests, but it's also natural that specialised products like HBM will take some time to meet customers' performance evaluations, said Jeff Kim, head of research at KB Securities.\nAlthough Samsung has yet to become a supplier of HBM3 to Nvidia, it does supply customers such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and is aiming to begin mass production of HBM3E chips in the second quarter. Samsung said in its statement to Reuters that its product schedule is proceeding as planned.\nAnalysts also say that SK Hynix, which developed the first HBM chip in 2013, has spent far more time and resources on HBM research and development than Samsung over the past decade, accounting for its technological edge.\nSamsung said in its statement that it developed the first commercial HBM solution for high-performance computing in 2015 and has continued to invest in HBM since then.\nGPU manufacturers like Nvidia and AMD are keen for Samsung to perfect its HBM chips so they can have more vendor options and weaken SK Hynix's pricing power, the sources also said.\nAt an Nvidia AI conference in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang signed a placard at Samsung's booth that said \"Jensen approved\" for Samsung's 12-layer HBM3E - underscoring the company's enthusiasm about the prospect of Samsung supplying those chips.\nHBM3E chips are likely to become the mainstream HBM product in the market this year with shipments concentrated in the second half of 2024, according to research firm Trendforce.\nSeparately, SK Hynix estimates that demand for HBM memory chips in general could increase at an annual rate of 82% through 2027.\nAnalysts have said that Samsung's relatively weak position in HBM has been noticed by investors. Its shares are down 2% for the year to date, while SK Hynix's stock is up 42% and Micron's shares are up 48%.\n($1 = 1,362.8600 won)\n(Reporting by Heekyong Yang in Seoul and Fanny Potkin in Singapore; Additional reporting by Ju-min Park in Seoul and Max A.

Nvidia commands some 80% of the AI chip market.\nMicron has also said its HBM chips were sold out for 2024 and that the majority of its 2025 supply was already allocated. It plans to provide samples for its 12-layer HBM3E chips to customers in March.\n\"As AI functions and performance are being upgraded faster than expected, customer demand for ultra-high-performance chips such as the 12-layer chips appear to be increasing faster than for 8-layer HBM3Es,\" said Jeff Kim, head of research at KB Securities.\nSamsung Electronics, which plans to produce its HBM3E 12-layer chips in the second quarter, said this week that this year's shipments of HBM chips are expected to increase more than three-fold and it has completed supply discussions with customers. It did not elaborate further.\nLast month, SK Hynix announced a $3.87 billion plan to build an advanced chip packaging plant in the U.S. state of Indiana with an HBM chip line and a 5.3 trillion won ($3.9 billion) investment in a new DRAM chip factory at home with a focus on HBMs.\nKwak said investment in HBM differed from past patterns in the memory chip industry in that capacity is being increased after making certain of demand first.\nBy 2028, the portion of chips made for AI, such as HBM and high-capacity DRAM modules, is expected to account for 61% of all memory volume in terms of value from about 5% in 2023, SK Hynix's head of AI infrastructure Justin Kim said.\nLast week, SK Hynix said in a post-earnings conference call that there may be a shortage of regular memory chips for smartphones, personal computers and network servers by the year's end if demand for tech devices exceeds expectations.\n($1 = 1,375.6700 won)\n(Reporting by Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang; Editing by Ed Davies and Edwina Gibbs)\n"

For these reasons, next Wednesday the company\u2019s earnings report will be the most highly anticipated event of this earning\u2019s season. Nvidia\u2019s cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUS) are powering the AI revolution and, thus, powering the stock. Today, we will examine 3 key items to watch when the Zacks Ranked \u201cStrong Buy\u201d stock reports earnings:\nExpectations\nOn Wall Street, expectations and forward-looking statements are everything. For example, a company could presumably grow their earnings at 90% (which is a very healthy growth rate), but if Wall Street was expecting triple-digit EPS growth, the stock is likely to fall regardless. In addition, if a company reports earnings above Wall Street expectations but communicates an uncertain or slightly negative future quarter, investors will punish the stock.\nIn the case of Nvidia, expectations are sky-high. Zacks consensus estimates suggest that quarterly earnings will explode by 406%, year-over-year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nA Bullish EPS Surprise History\nThough these expectations may seem unrealistic, NVDA\u2019s EPS surprise history says they are possible. NVDA has beat consensus estimates for 18 of the past 20 quarters.\nOdds of a Beat are High\nBeyond NVDA\u2019s strong EPS surprise history NVDA has a best possible Zacks Rank of Strong Buy. Zacks Investment Research\u2019s extensive in-house back testing indicates that stocks with a rank of \u201cHold\u201d (#3) or better coupled with a positive Earnings Surprise Prediction (ESP) score tend to beat on earnings and outperform, with all else equal.\n\u201cBlackwell\u201d Commentary\nNvidia\u2019s latest chip enables organizations to run large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor. Investors will be watching any new commentary on the earnings conference call because Blackwell is seen as a major bullish catalyst by the street.\nChina Impact\nRecent news headlines suggest that Chinese regulators urged local tech firms to buy fewer Nvidia chips.

They will give its customers an alternative to Nvidia's H100 family of powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) which dominate the data center chip market for AI but can be hard to obtain due to high demand.\nTo build AI models or run applications, companies typically must string together - or cluster - multiple GPUs because the data and computation will not fit on a single processor.\nAMD, which expects $4 billion in AI chip revenue this year, has said the chips are powerful enough to train and run large AI models.\nAs well as Nvidia's top-shelf AI chips, Microsoft's cloud computing unit sells access to its own in-house AI chips called Maia.\nSeparately, the Cobalt 100 processors Microsoft plans to preview next week offer 40% better performance over other processors based on Arm Holdings' technology, the company said. Snowflake and others have begun to use them.\nThe Cobalt chips, which were announced in November, are being tested to power Teams, Microsoft's messaging tool for businesses, and positioned to compete with the in-house Graviton CPUs made by Amazon.com.\nAmazon said this week that social network Pinterest and fintech firm Robinhood Markets have started using its Graviton chips.\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) latest earnings report was arguably the most highly anticipated of this earnings season. And the company didn't disappoint the lofty expectations. Revenue soared 262% compared to the prior-year period, with the data center segment once again leading the way.\nSales of $26 billion in the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28) marked the fourth straight period in which the company beat its own revenue guidance by at least $2 billion. And Nvidia sees sales growing to about $28 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nNot surprisingly, the stock has also jumped in a big way. Nvidia shares are up by more than 90% year to date and have more than tripled in the last 12 months. But that doesn't mean it's too late for investors to buy the stock.\nOne concern investors had heading into the latest earnings report was that customers may be holding off purchasing Nvidia's leading artificial intelligence (AI) chips with its more powerful Blackwell generative AI architecture, due to begin shipping later this year.\nBut there is such strong demand for Nvidia's products that large customers waiting for Blackwell would actually be a good thing. It would allow the long line of smaller customers to jump in now with new orders. On top of that, bigger customers like Meta Platforms, Tesla, and others will still be buying when Blackwell sales start later this year.\nThere's a second good reason why long-term investors should consider owning Nvidia, even after the stock's sharp rise: Nvidia's automotive segment revenue jumped 17% from the previous quarter and 11% from the prior-year period. But that segment is still a very small contributor compared to the data center business.\nNvidia's Drive platform is gaining customers in robotics companies and Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers. If autonomous driving technology takes off in coming years, Nvidia could see another boom in sales similar to what it has experienced from data center buyers.\nThose are good reasons to buy Nvidia now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Missed NVIDIA? Check Out This Semiconductor AI Penny Stock",
        "Author": "  Alexandr Oleinic ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best AI Penny Stocks to Invest in Now\u00a0and in this article we will give you an AI penny stock that can be worthy of exploring in case you missed buying NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) when it was trading under $500 per share at the beginning of the year.\nIt's no secret that semiconductors are among the best pick-and-shovel plays for those looking to invest in the booming Artificial Intelligence sector. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw its stock surge by more than 150% over the past year. This growth can almost solely be attributed to increased demand for its Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), which are perfect for processing large amounts of data required in various AI and machine learning applications.\nAmid this strong performance, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was included in the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\", a group of the largest publicly-traded companies. However, as the AI boom continues, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to continue to deliver solid returns to investors. The stock currently saw its price target upped by Goldman Sachs. Analyst Toshiya Hari raised the price target to $1100 from $1000 and reiterated the 'Buy' rating. In the research note, the analyst mentioned that the sustainable nature of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s growth suggests that the stock is trading at an attractive valuation.\nThe strong fundamentals suggest that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a good pick for risk-averse investors looking for solid long-term returns. Therefore, it's not surprising that the stock is one of the most popular among hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. According to the latest round of 13F filings, 186 out of 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on NVIDIA at the end of March. We are following this metric because our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nHowever, for risk-tolerant investors, we can suggest looking at Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS). Similarly to NVIDIA, Navitas is a semiconductor stock, but it is currently trading at less than $4 per share, which makes it one of the best AI penny stocks to buy now. It may not reach the size of NVIDIA Corporation, but it's worth remembering that in 2014, NVIDIA was trading at less than $5 per share.\nNavitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) is a small-cap company that is focused on power semiconductors, such as gallium nitride power integrated circuits and silicon carbide power devices. Basically, it is developing semiconductors that are used in power supply for various devices. In this way, Navitas' products have a wide range of applications, including mobile phones, laptops, and consumer electronics. Moreover, Navitas supplies semiconductors to some high-growth industries, such as Data Centers, electric vehicles, and solar inverters. Among the company's clients are Dell, Lenovo, Xiaomi, Amazon, OPPO, and Motorola. Most of the company's products that are currently being shipped are used in mobile device chargers.\nA technician in a pristine lab, focused on designing a new semiconductor chip.\nOn a financial side, things look good for Navitas. The company has seen strong revenue growth over the past several quarters. In the first quarter of 2023, Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) saw its revenue grow by 73% to $23.2 million. The company has been seeing robust top-line growth over the past several quarters. However, the costs are also quite high and Navitas has yet to report a profitable quarter. For the first quarter, Navitas posted a net loss of $0.02 per share, significantly lower than the $0.39 loss posted a year earlier. Both first-quarter revenue and net loss were above analysts' expectations of $22.92 million and a loss of $0.15 per share, respectively.\nDespite the revenue growth and the further revenue growth potential, Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) has seen its stock lose 48% since the beginning of the year. In an environment where most semiconductor stocks recorded gains, this doesn't look good. One of the reasons for the decline, was explained by the company's CEO Gene Sheridan on CNBC.\n\"We're not shipping to AI today, so our stock price reflects that,\" Sheridan said.\nHowever, the CEO added that Navitas plans to change that soon. The company plans to develop and market power chip technology that could be used to power AI-focused data centers. The company is developing power platforms that could provide higher power output to meet the demand required by AI processors, such as NVIDIA's Grace Hopper H100 and recently announced Blackwell chips. These chips demand between 700W to 1,000W and more power, which is significantly higher than 300W demanded by traditional CPUs. Navitas said it has around 30 customer projects in development and expects its power chips to be used in data centers at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s AWS, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Azure, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).\nCheck out our report about the cheapest AI stock and find out which company is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than five times its earnings.\nAs stated earlier, we believe that Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) is one of the best AI penny stocks to buy now based on the hedge fund sentiment. At the end of March, there were 11 funds in our database bullish on the stock, down from 18 a quarter earlier. At the end of March, these funds held $80 million worth of shares.\nAnalysts also generally see potential upside in Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS). In May, following the earnings release, four analysts reiterated their buy ratings on the stock, although they did lower their price targets. Among these, the highest price target is currently assigned by Rosenblatt Securities, which has a $10 target. Other three analysts, at Robert W. Baird, Needham & Company LLC, and Deutsche Bank have a $7.00 price target. On the other hand, analysts at Jefferies, downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy and slashed the price target down to $4.00.\nIn conclusion, Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) is a penny stock worth exploring. The company is advancing its developments to get more exposure to the AI sector, albeit it is late to the party. On the other hand, it has a broad pipeline of applications across various sectors and can unlock more growth in other areas. For example, in automotive, Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) plans to start production of chips for EV chargers and has several big names among its customers, including Volvo, Smart, and Zeekr Intelligent Technology Holding Ltd (NYSE:ZK).\nIf you want to explore other AI stocks under $5 that smart money is bullish on, check out our free report on the 11 Best AI Penny Stocks to Invest in Now.\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Micron but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nRead Next: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Avi Kapoor ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares closed slightly higher during Wednesday's session, continuing its rally.\nThe chipmaker giant's stock has gained every trading session since releasing its stronger-than-expected earnings report last Wednesday. Since then, shares of Nvidia has jumped around 21%.\nOn May 22, Nvidia reported better-than-expected financial results for its first quarter and issued strong guidance for the second quarter. The company announced a 10-for-1 stock split and raised its quarterly dividend by 150%.\nThe megacap tech name has seen an astounding 186% surge since the end of May 2023, fueled by skyrocketing demand for chips in artificial intelligence development.\nWith the recent buzz around Nvidia, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Nvidia offers an annual dividend yield of 0.03%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 10 cents per share (40 cents a year).\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $17,223,750 or around 15,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $3,444,750 or around 3,000 shares.\nRead This: Top 3 Tech And Telecom Stocks That Could Blast Off This Quarter\nView more earnings on NVDA\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.40 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.40 = 15,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.40 = 3,000 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock\u2019s current price.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nNVDA Price Action: Shares of Nvidia gained 0.8% to close at $1,148.25 on Wednesday.\nRead More: Jim Cramer Recommends Buying Apple, Finds This Tech Stock \u2018Very Interesting\u2018\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Nvidia Stock Following Strong Earnings Report originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Author": "South China Morning Post ",
        "Text": "US-sanctioned Huawei Technologies has emerged as a key supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips in China after Washington implemented export curbs on Nvidia's advanced processors, according to industry insiders.\nUse of the Chinese company's self-developed 910B Ascend chips have proliferated in various industries across the country through \"AI boxes\" - all-in-one machines that combine AI chips, industry-specific algorithms and pre-trained large AI models.\nHuawei's chips are becoming popular components in these Chinese-made machines, setting up the company to take over a market that has so far been dominated by Nvidia.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nNvidia has designed lower-grade chips tailored for China-based clients after the US in October escalated its export restrictions to ban the shipments of the firm's sophisticated A800, H800 and L40S processors to the country.\nBut the onslaught of Huawei's Ascend chips has proved challenging for Nvidia in its third-largest market. CEO Jensen Huang said in a conference call earlier this month that the US firm faces \"a lot more competition in China now\".\nHuawei declined to provide sales figures for its AI chips, but according to a speech this month by Zhang Dixuan, head of the firm's Ascend computing business, the Ascend ecosystem now has 40 hardware partners, 1,600 software partners, and 2,900 AI application solutions.\n\"Huawei is taking the lead in China's localisation drive because of its technological abilities,\" said Russel Wu, general manager at networking gear start-up TML and previously with Intel in China.\n\"The AI box provides a ready-to-use solution for entities including small companies and government, letting them cut costs and focus on fine-tuning large model-based services instead of developing models [from scratch].\"\nChinese companies are taking advantage of Huawei chips to make AI boxes to meet the rising demand for AI computing from nearly all industries, from telecommunications to finance and healthcare.\nTianjin Sitonholy, a key Nvidia distributor in China before it was added to a US trade blacklist in April, has launched an AI box embedded with Huawei graphics processors and software developed by Chinese company Thunder Software.\nChinese AI start-up SenseTime's co-founder and CEO Xu Li told the Post in an exclusive interview on Tuesday that its generative AI sales are expected to double this year, thanks to the strong sales of AI boxes, which cost from 300,000 yuan (around US$40,000) to over 2 million yuan.\nHome-grown chips, including those from Huawei, Cambricon Technologies and Biren Technology, are readily available in the market, according to Xu.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang.

AI boxes are predicted to be a must-have for businesses in China, and the market is set to be dominated by local players led by Huawei, wrote Cao Pei, an analyst at Chinese brokerage Pacific Securities, in a research note published in November.\nAI boxes received a boost in China last July when Huawei unveiled a large-language-model training solution tailored for Chinese clients, together with local AI start-ups ModelBest, Zhipu AI, iFlyTek and CloudWalk.\niFlyTek, which is also under US sanctions, last August introduced its Spark Number 1 AI box, which packs Huawei Ascend chips and touts sufficient computing power to support a wide range of AI applications and model training.\n\"iFlyTek and Huawei have joined forces to tackle the computing-power bottleneck\", iFlyTek chairman Liu Qingfeng said at the time, adding that Spark Number 1 was benchmarked against Nvidia's A100 processor, which has been barred from being shipped to China since August 2022, along with the more powerful H100.\nNvidia processors made up 90 per cent of the 500,000 AI chips that were sold in China in the first half of last year, with Huawei controlling just 6 per cent of the market. But the tide is turning for Huawei: at least a dozen Chinese companies have launched AI boxes, and most of them use chips from Huawei.\nThe headquarters of Nvidia in Santa Clara, California.

Nvidia is set to report its first quarter earnings after the U.S. market close on Wednesday.\nThe firm, which is at the heart of a massive, AI-fueled spike in valuation over the past year, has come to be regarded as a bellwether for the tech industry, specifically due to its exposure to AI.\nNvidia is expected to clock quarterly revenue of $24.65 billion and earnings of $5.59 per share according to Reuters estimates, with both figures set to increase exponentially from the same period last year.\nThe firm, which currently makes the most advanced AI chips in the market, has benefited substantially from a massive push into AI investment by the tech industry.

Recent quarterly filings show that he even bought call options in Nvidia stock to help boost his investment exposure.\nTuesday on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d Druckenmiller noted that he recently reduced his exposure to Nvidia because of the stock\u2019s incredible surge from around $150 per share to more than $900 per share in just over a year.\n\u201cI'm not Warren Buffett,\u201d Druckenmiller said. \u201cI don't own things for 10 or 20 years. I wish I was Warren Buffett.\u201d\nThere have been several beneficiaries of the AI boom, but Nvidia is certainly the poster child, as its AI chips have experienced exorbitant demand as other company\u2019s race to train and build their own AI models. Nvidia shares have more than tripled over a one-year period. The stock rallied 238% in 2023 and is already up another 66% year-to-date.\nDruckenmiller told CNBC that he initially doubled down on his Nvidia position when Microsoft-backed ChatGPT surged in popularity.\n\u201cEven an old guy like me could figure out what that meant,\u201d Druckenmiller said.\nCheck This Out: ChatGPT Is Not A \u2018Long-Term\u2019 Engagement Model, OpenAI\u2019s Top Executive Says: \u2018Today\u2019s Systems Are Laughably Bad\u2019\nAt that time, he expected to hold his Nvidia position for at least two or three years as he anticipated that the AI boom was going to be a \u201cmega trend like we\u2019ve never seen\u201d and could potentially be bigger than the internet, he said.\n\u201cI just need a break.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) came out with quarterly earnings of $6.12 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.49 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.09 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 11.48%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence would post earnings of $4.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.16, delivering a surprise of 13.41%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\nNvidia , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, posted revenues of $26.04 billion for the quarter ended April 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.02%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $7.19 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nNvidia shares have added about 92.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 11.6%.\nWhat's Next for Nvidia?\nWhile Nvidia has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Nvidia: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $5.84 on $26.24 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $24.52 on $108.24 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor - General is currently in the bottom 16% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\nOne other stock from the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Nutanix (NTNX), is yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 29.\nThis enterprise cloud platform services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +325%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nNutanix's revenues are expected to be $516.13 million, up 15.1% from the year-ago quarter.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Customer and employee service avatars demoed for ServiceNow Now Assist, powered by NVIDIA speech, LLM, and animation generative AI technology, highlight the potential for even more engaging, personal, employee and customer experiences\nLAS VEGAS, May 08, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Knowledge 2024 \u2014 Today at ServiceNow\u2019s annual customer and partner event, Knowledge 24, ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the AI platform for business transformation, showcased AI avatars of the future together with NVIDIA, leveraging NVIDIA\u2019s Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) speech, large language model (LLM), and animation technologies that bring digital characters to life using generative AI. The AI avatars were revealed on stage at Knowledge 24 during ServiceNow President and Chief Operating Officer CJ Desai\u2019s keynote, with a special appearance from NVIDIA Founder and CEO Jensen Huang, highlighting the potential for even more engaging, personal, employee and customer experiences.\nThe visionary demo is part of the strategic collaboration between ServiceNow and NVIDIA to advance and expand options for workflow engagements across organizations. This comes amid a Gartner\u00ae prediction that, \"by 2026, 60% of GenAI solutions will be multimodal, up from 1% in 2023.\"*\nExpanding on the companies\u2019 partnership, the interactive, real-time avatars demoed leveraging Now Assist showcase the potential to provide another communication option for Virtual Agent experiences to users who prefer visual interactions. Similar to other Now Assist capabilities, they leverage NVIDIA technology, including NVIDIA NIM microservices and NVIDIA ACE, all available with the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\nThe ServiceNow Now Assist demo highlights the potential for digital avatars to enhance customer and employee interactions across various industries, particularly those where customer service, engagement, and personalized communication are critical, including retail, travel, and more.\nAt Knowledge 2023 last year, NVIDIA and ServiceNow partnered to develop powerful enterprise\u2011grade generative AI capabilities. These capabilities leverage NVIDIA infrastructure for custom LLMs trained for the Now Platform and have launched new GenAI use cases that can boost productivity for IT operations, customer service teams, and employees.\n\"As AI becomes deeply ingrained in our everyday lives, customers and employees expect technology to intelligently learn and adapt to their individual work and communication styles,\" said Desai. \"We\u2019re continuously expanding our collaboration with NVIDIA to explore new ways for people to interact with generative AI through Now Assist, to help ensure AI is a friendly, engaging, and empathetic experience for everyone, based on users\u2019 preferences.\"\n\"Customer service is essential to healthcare, financial services, telecommunications, and many other industries, making it one of the largest generative AI use cases,\" said Manuvir Das, vice president, enterprise computing at NVIDIA. \"ServiceNow is at the forefront of bringing generative AI to the world\u2019s enterprises to support billions of hours of service requests, and our work together can help us identify new ways to interact with Now Assist so users quickly get the help they need.\"\nPutting a face to Now Assist generative AI experiences across the enterprise\nThe avatars signal the potential to use speech and animation GenAI technology to enhance user interactions for Now Assist across a broad range of business functions. This includes any AI-assisted interaction across HR, finance, IT, and more to add a personal touch to customer and employee requests. Rather than simply typing questions into a chat, users may prefer to speak to, type, or digitally interact with these avatars. For example, when a customer inquires about upgrading their internet package, an on-screen avatar can simulate a human interaction, guiding them through their options and next steps for executing the upgrade. It could also be used for retail experiences, travel, or even for employees to better understand and be guided through work policies and software capabilities.\nThe avatar demo showcased at Knowledge was powered by NVIDIA ACE\u2014a suite of technologies that enable lifelike and engaging digital avatars for customer service and more. In the proof of concept, NVIDIA ACE connected to Now Assist via the Now Platform to power the avatars. ACE includes NVIDIA Riva multilingual automatic speech recognition and language translation to understand human speech, NVIDIA Audio2Face for facial animation and lip syncing, and NVIDIA Omniverse Renderer for physically based ray-traced rendering to bring life-like visuals to the avatars. ServiceNow ran the capabilities on NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure, which includes the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform for production grade, secure, and reliable AI software.\nThe Now Assist avatar demo builds on the ServiceNow and NVIDIA collaboration to drive GenAI\u2011powered industry innovations. This includes powering AI research and ServiceNow AI model development with NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, NVIDIA H100, and A100 Tensor Core GPUs for intelligent workflows; Now Assist for Telecommunications Service Management (TSM); as well as collaborations with Hugging Face and the Big Code Community on StarCoder2, a family of open\u2011access LLMs for code generation that sets new standards for performance, transparency, and cost\u2011effectiveness. NVIDIA also uses ServiceNow Now Assist to streamline its IT operations and improve the employee experience with conversational capabilities, empowering employees with self-service. Earlier this year, ServiceNow became one of the first platform providers to access NVIDIA NIM, enabling faster, scalable, and more cost\u2011effective LLM development and deployment for customers.\nNow Assist\u2014ServiceNow\u2019s GenAI experience\u2014puts AI to work for people across the Now Platform, connecting formerly siloed departments, people, data, and processes, all on the single secure, trusted AI platform for business transformation. Now Assist is embedded across the Now Platform and ServiceNow workflows to deliver intelligent self-service for employees and customers, boost productivity for agents and developers, and help give customers actionable insights for an even faster path to success. Many of ServiceNow\u2019s Now Assist features are powered by a Now AI multimodal model that is fast, cost effective, and secure, powering the best possible GenAI solutions for the ServiceNow platform.\nAs Now Assist continues to transform how we work, ServiceNow is committed to charting the future of impactful, responsible, and secure AI\u2014embracing open-science, open-governance development. ServiceNow is a founding member of the AI Alliance led by IBM and Meta, to join forces with other pioneering organizations in advancing the principles of open, safe, and responsible AI globally.\nAdditional Information\nWatch the avatar demo during the Knowledge 24 keynote address, where Desai will be joined by Huang.\nCheck out the press release on ServiceNow\u2019s latest Now Assist generative AI solutions, announced at Knowledge 24.\n*Gartner, Emerging Tech: Multimodal Generative AI Interfaces Transform User Experiences, December 2023.

        "Title": "Better AI Stock: Nvidia vs. Snowflake",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) represent two different ways to invest in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market. Nvidia is the world's largest producer of discrete GPUs, which are used to render high-end graphics and process AI tasks. Snowflake's cloud-based data warehouses store and clean up large amounts of data so it can be easily accessed by third-party applications. That process makes it easier for AI applications to make data-driven decisions.\nNvidia and Snowflake both recently headed in opposite directions after their latest earnings reports. Nvidia's stock soared to a new all-time high after the company crushed Wall Street's top- and bottom-line expectations, provided a rosy outlook, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Snowflake's stock slumped after the company missed analysts' bottom-line estimates and provided a murky near-term outlook. So should investors continue to buy Nvidia and avoid Snowflake?\nNvidia's revenue growth flatlined in fiscal 2023, which ended in January of that year,\u00a0as its adjusted EPS dropped 25%. That slowdown was caused by the PC market's post-pandemic slump and macro headwinds for the data center market. At the time, most analysts expected Nvidia to post a modest recovery the following year.\nBut in fiscal 2024, Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS soared 126% and 288%, respectively. That growth was entirely driven by its sales of data center GPUs for AI applications. The soaring popularity of generative AI platforms such as OpenAI's ChatGPT caused the market's demand to outstrip its available supply, and Nvidia's gross margin grew as it exercised its pricing power.\nMetric\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ4 2024\nQ1 2025\nRevenue growth (YOY)\n(13%)\n101%\n206%\n265%\n262%\nAdjusted gross margin\n66.8%\n71.2%\n75%\n76.7%\n78.9%\nData source: Nvidia. YOY = Year-over-year.\nNvidia generated 87% of its revenue from its data center chips in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, and that business is growing like a weed as the AI market expands. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 80% and 90%, respectively, for the full year -- but it still looks reasonably valued relative to those growth rates at 41 times forward earnings.\nNvidia could eventually face tougher competition from Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) cheaper data center GPUs, first-party chips from its top customers, and other types of AI accelerator chips. But for now, it's still selling the best shovels for the AI gold rush -- and it could have plenty of room to run before this growth cycle peaks.\nSnowflake's product revenue, which accounts for most of its top line, surged 70% in fiscal 2023, which ended in January of that year. But its net revenue retention rate, which gauges its year-over-year growth per customer, fell from 178% to 158%.\nIn fiscal 2024, its product revenue only rose 38% as its net revenue retention rate declined to 131%. Over the past year, its top-line growth stabilized but its retention rates kept slipping. That's worrisome because Snowflake only charges usage-based fees instead of locking its customers into stickier recurring subscriptions.\nMetric\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ4 2024\nQ1 2025\nProduct revenue growth (YOY)\n50%\n37%\n34%\n33%\n34%\nNet revenue retention rate\n151%\n142%\n135%\n131%\n128%\nAdjusted product gross margin\n77%\n78%\n78%\n78%\n77%\nData source: Snowflake. YOY = Year over year.\nSnowflake mainly blamed that slowdown on the macro headwinds, which forced many companies to rein in their software spending, but it also faces plenty of competition from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud -- which all integrate their own data warehouse services into their own cloud platforms. However, its stable gross margin suggests it still has plenty of pricing power in its niche market.\nUnfortunately, Snowflake expects its product revenue growth to decelerate in the second quarter, and analysts expect its total revenue to increase only 24% for the full year as its adjusted EPS declines 26%. That deceleration indicates its hypergrowth days are over, but its stock still trades at about 285 times forward earnings and 15 times this year's sales. Those frothy valuations could limit its upside potential even if it stabilizes its core business.\nIt's easy to see why investors flocked to Nvidia and shunned Snowflake over the past year. Nvidia's core business is firing on all cylinders and its stock looks reasonably valued, but Snowflake's revenue growth is cooling off and it's struggling to support its premium valuations. So unless the AI market abruptly cools off, I believe Nvidia will continue to outperform Snowflake.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Nicholas Rossolillo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After toying for years with various digital advertising software stocks, I've finally landed on one I think is a winner: AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP). Nvidia may have (quite rightfully) captured the spotlight on Wall Street and catapulted itself into a spot among the largest companies in the world, but the GPU maker isn't the only business winning from the artificial intelligence (AI) race.\nUnlike some of the other businesses that like to flaunt their AI credentials, AppLovin has been delivering some incredible financial results. If it can keep the pedal to the metal, the more than 250% rally its stock enjoyed over the past year might be just the beginning.\nAppLovin provides an AI-powered digital ad platform for app publishers that targets potential users in hopes of convincing them to download their apps. Its latest iteration, which it launched in early 2023, is called Axon 2.0.\nSuffice it to say the AI algorithms in Axon 2.0 are on fire. Revenue from AppLovin's \"software platform\" segment, which houses the AI ad platform, soared by 91% year over year in Q1 2024 to $678 million. That contributed to a total revenue increase of 48% to $1.06 billion.\nThe other $380 million in sales came from its \"apps\" segment (up only 5% year over year), a collection of mobile game studios and developers. AppLovin's game studios are among Axon 2.0's customers, and why not, given the ad platform's success?\nSo what exactly makes Axon 2.0 AI so good at landing app downloads for mobile marketers? It's a mystery to the outside world. The algorithms of digital ad platforms are often referred to as \"black boxes.\" The inner workings of their ad placement software are intentionally kept secret to prevent them from being copied by rivals in the fiercely competitive industry.\nThe methodologies of Axon 2.0 are similarly tightly held secrets, but clearly, marketers don't care. If using AppLovin's services means more mobile users are hitting the download button, and they are getting good return on investment from their ad campaigns, they're happy to keep shoveling portions of their ad budgets toward it.\nThere's always the risk that the wild marketing and ad landscape could shift: Some peer could come up with a better AI-powered black box, and AppLovin might lose its mojo.\nBut the other reason the stock has rocketed higher in the last year is the company's profitability. AppLovin has gone from paltry profit generator to cash-gushing machine. And management (which includes co-founder Adam Foroughi as CEO) has been using much of that cash for stock buybacks. It repurchased another $752 million worth of stock (about 2.7% of the total market cap) in the first quarter alone.\nAppLovin is also making investments to help ensure it has a steady flow of users. In April, it invested $50 million in an app-based e-commerce and ad marketplace start-up called Flip, landing a new user for Axon 2.0 in the process. Perhaps similar investments can attract more customers to Axon 2.0 and keep the party rolling. There's no telling how long AppLovin's wild run will last.\nI've had a position in demand-side digital ad sales platform operator The Trade Desk\u00a0for years, but that stock has been moving sideways for some time due to its elevated valuation.\nAppLovin trades at a premium too -- 50 times its trailing 12-month earnings. But given management's outlook for continued growth, the stock only trades for 16 times expected 2024 earnings. That relatively low sticker price is in part due to its not-so-great balance sheet, as management has been peeling off cash to make those stock repurchases in recent quarters. At the end of March, AppLovin had just $436 million in cash and equivalents on the books, but $3.49 billion in long-term debt.\nI recently opened a position in AppLovin as it seems to be assuaging investors' clamor for more profits, and fast. The Trade Desk is still my top holding in digital ad software, and I'll continue to hold both stocks, but I'll certainly be watching to see how the AI story at AppLovin plays out this year.\nBefore you buy stock in AppLovin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and AppLovin wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The work will help advance design capabilities for gene therapies and other sequence-based medicines with potential for transformative patient impact\nThe collaboration will focus on scaling Dyno\u2019s pioneering \"lab-in-the-loop\" sequence design approach using NVIDIA\u2019s optimized cloud and BioNeMo platforms\nWATERTOWN, Mass., May 09, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dyno Therapeutics today announced a collaboration with NVIDIA to leverage Dyno\u2019s field-leading artificial intelligence (AI) and in vivo experimentation capabilities, along with the built-to-scale NVIDIA BioNeMo AI-powered drug design platform, to help advance biological sequence design.\nEverything life does is controlled by biological sequences: DNA, RNA, and proteins. The capacity to design these sequences can drastically improve outcomes in healthcare and technology. Over the past decade, Dyno has pioneered an AI-powered approach to sequence design, creating some of the first in vivo-validated biologics using generative AI. Recently, Dyno\u2019s proprietary generative AI methods yielded optimized capsid products that allow enhanced in vivo delivery of genetic therapies for Dyno\u2019s partners, including the Dyno eCap\u2122 1 capsid in the eye and the Dyno bCap\u2122 1 capsid in the brain. Both have been validated through in vivo studies. Sequence-design algorithms become much more powerful when trained with appropriately large and diverse data sets and sufficiently fast and versatile computational resources. Dyno believes transformative sequence design capabilities can be brought within reach using its extensive proprietary datasets and the scale NVIDIA\u2019s compute platform enables.\nDyno relies heavily on NVIDIA accelerated computing for its inference and design pipelines. NVIDIA will support the collaboration through its cloud infrastructure, software and the NVIDIA BioNeMo framework. These will enable Dyno to research and deploy advanced machine-learning models at a higher velocity for sequence design. Dyno\u2019s machine learning scientists and engineers will work with NVIDIA AI experts to scale, enhance, and optimize Dyno's AI-powered inference and search algorithms, serving them through NVIDIA NIM microservices and BioNeMo, both part of NVIDIA AI Enterprise.\n\"For billions of years, Darwinian evolution has been the world\u2019s most powerful sequence design algorithm, but the resulting gene and genome sequences represent only a slim fraction of what we now know is possible to achieve. For decades, bioengineering progress has advanced primarily through mimicking this process in the lab. Dyno has demonstrated that a new route is possible by combining AI with high-throughput molecular experimentation in a self-reinforcing learning loop,\" said Eric Kelsic, Ph.D., founder and Chief Executive Officer of Dyno Therapeutics. \"Our work with NVIDIA will massively scale and improve this capability so that we can rapidly navigate sequence space at a pace matching revolutionary advances in modern computation, creating transformative medicines that help many more patients.\"\n\"One of the greatest impacts of generative AI is its ability to revolutionize life sciences and healthcare,\" said Rory Kelleher, Global Head of Business Development for Life Sciences at NVIDIA. \"NVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with Dyno will optimize and scale high-performance biological sequence design, helping to dramatically accelerate the pace of drug discovery and development.\"\nAll patients can potentially benefit from the ability to design therapies based on biological sequences. As the diversity of life vividly displays the breadth of the sequence-based biological design space, improved sequence-design capabilities have the potential to create myriad new medicines with vast potential for life-changing impact. For this reason, Dyno was founded to apply advanced sequence design technologies to solve therapeutic challenges. Dyno\u2019s team has been focused over the past decade on solving the challenge of in vivo delivery for genetic therapies by engineering optimized Adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid sequences, and in doing so became a world leader in machine-guided sequence design and generative AI. The collaboration is made possible as a result of the insights and learnings generated by the Dyno team, including billions of in vivo sequence-function data points measured across millions of distinct capsid sequences, and the computational revolution being catalyzed by NVIDIA platforms.\nDyno\u2019s team, accelerated by NVIDIA\u2019s full-stack accelerated computing and AI expertise, will develop and apply AI models across numerous research areas including multi-property capsid optimization and design of novel AAV serotypes, while also generalizing these capabilities to a broader range of therapeutically relevant molecules. Dyno\u2019s partners will benefit from the accelerated pace of Dyno\u2019s research and development of new capsid products, as well as from computational capabilities that Dyno may offer to pharmaceutical partners through NVIDIA\u2019s BioNeMo.\nAbout Dyno Therapeutics\nDyno Therapeutics is solving the in vivo gene delivery challenge while partnering with gene therapy developers to maximize patient impact.

        "Text": "By Chuck Mikolajczak\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks closed with slight gains on Tuesday, sending the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to record levels, as investors assessed the latest comments from Federal Reserve officials for clues on the timing of a rate cut while quarterly earnings from Nvidia drew closer.\nNvidia, Wall Street's third-largest firm by market capitalization, will report results after the closing bell on Wednesday in what is likely to be a significant market catalyst and will test whether the outsized rally in AI-related stocks can be sustained.\nNvidia's options are primed for an 8.7% swing, or $200 billion in market cap, in either direction by Friday, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert. The chipmaker's shares were up 0.64% on Tuesday and are up about 93% on the year, after surging nearly 240% in 2023.\nInvestors also looked toward minutes from the Fed's most recent policy meeting, due on Wednesday, after multiple Fed officials on Tuesday reinforced the stance that it would be best for the central bank to exercise patience before starting to cut interest rates.\n\"Investors are sort of just sitting on their hands for today because there are two important things that will be coming out tomorrow, Fed minutes combined with Nvidia earnings, so I don't think people want to make any big bets ahead of that,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York.\nHe said the Fed was \"still very much data-dependent and as a result, they're going to do what the data tells them to do and that's pretty much it, but Wall Street is going to continue to forecast, ourselves included, that the Fed will start to cut rates in September.\"\nMarkets are currently pricing in a 64.8% chance for a cut of at least 25 basis points at the central bank's September meeting, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 66.22 points, or 0.17%, to 39,872.99, the S&P 500 gained 13.28 points, or 0.25%, to 5,321.41 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 37.75 points, or 0.22%, to 16,832.62.\nThe Nasdaq notched its fourth record close in the past six sessions while the S&P closed at a record for the first time since May 15.\nThe S&P 500 traded in a range of about 27 points on the session.\nRetailers were 0.36% lower as a flurry of quarterly reports from the group signals the winding down of earnings season, with Lowe's shares ending lower after the home improvement company warned of operating-margin pressure in the current quarter.\nAutomotive parts retailer AutoZone declined 3.53% after a third-quarter sales miss.\nMacy's jumped 5.13% after the department store operator raised its annual profit forecast, despite posting a bigger-than-expected drop in sales for the first quarter.\nJPMorgan Chase rose 2.01%, recovering some of Monday's 4.5% drop, helping fuel a climb in the S&P 500 banks index.\nInternational Business Machines advanced 2.09% on plans to release a family of artificial-intelligence models as open-source software and help Saudi Arabia train an AI system in Arabic.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.07-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.35-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P 500 posted 54 new 52-week highs and six new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 133 new highs and 111 new lows.\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 11.39 billion shares, compared with the 11.87 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak in New YorkEditing by Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "This year already saw two new companies' market caps surpass $2 trillion, and a third is poised to hit that milestone.\nThe current members of the $2 trillion club are some of the most well-respected names in their fields, and all of their businesses revolve around technology.\nMicrosoft ($3 trillion) established itself as an AI leader with a smart investment in OpenAI. Its Azure cloud computing platform and enterprise software business reap the benefits.\nApple ($2.8 trillion) sells the iPhone and operates a growing services ecosystem built around its devices.\nNvidia ($2.2 trillion) sits at the forefront of the AI trend as a supplier of the most sought-after chips for large language model training.\nAlphabet ($2.1 trillion) owns the most popular search engine, Google, operating a massive advertising business, and one of the biggest cloud computing platforms in the market.\nThe next company likely to join them also heavily invested in tech, including cloud computing and digital advertising. But its core business, retail, also shows a ton of potential for earnings growth. That company is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\nThree important pieces of Amazon's business are benefiting from various trends. But investors shouldn't discount the operational excellence that Amazon's management team exhibited to take advantage of those trends.\nAmazon is a key player in the booming AI trend. As demand for generative AI capabilities expands, cloud computing segment Amazon Web Services (AWS) is building out its capabilities to meet that demand.\nCEO Andy Jassy says he likes to think of AI development in three layers. At the base layer, Amazon offers developers compute instances powered by Nvidia GPUs and its own custom Trainium 2 chips. It also offers a service, SageMaker, that makes training a large language model easier by managing customer training data. In the middle layer, it offers Amazon Bedrock for anyone looking to build on top of existing large language models. Developers can expand on existing models and build custom AI apps using Bedrock's tool set. At the top layer are existing AI-powered applications running on the cloud.\nAll three layers have contributed to the reacceleration of Amazon Web Services' revenue growth. The segment's revenue run rate surpassed $100 million in the first quarter.\nThe second trend is digital advertising. Despite how prevalent digital advertising is these days, it remains an opportunity for Amazon. The company saw great success with its sponsored product listings. In January, it started including video ads in Prime Video by default, adding another opportunity for sales growth. That said, management still says it thinks there are growth opportunities in its core display ad business.\nIts advertising revenue climbed 24% year over year last quarter, and exceeded $49 billion over the trailing 12 months.\nAmazon's original business, online retail, remains a big opportunity. Despite relatively slow growth for online store sales, third-party seller services, and subscription services (which mostly consists of Prime memberships), the real story is its expanding operating margin. North American operating margin climbed to 5.8% from 1.2% a year ago. That margin expansion was fueled by more efficient shipping operations as Amazon overhauled its logistics network. International operating income turned positive in the first quarter, a major milestone for the company.\nSmall improvements in operating margin go a long way when a business generates $500 billion per year in revenue.\nAs of this writing, Amazon's market cap sits just shy of $2 trillion. The stock needs to gain just 3% for the company to reach that milestone, and that could happen any day. Given the significant trends lifting its business and its operational successes, it shouldn't take long for the market to push it over the top.\nThat's especially true considering that the stock trades at a fair valuation. Its enterprise-value-to-sales ratio is 3.2, and analysts on average expect 11% sales growth both this year and next year. But with the expanding operating margin, it should produce earnings and free cash flow growth that far exceeds its revenue growth. And its price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of about 40 looks downright cheap compared to Amazon's historic levels.\nAt its current price, Amazon has an opportunity to surpass a $2 trillion valuation and never look back.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) The Top Quantum Computing Stock To Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled the list of the 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy according to the hedge funds using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) stands against the other quantum computing stocks.\nThese days, artificial intelligence is one of the hottest topics on the stock market and the media. This is because of the improvements in data analysis and decision making offered by AI models. These have augmented pre AI data analysis and text production technologies, and consequently, Wall Street has piled billions of dollars into the industry.\nAs AI is to data science, quantum computing is to classical computing. Or at least in some aspects. The fundamental difference between a classical and quantum computer is physics. Classical computers operate under the principles of classic physics, which means that it is easy to determine whether a semiconductor's processor is in the on (1) or off (0) state. In quantum computing's case, a transistor's equivalent is an elemental particle capable of existing in multiple states. So, a quantum 'transistor' could be on and off at the same time, to provide programmers with more flexibility to solve problems.\nThis ability to process more inputs means that quantum computing offers complex problems that traditional computers might not have enough capacity for. This is one reason that some estimates expect the quantum computing industry to be worth a modest $11.4 billion by 2027 despite a rapid compounded annual growth rate of 33%.\nAt the same time, quantum computing stocks are riskier than even traditional and typically high growth companies. This is because their products do not have sizeable markets and require considerable investment and research and development expenditure which might even take longer to recover than for biotechnology stocks.\nThese facts also make it trickier to analyze quantum computing stock performance since there are considerably fewer publicly traded companies to offer the convenience of simply seeing how an exchange traded fund has performed. For instance, consider the holdings of the Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM). Some of its top holdings include software firm MicroStrategy and the memory manufacturer Micron. Neither of these companies generates material income from making products that are essential for a quantum computer to perform. Another major holding is NVIDIA Corporation, and while it does make a product for a quantum processing unit's (QPU) quantum controller, most, if not all of its share price gains have been due to artificial intelligence.\nThis means that we need to analyze individual quantum computing stocks to see how they have performed recently. Heading into the year's second half, investors have battled with high inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical tensions, turmoil in banking, and euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence since 2022.\nSome quantum computing stocks that are commonly known are Rigetti Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ:RGTI),\u00a0 IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ), and D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE:QBTS). Over the past five years, their shares have lost 89%, 24%, and 89%, respectively. Mind you though, this doesn't mean that quantum computing stocks never go up. For instance, take the example of IonQ. The firm listed its shares for trading in October after a merger, and between October 8th and November 19th, the stock soared by a whopping 233%. For comparison, Wall Street's AI darling NVIDIA's shares have gained 239% over the past twelve months.\nSo, the next question to ask is, what happened to this quantum computing stock? Well, part of the reason is a Goldman Sachs investment note that was released in November 2022. The note wondered when businesses would start adopting quantum computing into their operations, and whether the company's technology roadmap could align with this shift, as uncertainty persisted over \"which forms of quantum computer ultimately captures market share,\" according to analyst Toshiya Hari. After losing 14% in the wake of Hari's comments, the stock would proceed to bottom out over the new year in January, but its performance graph changes when we zoom into 2024's performance. April 2024 seems to have been the month for IonQ's shares as the stock is up by 17% since the 19th.\nPhoto by Javier Esteban on Unsplash\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the best quantum computing stocks, we first made a list of pure play quantum computing companies and those that make crucial products for the industry.\u00a0 These stocks were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had held shares according to the last round of 13F filings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 186\nWall Street's artificial intelligence darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also an important quantum computing company. Its Hopper Superchip is the only GPU in the world that is marketed to work with a quantum computer, and in May 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw Hopper and NVIDIA's CUDA-Q software complement make inroads into several global quantum supercomputers.\nBy the end of this year's first quarter, out of all the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 186 had owned stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). One of the biggest stakeholders is Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners as it owns 13.3 million shares that are worth $12 billion.\nAs a result, NVDA ranks second among the 12 best quantum computing stocks to buy now. You can visit 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy to see the other quantum computing stocks that are on the hedge fund radar. NVDA is now a $2.75 trillion company and trades at a forward PE of 41. Assuming that its extremely high growth rate continues for a few more quarters, this isn't an expensive stock. This is a big assumption though. The market is assuming that NVDA can earn $70 billion over the next 12 months, $100 billion in 2 years, $150 billion in 3 years, and then grow those profits at high single digits for the foreseeable future (the same rate S&P 500 companies grow their earnings annually). I think the probability of this happening is less than 50% as NVDA needs to defend its moat for a couple of decades which is a very long time in the tech industry. Intel couldn't defend its moat for two decades and now trades at less than NVDA's 2026 expected earnings.

        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) climbed higher after the chip giant once again reported stellar earnings results. The stock has now more than tripled over the past year. The company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split effective June 7.\nLet's look at the company's latest quarterly results, one potential risk, its current valuation, and whether it's too late to buy the stock.\nNvidia once again saw explosive revenue growth when it reported its fiscal first-quarter results, with sales surging 262% year over year to $26.0 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $5.98, up 629%.\nIts data center business led the way with revenue soaring 427% to $22.6 billion. The company credited the strong growth to the huge demand for its Hopper GPU computing platform, which includes its H100 and H200.\nMoving forward, the company sees its H200 GPUs (graphic processing units) and next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture leading the way. It said the H200 is currently in production, with shipments on track for the second quarter, noting that the new chip nearly doubles the inference performance of its H100 chip. Meanwhile, Blackwell chips are expected to begin shipment in Q2 and ramp up in Q3.\nNvidia said that demand for both H200 and Blackwell both currently outstrip supply. It noted that Blackwell is backward compatible with its Hopper architecture, so it sees an easy transition for customers to go from H100 to H200 to B100 chips (based on its new Blackwell architecture). Given the current supply situation for its newer chip, demand for the H100 chip is increasing as well.\nOn its earnings call, Nvidia management was asked about the biggest potential risk facing the company, and that is customers over-ordering and pulling forward demand due to factors such as tight supplies. This is what ultimately derailed Cisco stock during the internet boom and subsequent bust.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company is racing every day to keep up with demand due to artificial intelligence (AI) applications from ChatGPT, GPT-40, Gemini, and Anthropic. He noted that there are also between 15,000 to 20,000 AI start-ups in various fields that need to train their end-to-end models, which is also driving demand.\nLonger-term, Huang said that there is a platform shift and that Nvidia is helping redesign how computers work. Instead of computers being used to take instructions and retrieve prerecorded files, they will be able to understand, reason, and give contextually relevant intelligent answers. This will change computing stacks around the globe.\nWhile there is a risk that there has been a pull-forward of demand, right now there is no indication that this is happening, although it is something to be mindful of going forward. If AI continues to advance the way Nvidia envisions it, the company could still be in the earlier phases of growth.\nDespite the stock's strong performance, Nvidia still trades at an attractive valuation of under 38 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). While growth will inevitably slow, this is still an inexpensive valuation for the growth potential the company still has.\nRight now, Nvidia is selling as many GPUs as its manufacturing partners can produce, and the only thing keeping it from selling more is capacity constraints. As such, the company should see solid growth from increases in capacity as well as from the move from Hopper to Blackwell, as chips designed with its newest GPU architecture are expected to be more expensive.\nThe combination of insatiable demand for its products, the long-term outlook for AI data center infrastructure, and a relatively inexpensive valuation continues to make Nvidia a buy. As such, even after its latest run, it's not too late for investors to buy the stock of the company that is helping to lead the AI revolution.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

On Mar 14, the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), recorded an all-time high of 73,750.07. However, it has fallen nearly 15% thereafter. Bitcoin gained more than 67% in first-quarter 2024 after jumping 157% in 2023.\nOne of the major reasons behind the decline in Bitcoin price was the halving event, which took place last month. The Bitcoin halving event happens once in four years. Moreover, U.S. equity markets tumbled in April owing to market participants\u2019 concern that the Fed will keep the interest rate higher for longer in light of the sticky inflation rate and a resilient labor market. A higher interest rate is detrimental to high-growth sectors like technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrency.\nNevertheless, with the April Bitcoin halving event now concluded, there is widespread speculation that the reduction in the supply of Bitcoins will result in a scarcity-driven price increase for the digital asset in the upcoming months.\nMiners who validate and record transactions receive rewards from the Bitcoin network and transaction fees. Halving reduces the block reward by half, aiming to cap Bitcoin's global circulation at 21 million. Consequently, demand for new Bitcoins increases, driving up prices.\nMeanwhile, Wall Street rebounded in early May following a sharp decline in the April job additions, a notable deterioration of the U.S. GDP growth rate in first-quarter 2024, the contraction of manufacturing and services PMI in April and less-than-hawkish statement by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell after the May FOMC meeting. Consequently, investors\u2019 expectations for the number of interest rate cuts in 2024 rose.\nSeveral research firms have said that this is just the beginning of the Bitcoin rally. Standard Chartered expects Bitcoin to reach $100,000 by the end of 2024. Research firm Fundstrat has provided a target range of $116,000 to $137,000 for this year. Hedge fund SkyBridge predicts Bitcoin to touch $170,000 by April 2025.\nFurthermore, VanEck estimated a medium-term target of $350,000 for Bitcoin. Connors' firm has estimated that the base case Bitcoin will reach $110,000 in 2024 and $140,000 next year. However, according to the firm\u2019s best-case scenario, the cryptocurrency will hit $180,000 in 2024 and $450,000 in 2025.\nWe have narrowed our search to five bitcoin-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024.

        "Title": "With Nvidia Competition Looming, Is This Top Data Center Stock Still a Buy?",
        "Author": "  Nicholas Rossolillo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shareholders of data center networking design and software provider Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET) got another helping of worry recently, this time delivered by none other than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nArista manages a formidable little data center empire based on Ethernet networking technology, the same wired tech you're likely using to plug your PC into your internet modem. But in April, several Wall Street analysts downgraded their outlook for Arista on news of potential new competition from Nvidia. That worry rose another notch on May 22 when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told analysts on the company's earnings conference call that his company is \"all in on Ethernet.\"\nDespite the heightened worries (and the trading volatility they created), Arista stock is still up nearly 30% so far in 2024, and it has more than doubled in price in the last year.\nIs it still a good buy now?\nSetting aside Nvidia's epic financial performance, let's judge Arista on its own merit. Because really, this company has hit its stride and is sustaining its fast pace.\nFirst-quarter revenue was up 16% year over year to $1.57 billion. Management expects at least an 11% year-over-year revenue increase in the second quarter. What's remarkable about that is that it builds atop a 34% full-year revenue increase in 2023 and 49% in full-year 2022. Suffice it to say Arista is benefiting from the current data center construction boom.\nEven better than revenue, though, earnings per share (EPS) according to generally accepted accounting principles were up 48% year over year in the first quarter. Free cash flow (FCF) was up 37% to $505 million for a healthy FCF profit margin of 32%.\nNvidia doesn't just make data center GPUs for artificial intelligence (AI). One of the key ingredients to its current success is its networking hardware, which it acquired in a merger with Mellanox in early 2020. Besides InfiniBand networking technology that has helped ease the adoption of the latest and greatest AI hardware, Nvidia acquired some Ethernet-based tech, too, with Mellanox.\nAnd it's Nvidia's recent lean into Ethernet that has the market a bit jittery. The company's Spectrum-X Ethernet platform looks to build on its early success with InfiniBand\u00a0and is a more direct competitor to what Arista offers its data center customers. Arista ranks \"cloud titans\" Microsoft, Meta Platforms, big financial institutions, and other large enterprises as its top customers.\nTwo counterpoints to this worry about a looming Nvidia: 1. Arista says its customers' spending is healthy, especially among \"cloud titans\" as they continue to expand global cloud-network coverage, and 2. It is working on its own Ethernet-based AI networking tech to counter Nvidia.\nLast summer, Arista and others -- including chip design giant Broadcom -- announced the Ultra Ethernet Consortium to advance Ethernet technology for the new era of AI. It might take a couple of years for the payoff from this work to be fully realized, but it's obvious from Arista's recent financial performance that it still is very much engaged with its customers on networking infrastructure build-out.\nThe real risk can't simply be boiled down to an Nvidia problem. Competition has been, and is always going to be, the name of the game in this networking and cloud infrastructure arena. Arista will be just fine. But is the stock a buy? At 38 times expected full-year 2024 EPS, shares do trade for a premium after the big rally in the last year.\nJust as I wrote last month, some patience with Arista stock could be rewarded as the market digests recent news and the company's own rapid advance. I can't call it a best-buy candidate now, but I'm certainly more than happy to continue holding my position for the long term. Investors who want in on the action might want to consider building a position gradually, perhaps using a quarterly dollar-cost averaging plan over time to buy this leader in cloud computing.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares are on fire -- but this isn't a short-term phenomenon. The chip designer's stock has been on the rise for a few years. It took off in 2020, and since that time, it's soared more than 1,600%.\nInvestors have piled into the stock on optimism about the company's position in artificial intelligence (AI), a market forecast to grow in the double digits to more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. Today, Nvidia is the world's AI chip leader, with a market share of more than 80%. But that isn't the only reason investors are excited about the stock. One favorable trend explains why Nvidia shares have become unstoppable.\nFirst, it's important to note that Nvidia's data center business includes all of the revenue it makes through its AI products and services. Rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Intel also have data center businesses and have been ramping up their offerings to compete with Nvidia.\nHere's the favorable trend that's boosted the company's stock. As shown in the chart below, Nvidia's data center revenue has climbed -- and actually roared higher as of early last year -- while the data center revenue of rivals has lagged behind. Intel's data center revenue actually has declined from earlier levels.\nInvestors like this trend of growth because it gives them confidence that Nvidia is staying ahead of its rivals. The idea that the company has what it takes to keep the increasing revenue trend going will keep the positive share price momentum. The tech giant has pledged to continue innovation to make that happen, and it's set for what may be its biggest launch yet: The release later this year of its Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever.\nIn addition to Nvidia's AI chips, the company sells entire platforms to help customers launch their AI programs, so the revenue opportunity is broad. All of this means Nvidia's explosive growth may be far from over, and this could equal significant gains for the stock over the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+87.0% vs. +44.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific.

Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 150 million monthly actives.Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world.

The company is a reliable player in the energy sector, boasts a resilient capital structure and a track record of prudent capex management. Its strategic discoveries in the Stabroek Block and Permian Basin promise growth and lower greenhouse gas intensity.With a robust balance sheet, ExxonMobil prioritizes shareholder returns, evidenced by substantial buybacks and the strategic acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. The company aims to increase its annual share buybacks to $20 billion through 2025.However, challenges loom, notably in the upstream operations, which are susceptible to volatile oil prices and regulatory hurdles. While committed to shareholders, ExxonMobil faces scrutiny for lagging industry peers in terms of dividend yield. Reliance on finding economically recoverable reserves and exposure to OPEC production cuts add to uncertainties.(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)Shares of HF Foods have underperformed the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (-4.9% vs. -3.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $165.72 million is facing challenges which includes high debt levels, low net profit margins, declining cash flow, and inventory management issues. Dependence on the Asian restaurant market, exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and geopolitical risks pose concerns.The impact of exiting the chicken processing business and the risks associated with transformation initiatives persist. Nevertheless, HF Foods\u2019 revenues increased 0.6% year over year in first-quarter 2024 despite exiting its chicken processing business in 2023.Profitability improved significantly, with net loss narrowing and adjusted EBITDA increasing. Cost control measures, such as centralized purchasing, fleet enhancements, and digital transformation, are driving efficiencies. With a strong liquidity position, HF Foods is well-positioned for strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to expand its footprint.(You can read the full research report on HF Foods here >>>)Blue Dolphin Energy\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry over the past year (+104.9% vs. +17.8%).

Moreover, persistent debt issues, significant default amounts, and concerns over affiliate transactions further cloud its financial stability.(You can read the full research report on Blue Dolphin Energy here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today Philip Morris International Inc.

        "Title": "Top-ranked analyst declares JPMorgan \u2018the Nvidia of banking\u2019 after it spends $17 billion on tech in a single year",
        "Author": "  Amanda Gerut ",
        "Text": "Amid the sea of numbers that surfaced at JPMorgan Chase\u2019s investor day, the one that stood out to a top-read analyst is this: $17 billion.\nThat\u2019s the total investment the $562 billion financial firm is going to spend on technology this year, noted large-cap bank analyst Mike Mayo. \u201cThat\u2019s a record\u2014no bank has ever spent $17 billion on tech in one year,\u201d Mayo told CNBC on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s equal to the total expenses\u2026for the eight largest banks and that\u2019s what JPMorgan spends on tech alone.\u201d\nMayo, a managing director at Wells Fargo Securities, has a penchant for speaking bluntly about banks and their leaders. Dimon has even admitted to reading his reports and enjoying their \u201cbanter.\u201d On Monday, Mayo said JPMorgan\u2019s investment in tech is turning JPMorgan into \u201cthe Nvidia of banking,\u201d and Dimon into a digital leader, even if the bank CEO hasn\u2019t \u201cinternalized\u201d that information yet.\n\u201cThey\u2019re spending it on AI; they\u2019re spending it on digital banking; they\u2019re modernizing the back office; they\u2019re trying to be the preeminent digital bank 2.0, which is the next version of banking,\u201d said Mayo. That next iteration involves creating new products, services, relationships, and engagements that were previously unavailable in analog form, he said. \u201cJPMorgan is at the forefront of being that digital leader,\u201d he added.\nThe bank, which holds $5 trillion in client assets and employs 310,000 people, said Monday it will allocate the tech investment across its businesses and strategy. About $4.5 billion will fund products and user experiences, and $3.1 billion will go to modernization, security, and software development. The remainder will be spread across its wealth management, community, and commercial and investment banking businesses.\nOne thing JPM isn\u2019t doing, noted Mayo, is buying back stock. JPMorgan shares hit a high of $205 on Monday, before dropping back to $196. According to Dimon, buying back stock at that price \u201cis a mistake.\u201d\nOn Dimon\u2019s buyback stance, Mayo believes the CEO is borrowing a phrase from legendary investor Warren Buffett: \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.\u201d\nMayo said Dimon has a \u201chealthy paranoia\u201d as the CEO of a global bank because anything can hit the company. On the other hand, it\u2019s frustrating for investors if JPMorgan doesn\u2019t buy back stock at the current price while Dimon is selling stock for the first time in his career. In February and April, Dimon cashed out 1 million shares of JPMorgan stock, with the total proceeds valued at about $183 million. The sales were the first two in the CEO\u2019s 19-year history at the bank, and he announced them in advance.\nOverall, Dimon\u2019s remarks and JPMorgan\u2019s investor-day materials overall were bullish for one of Mayo\u2019s favorite stocks, Citigroup. He quipped that Citigroup\u2019s CEO might want to be grateful for Dimon\u2019s stance.\n\u201cJane Fraser should send a thank-you note to Jamie Dimon saying, \u2018Thank you because your theme supports our stock.\u2019\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Here's My Favorite Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock, and It's Not Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has skyrocketed over the last year, attracting businesses and consumers from dozens of industries. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reinvigorated the AI market and forced the public to rethink what was currently possible with the generative technology.\nIn the last 12 months, the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index has risen 55%, with much of that growth owed to Nvidia. The chipmaker's business exploded alongside a boom in AI. Its stock has climbed 234% since last April as AI chip demand has increased, leading to soaring earnings for the company.\nAs a result, Nvidia has become a poster child of sorts for the rally in AI. However, with numerous companies joining the market, there are potentially better investment options and ways to back the budding industry.\nSo, here's why Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is my favorite AI stock right now, even over Nvidia.\nAlphabet is no stranger to AI, with CEO Sundar Pichai describing the company as seven years into its \"journey as an AI-first company.\" However, like many tech firms, Alphabet recently placed a stronger focus on the industry.\nSince last year, the company launched its most powerful AI model, Gemini, introduced a range of new AI tools on its cloud platform, Google Cloud, and began incorporating the technology into services across its product lineup.\nAlphabet posted its first quarter of 2024 earnings on April 25, leading its shares to jump 14% in the hours following. The company welcomed revenue gains of 15% year over year, outperforming estimates by nearly $2 billion.\nAlphabet's quarter beat on multiple fronts, with earnings per share hitting $1.89 against expectations of $1.51. Meanwhile, YouTube advertising revenue came in at more than $8 billion when analysts projected $7.7 billion.\nHowever, the most promising beat came from Alphabet's AI-focused Google Cloud segment, which posted revenue growth of 28% year over year to $9.6 billion. Wall Street had forecast $9.3 billion for Alphabet's cloud business.\nInvestors rallied over Alphabet's stock, with signs that the company is beginning to see a return on its investment in AI. Businesses worldwide are increasingly utilizing the Google company's generative AI tools and cloud infrastructure to boost efficiency in their operations.\nMoreover, Alphabet has multiple use cases of AI thanks to the vast user base it has built up with platforms like YouTube, Chrome, Android, and the many services under Google. The company likely has a bright future in AI, and you won't want to miss out.\nIn addition to excitement over its outlook in AI, Alphabet rallied investors this week with the surprise announcement of its first-ever dividend. The cash amount will be $0.20 per share, revealed alongside plans to repurchase up to an additional $70 billion in stock.\nThe dividend represents a vote of confidence from Alphabet's board of directors about the company's direction and financial future. Management clearly believes in the company's path and ability to continue paying dividends for the foreseeable future.\nMoreover, Alphabet's stock is one of the best bargains in AI. The charts above show that it has the lowest forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow out of some of the biggest names in the industry.\nForward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its estimated earnings per share, while price-to-free cash flow divides its market cap by its free cash flow. These are useful metrics for determining a stock's value as investors consider a company's financials. With both metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value.\nAnd in this case, Alphabet is one of the best-valued stocks in AI. With glowing earnings, an exciting outlook in AI, and a potent position in tech, Alphabet's stock is worth considering investing in right now before it's too late.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $537,692!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "Analysts on Wall Street project that Nvidia (NVDA) will announce quarterly earnings of $5.52 per share in its forthcoming report, representing an increase of 406.4% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $24.27 billion, increasing 237.5% from the same quarter last year.\nOver the past 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been adjusted upward by 0.9% to its current level. This demonstrates the covering analysts' collective reassessment of their initial projections during this period.\nPrior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.\nIn light of this perspective, let's dive into the average estimates of certain Nvidia metrics that are commonly tracked and forecasted by Wall Street analysts.\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Revenue- Gaming' should come in at $2.63 billion.

        "Author": "  Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution rolls on. True, some of the AI stock stars like Nvidia have taken a breather recently as they consolidated their monster gains.\nYet below the surface, it's clear: AI isn't going anywhere, and there is still money to be made in the sector for investors with the courage -- and willpower -- to buy and hold.\nHere are two AI stocks that I believe are flying under the radar.\nFirst up is CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). The company, one of the leading providers of AI-powered cybersecurity, continues to deliver impressive results. \nIn its most recent quarter (ended Jan. 31), the company reported $845 million in revenue, up 33% from a year earlier. Similarly, free cash flow increased to $283 million, rising 35% year over year.\u00a0Two factors are driving CrowdStrike's outstanding fundamentals. \nFirst, the world needs more (or at any rate, much-improved)\u00a0cybersecurity solutions. As countless crucial systems and data have become digitized, the profits from hacking have grown immense. \nNearly every month, dozens of cyberattacks -- some publicized, some not -- result in millions of dollars in damages. Consequently, organizations are eager to pay for the protection companies like CrowdStrike can provide.\nSecond, CrowdStrike differentiates itself from the pack by providing cutting-edge AI-powered cybersecurity that acts as a force multiplier. CEO George Kurtz put it this way last year when discussing how the company's latest generative-AI application, Charlotte AI, will help boost security and productivity for its clients:\nLast I checked, security folks are hard to find, they're expensive, and they're hard to keep. So how do you make them more productive? And how do you get to teach them new skills on the job? These are the things that Charlotte is focused on.\nThanks to its innovative products and the enormous growth of the cybersecurity market, CrowdStrike remains near the top of my AI stock watch list.\nFiverr International (NYSE: FVRR)\u00a0operates an online platform connecting freelancers with employers, might seem like an odd choice. After all, shouldn't the rise of AI eat away at the company's core business?\nYet if you dig down, it becomes clear that Fiverr's business model is not only resilient, but that the rise of AI is also opening up new opportunities for the company.\nConsider this: In its most recent earnings call (for the three months ended March 31), management said, \"We continue to see growth in our rapidly evolving AI services, including new services such as AI Avatar design and custom GPT applications, and currently have over 10,000 AI experts on our marketplace.\"\nIn short, the rapid growth of AI chatbots isn't killing the freelancer market; it's simply changing it. New AI-driven professions like prompt engineers and module developers are emerging, and Fiverr is quickly helping to connect employers and these freelancers with its platform.\nFinancially, the company remains early in its life cycle, meaning it is focused on revenue growth. Over the last 12 months, Fiverr generated $361 million in revenue, with quarterly sales growing 10% year over year. Analysts expect revenue to rise about 6% this year and 10% next year.\nThis isn't a stock for everyone. For one thing, the company isn't consistently profitable, making it a poor choice for value-seeking investors.\nAnd growth-focused investors would be wise to keep an eye on the stock. It's a good example of how technological advancements can open up unexpected growth opportunities for people, organizations, and stocks.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has\u00a0more than tripled\u00a0the market.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and CrowdStrike made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks\n*Stock Advisor returns as of May 13, 2024\nJake Lerch has positions in CrowdStrike and Nvidia.

        "Text": "NVIDIA's Q1 2024 financial results were announced on March 22, 2024. Jensen Huang, CEO and President of NVIDIA, spoke to investors, stating that \"the next industrial revolution has begun,\u201d when referring to the rapid increase in demand for AI infrastructure. Here's what investors can take away from the call, including details on the announcement of a 10:1 stock split and increasing dividends.\nStay up to date on the latest stock and economic news that may affect NVIDIA and the rest of your portfolio. Sign up for the Market Minute newsletter.\nNVIDIA reported a record revenue of $26 billion in Q1 2024, marking an 18% increase quarter over quarter and 262% year over year. This performance was largely driven by strong demand for their NVIDIA Hopper GPU platform across data centers, cloud providers and enterprise customers. GAAP gross margin came in at 78.4%, up 2.4 points quarter over quarter.\nData center revenue reached $22.6 billion, making for a 23% increase from Q4 2023 and 427% year-over-year growth. This segment\u2019s success is attributed to the widespread adoption of NVIDIA\u2019s technology in AI and high-performance computing applications. For LLMs, the main customers included OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, XAI, Mistral and more.\u00a0Several main customers of NVIDIA's upcoming Blackwell chip were noted during the earnings call, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Tesla and Oracle.\nNVIDIA expects the largest enterprise verticals to be in automotive this year, with opportunities in consumer internet companies as well. Demand from international governments is also expected to increase to the single digit billions of revenue in the upcoming year.\nGet the latest market news delivered right to your inbox, including news that affects NVIDIA. Sign up for the Market Minute Newsletter.\nWhile the overall financial performance was stellar, NVIDIA\u2019s gaming revenue experienced a decline, accounting for just a tenth of overall revenue. This is a significant change from previous years, where gaming revenue represented a much larger portion of the company\u2019s total sales.\nFollowing the earnings report, NVIDIA\u2019s stock price crossed the $1,000 threshold for the first time in after-hours trading, rising from a $949.50 close before the call on May 22, 2024. The stock reached over $1,050 in the day following the call. On this day, NVIDIA took the spot as the third most valuable company in the world with a market capitalization over $2.5 trillion.\nNVIDIA announced a 10-for-1 stock split on the Q1 earnings call. This split aims to make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors. This will be the sixth stock split in NVIDIA's history.\nThe split will take effect after the market closes on June 7, 2024. Each shareholder of record as of June 6, 2024, will receive nine additional shares of stock for each share they own after the market close on June 7, 2024. The stock will then begin trading on a split-adjusted basis at the market open on June 10, 2024.\nFor news that affects investors and the wider economy, sign up for the free Market Minute newsletter.\nIn addition to the stock split, NVIDIA also announced it is raising its quarterly cash dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share on a post-split basis.\nNVIDIA noted supply chain challenges and the impact of U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China. However, the company expressed optimism about its ability to navigate these challenges and continue serving its customers globally. Both Blackwell chips and H200s are said to both be supply-constrained for the foreseeable future.\nNVIDIA announced the Spectrum-X Ethernet networking solution designed specifically for AI applications. Deliveries for Blackwell chips are expected to begin in Q2 2024. The first H200 GPUs were delivered to OpenAI this quarter, with more deliveries expected in Q2.\nThe NVIDIA annual shareholder\u2019s meeting is scheduled for June 26, 2024 at 9am CT.

        "Title": "This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Has Outperformed Nvidia in 2024",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The booming demand for Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) artificial intelligence (AI) chips has sent shares of the chipmaker soaring in 2024. The stock has jumped an impressive 115% so far this year and that's not surprising considering the pace at which its revenue and earnings are increasing quarter after quarter. For instance, Nvidia's revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (for the three months ended April 28) increased by 262% from the year-ago period to $26 billion. Additionally, its adjusted earnings shot up a stunning 461% to $6.12 per share. Nvidia's guidance of $28 billion in revenue for the ongoing quarter, up from $13.5 billion in the year-ago period, indicates that its outstanding growth is here to stay.\nOne AI stock has upstaged Nvidia's recent phenomenal stock price performance: Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) (which is also known as Supermicro). Shares of the company are up 211% so far in 2024, nearly double the returns of Nvidia.\nLet's see why that has been the case and check if this tech stock is capable of delivering more upside.\nJust like Nvidia, Supermicro benefits greatly from the adoption of AI as this technology has accelerated the demand for its server solutions. Super Micro manufactures modular servers used for deploying the AI chips that Nvidia and its peers produce.\nThe company jumped ahead of bigger, more established rivals such as Dell Technologies in the production of AI servers by quickly churning out products designed specifically to incorporate popular AI graphics cards such as Nvidia's H100 and Nvidia's upcoming (and highly sought after) Blackwell processors. This explains why Supermicro's revenue and earnings increased at such a tremendous pace.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 31), Supermicro's revenue increased to $3.9 billion from $1.3 billion in the year-ago period -- tripling year over year. The company's non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased fourfold to $6.65 per share. The full-year revenue guidance of $14.9 billion is more than double Supermicro's fiscal 2023 top line of $7.1 billion, while the adjusted earnings guidance of $23.69 per share is also double the reading of $11.81 per share in the year-ago period.\nMore importantly, Supermicro could finish 2024 with a 23% share of the AI server market, according to KeyBanc analyst Thomas Blakey. The analyst points out that the company has built a solid competitive moat that could allow it to at least sustain -- if not gain -- its share of the AI server market in the long run.\nAccording to third-party estimates, sales of AI servers could jump from $40 billion in 2024 to $430 billion in 2033. Even if Supermicro manages to maintain a 20% share of this market in the long run, its top line will increase substantially over the next decade. However, it won't be surprising to see the company cornering a bigger share of the AI server market in the long run thanks to its focus on increasing its production capacity.\nThe KeyBanc analyst points out that Supermicro has a monthly production capacity of 5,000 server racks, and its capacity utilization stands at 60%. However, management pointed out earlier this year that its utilization rate is climbing quickly, which is why the company is looking to increase its production capacity by investing in new facilities.\nBlakey estimates that Supermicro's capacity expansion moves in Texas, Malaysia, and Mexico could help double its production capacity. This could pave the way for solid top-line growth at Supermicro and is probably the reason why analysts are expecting its revenue to almost double over the next couple of fiscal years.\nThe good thing for investors is that they can buy Supermicro stock at just 24 times forward earnings despite its 2024 rally. That forward earnings multiple is lower than the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 27 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). Even better, the stock's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) further shows that it is undervalued.\nThe PEG ratio helps us understand how expensive a stock is with respect to the growth that it is delivering. It is calculated by dividing a company's trailing earnings multiple by the potential earnings growth that it is expected to clock, and a reading below 1 means that a stock is undervalued.\nGiven that Supermicro's earnings are expected to clock a compound annual growth rate of over 60% for the next five years, investors are getting a good deal on this growth stock that has outperformed Nvidia this year, and they would do well to buy Super Micro Computer before it soars higher.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sanghamitra Saha ",
        "Text": "Ahead of NVIDIA's NVDA earnings release on Wednesday, traders are anticipating a significant movement in the company's shares, with lower volatility expectations compared to the previous quarters. Options data firm Trade Alert suggests an anticipated swing of 8.7% in either direction, translating to a potential $200 billion market cap shift, as quoted on Reuters.\nWhile the figure seems huge, this projected move falls short of past volatility, which included a 16.4% surge in NVIDIA\u2019s shares following the last earnings report. Notably, optimism surrounds NVIDIA as a key player in the AI industry, with its shares up about 97% this year (read: Should You Play NVIDIA Earnings with Bullish ETFs?).\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang recently highlighted the partnership with Dell Technologies as important for spreading AI capabilities across various industries. The collaboration aims to enable businesses and organizations establish their own \"AI factories,\" leveraging NVIDIA's technology alongside Dell's infrastructure solutions.\nDell is one of the largest providers of computing infrastructure to government agencies and businesses \u2014 a market that NVIDIA doesn\u2019t directly serve, per a Bloomberg article. NVIDIA\u2019s clientele mostly included other big techs like Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon.com AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL.\nNVIDIA now aims to integrate its technology into diverse sectors, from drug discovery to shipbuilding, as well as various agencies positioning itself as a leader in the AI space. For that, NVIDIA requires Dell\u2019s storage, networking and computing. While NVIDIA currently focuses on graphics chips for PCs, speculation is rife that the company may make an entry into producing central processing units.\nNVIDIA is expected to post massive earnings and revenue growth of 402.75% and 237.47%, respectively, for the to-be-reported quarter. NVIDIA has presented a solid earnings surprise history, as it delivered an earnings surprise of 20.18%, on average, in the last four quarters.\nAny downturn in NVIDIA's shares post earnings could put broader investor confidence in the overall AI trade to the test. Although the AI rally has been diversified, NVIDIA remains a defining factor for the near-term rally, and its performance could influence market sentiment toward AI-related investments.\nInvestors should note that BofA\u2019s strategists expect the company to drive 9% of the S&P 500 earnings growth over the next 12 months compared to 37% over the last 12 months, as quoted on Reuters.\nETFs having the largest allocation to NVIDIA could make compelling plays in light of its upcoming earnings as the basket approach minimizes the company-specific risks. These ETFs include Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, Grizzle Growth ETF DARP, TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF LRNZ and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ.\nInvestors should also note that NVIDIA\u2019s huge surge has drawn attention to single-stock ETFs that aim to double its daily return.TheGraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) and the T-Rex 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF (NVDX) will thus be under close watch pre and post earnings release. However, these instruments are suitable for short-term trading and are associated with high volatility.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The new server also offers liquid cooling technology, as opposed to air cooling, which tends to consume more power.\nArthur Lewis, president of the company's infrastructure solutions group, told Reuters in an interview that Dell's Nvidia-based servers were the fastest ramping product in its history.\nSpending on AI servers is expected to surpass $33 billion in 2024, according to research firm International Data Corporation (IDC).\nWith a significant amount of spending coming from relatively smaller companies that are still in the early stages of adopting new technologies, Lewis said Dell does not expect AI investments to significantly hit companies' expenditure on traditional servers.\nThis contrasts the wider market which has seen uncertain demand for traditional servers as enterprises prioritize spending on speedy AI servers.\nDell is going to report quarterly earnings on May 30, with analysts expecting both AI PCs and AI servers to help demand for the company's products.\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh and Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Shailesh Kuber)\n"

        "Title": "Beyond NVIDIA (NVDA): Hedge Funds are Buying This Utility Stock to Profit from the AI Boom",
        "Author": "  Fahad Saleem ",
        "Text": "We recently analyzed 8 best utilities stocks to buy to profit from the AI boom according to hedge funds. Since Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG) was part of the list, the stock deserves a deeper look. But first, let's see why everyone's taking about AI catalysts for utilities stocks these days.\nThe AI revolution that started with the launch of ChatGPT has catapulted several sectors into the limelight that were hitherto believed to be unrelated to AI. Utilities is one of the most notable of these sectors. As more and more companies deploy AI in their systems and develop new applications, they need high-performance data centers to power their AI processing chips. And these data centers are power hogs. Why? Goldman Sachs in a recent report titled AI, data centers and the coming US power demand surge said that a single ChatGPT query takes about 6 to 10 times as much electricity to process as a typical Google search. Goldman Sachs also expects AI-led data center boom to cause a 160% increase in power demand in the U.S. Goldman analysts estimate that utility companies will invest $50 billion to support this new demand from the data center sector.\nGoldman Sachs also expects data center power usage to more than double by 2030. It estimates that data centers would account for about 8% of the total power demand in the US, compared to just 3% in 2022. Goldman also expects power demand from AI to rise about 200 TWh in 2024-30, with the bull case estimate clocking in at 330 TWh, and the bear case estimate sitting at 110 TWh.\nA latest Bloomberg report cited Manju Naglapur, senior vice president and general manager for cloud, applications and infrastructure solutions at Unisys Corp, who said that data centers were causing a spike in power demand even before the latest AI boom. Naglapur thinks with the current scale of investments in data centers, power consumption will increase \"massively.\"\nAs investors begin to look beyond obvious AI mega-cap tech names like Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet, which have already racked up solid gains so far, utilities stocks are trending in the AI investing space. Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLU) is up about 11% so far this year. Kevin Gordon, a Director and Senior Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, recently said that 50% of the utilities sector constituents have seen their new 52-week highs. Utilities stocks come with an added allure thanks to their stable businesses and high dividend yields, something investors are looking for in the current economic environment where interest rates are expected to stay elevated.\nFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 919 hedge funds updated for the first quarter of 2024 and listed down all utilities stocks that are actively exposed to the AI power demand surge. From these stocks we chose 8 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nCarol Gauthier/Shutterstock.com\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 54\nEarlier this month, UBS published a list of stocks it believes would benefit from the AI boom as it expects global AI revenues to cross $400 billion in the next three years. Constellation Energy\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:CEG)\u00a0is among the stocks the firm is recommending investors to buy. Constellation Energy\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:CEG)\u00a0recently posted Q1 results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $1.82, beating estimates by $0.53. Revenue in the quarter fell 18.6% year over year to $6.16 billion, missing estimates by $20 million.\nConstellation Energy Corp's (NASDAQ:CEG) management was careful while talking about AI-led data center growth in its latest earnings call, adding that it's more interested in providing clean, nuclear energy to the interested companies. Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG) CEO Joseph Dominguez said during Q1 earnings call:\n\"I think the interest is like nothing else we\u2019ve seen in 20 years in terms of the number of clients that are coming to us, the size and scale of the opportunity. So I would say that, you know, kind of the, you know, what you\u2019re hearing in the market is certainly accurate in terms of the inbounds that we\u2019re getting from an origination team perspective. And frankly, some of the outreach we\u2019re doing. So that that all seems to be right. Right now it\u2019s focused on nuclear because the clients we\u2019re dealing with aren\u2019t interested, as a general rule, in emitting technologies. They have sustainability goals. They have 24/7 clean goals, and they want to stay on that path. So we\u2019re focused right now on the nuclear plant opportunity and monetizing the value of the attributes that we have.\"\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\nSound Shore Management made the following comment about Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\u201cOn the plus side of the ledger, we had strong contributions from independent power producers Vistra and\u00a0Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG). Both stocks surged with higher US electricity prices as strong summer demand exposed reliability issues in many regions of the nation\u2019s electric grid. Meanwhile, Midwest focused Constellation is the biggest producer of carbon-free electricity in the US with nuclear power plants representing the majority of its capacity. We added the name in January 2023 when the stock was trading at a below normal 15 times earnings. Our research identified an upside to earnings power from maturing hedges and regulatory changes, including the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s nuclear credit.

        "Text": "Insider Monkey recently analyzed billionaire Druckenmiller's latest Q1'2024 portfolio to see which AI stocks the billionaire was buying. NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is part of the 10 Best AI stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller. But the interesting question to answer is: Is NVIDIA really the best AI pick of Druckenmiller?\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 173\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 7th in Stanley Druckenmiller's Q1'2024 portfolio. If you want to take a look at the billionaire's top stock picks, click to see Druckenmiller's Family Office portfolio.\nAfter making huge profits on his NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0stake, which he bought in the fourth quarter of 2022, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller cut his stake in the AI chips company by 72% in the first quarter of 2024, a move that surprised many. Insider Monkey's data shows that Druckenmiller loaded up on 582,915 NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) shares during the fourth quarter of 2022 at an average price of $146.65 per share. Near the end of the first quarter of this year, NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0stock was hovering around $902 per share. Stanley Druckenmiller also liquidated his call options on NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0which he'd bought in the fourth quarter of 2023 for $242 million.\nDespite the massive bull run in NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0shares, Wall Street analysts are continuing to shower the stock with bullish ratings. UBS earlier this month published a list of stocks that are set to benefit from the massive surge in the AI industry, which the firm believes could touch $400 billion in revenue in the next three years. NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0was part of the list.\nNVDA: The Bull Case Based on Catalysts\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is continuing to refresh and update its AI chips product line as demand is skyrocketing. Analysts expect NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) H200 chips and Spectrum-X platform to offer cutting-edge processing and networking solutions for companies that are making generative AI software and applications. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) bulls believe that the company's growth catalysts are strong enough to justify its currently high valuation metrics. After all NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) still enjoys an 80% market share in the GPU industry, and its products are expected to see high demand in other industries, like automotive, gaming and mobile devices.\nNVDA's New Customer: Elon Musk\nNVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) \"real world\" AI segment is thriving. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently revealed that his company currently has 35,000 H100 chips. Tesla also can become the third-biggest NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) customer as the EV company plans to have 85,000 Nvidia H100 chips by the end of 2024 to train its AI models.\nHowever, some circles have voiced concerns on NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0valuation following the eye-popping stock price gains NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0has enjoyed over the past few months. This comes as major NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0customers like Meta Platforms,\u00a0Microsoft, Amazon and Google begin to mull producing AI chips in-house. NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is also outsourcing its production to Taiwan Semiconductor, which makes NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0vulnerable to any geopolitical risks especially when President Biden is upping the ante against China with new traffics and hawkish tone.\nWolfe Research in recently replaced Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) with its competitor AMD in its Alpha List. Wolfe Research cited NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0massive stock price gains year to date as a reason behind this move.\nHedge Fund Sentiment on NVDA\nInsider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds shows that 173 funds had stakes in NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA). Druckenmiller wasn't the only hedge fund manager who reduced his stake in NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0after enjoying massive stock price gains. Insider Monkey's data shows Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group, Donald Sussman's Paloma Partners and Paul Tudor Jones' Tudor Investment Corp decreased their stakes in NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0by more than 70% each in the first quarter of 2024.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThis quarter we entered two new positions, while exiting four positions.

        "Text": "Billionaire Steve Cohen is one of the few hedge fund managers who almost always dazzles with his outperformance and prescient bets. Cohen, who also owns The New York Mets, founded SAC Capital back in 1992, and since then through 2009 lost money only once. A Bloomberg report earlier this year said that Point72 Asset Management has been able to raise so much cash recently that it's starting to decline external money. The fund has reportedly raised about about $12.8 billion since 2020.\nPoint72's main fund returned about 11% in 2023, and 12% in the previous year.\nBillionaire Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management runs a highly diversified portfolio. As of the end of the March quarter, the portfolio's net worth was over $41.2 billion, with tech stocks accounting for 17% of the total portfolio.\nUnlike long-term value investors like Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman, Cohen moves with speed and adapts quickly. He's been like this for decades. When he was in Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, he would often skip classes to watch stock movements at a local brokerage. He took pride in predicting stock movements based on their direction.\nCohen, worth over $19 billion, is yet again adapting to the quickly changing global financial landscape as investors demand steady returns.

        "Text": "By Zaheer Kachwala\n(Reuters) - Nvidia's shares rallied around 6% to hit a record high on Tuesday, leaving the AI chipmaker's stock market value about $100 billion away from overtaking Apple in a major reshuffle of Wall street's biggest players.\nLast trading at $1,128, Nvidia's market capitalization reached $2.8 trillion, compared to a market value of $2.9 trillion for Apple, which is Wall Street's second-most valuable company after Microsoft.\nIts stock surged as much as 8% to $1,149.39 during the session, an intra-day record high. Apple's stock was down 0.2% in afternoon trading.\nNvidia's shares have surged nearly 13% since it forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations last week and announced a stock split, which excited investors as they continue to bet on the AI poster child.\n\"The market has been struggling to keep up with the company's ever improving growth trajectory. At a mid-thirties forward earnings multiple, this still doesn't feel like bubble territory,\" said Derren Nathan, head of equity analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown.\nNvidia recently traded at 36 times its forward profit estimates, compared with 38 for Advanced Micro Devices and 21 for Intel, according to LSEG data.\nThe company's shares have more than doubled so far this year after more than tripling last year.\nNvidia, which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, reported a five-fold jump in revenue at its data center segment last week as customers line up for their high-performance chips.\nAlphabet, Microsoft, Amazon.com and other technology companies have been competing for a limited supply of Nvidia's high-end chips as they race to dominate AI computing.\n\"Business is doing incredibly well, there are so many opportunities to keep growing, and the AI theme still has legs. When the song is that catchy, investors want to keep humming it all day long, said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell when asked about the stock's rally.\nLong considered a must-own stock on Wall Street, Apple has underperformed other Big Tech companies in recent months, falling around 2% this year as it struggles with weak iPhone demand and tough competition in China.\nMicrosoft overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company earlier this year as it raced ahead of other tech firms due to gains made by early investments in artificial intelligence across its cloud services.\nMicrosoft's shares were down 0.4% on Tuesday, giving it a market value of $3.1 trillion.\nApple has also been slower in rolling out generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts, than rivals such as Microsoft and Google, which are weaving them into products.\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala and Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n"

Revenues of $26.04 billion soared 262% year over year, marking the third straight quarter of growth in excess of 200%.\nThe metric also exceeded the consensus estimate of $24.33 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $6.12, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.49. This compares to earnings of $1.09 per share a year ago.\nThe company\u2019s data center revenues soared 427% year-over-year to $22.6 billion. Gaming revenues were up 18% year over year to $2.65 billion. Professional visualization revenues and automotive sales came in at $427 million and $329 million, respectively.\nThe AI market has gathered pace in the past few years buoyed by the rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet. These astonishing results were primarily due to sky-high shipments of NVIDIA\u2019s Hopper graphics processors, especially H100 GPU.\nMoreover, NVIDIA has given an impressive guidance even after three consecutive quarters of astonishing performances. Management expects sales of $28 billion in the fiscal second quarter, higher than the current consensus estimate of $26.6 billion.\nNVIDIA has also ensured that the artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy is yet to unfold. Consequently, several companies closely associated with NVIDIA, are likely to gain in the near future.\nWe have narrowed our search to five technology stocks that are closely associated with NVIDIA. These stocks have strong potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).\u00a0 You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

        "Author": "  Christiaan Hetzner ",
        "Text": "Nvidia\u2019s star founder Jensen Huang endorsed Tesla\u2019s strategy for AI-enabled autonomous vehicles weeks ahead of a key vote that determines if CEO Elon Musk receives his record compensation.\nMusk is all but betting the company on his recent pivot to AI, having quietly scuppered his vision of growing volumes more than tenfold to 20 million vehicles a year by 2030\u2014as much as Toyota and Volkswagen sell combined.\n\u201cTesla is far ahead in self-driving cars,\u201d Huang attested to in an interview with\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0uploaded\u00a0to YouTube late last week.\nThe AI pivot is controversial since it moves Tesla further away from its stated mission of accelerating the global transition to sustainable transportation. And while Musk\u2019s so-called \u201csupervised Full Self-Driving\u201d may be the best-known advanced driver assist system (ADAS) on the market, few customers saw the value of plunking down $15,000 for a system that would require them to babysit their car as it attempts to navigate city streets.\nAs a result, Musk's been forced to slash the price back down to $8,000, the level it was when he first launched FSD beta in October 2020.\nAn endorsement from the likes of Huang, whose draw at developer conferences now fill entire stadiums, could go a long way in assuaging investor concerns he himself might have veered off course.\n\u201cThe technology is really revolutionary and the work that they\u2019re doing is incredible,\u201d the Nvidia boss continued.\nIn a couple of weeks, shareholders are due to vote a second time on Musk's record pay package\u2014worth roughly $55 billion at the current stock price\u2014after a Delaware court in January voided the original 2018 vote for procedural reasons related to the quality of Tesla\u2019s governance.\nWith proxy advisors like Glass Lewis now recommending that investors vote against approving Musk's pay, the outcome of the June 13 annual meeting is proving tighter than expected.\nA vote of confidence in his new AI strategy from someone like Huang could boost his chances. Few businessmen are as respected as Huang, who founded Nvidia and managed its exponential growth over recent years thanks to a prescient bet on repurposing graphic processors to train AI models like OpenAI\u2019s flagship GPT-4o.\nHuang praised the\u00a0twelfth\u00a0and latest version of Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, which abandoned the previous approach of hard-coding commands in computer language in favor of relying solely on an AI-enabled neural network.\n\u201cIt learns from watching videos,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThis technology is very similar to the technology of large language models, but it requires just an enormous training facility and the reason for that is because the data rate of video, the amount of data, is so,\u00a0so\u00a0high.\u201d\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7iqeYx9HU\nThat said, Huang also knows how important Tesla is as a client. Musk is a voracious customer of Nvidia\u2019s AI training chips, more than doubling his compute capacity just in the first quarter over the final three months of last year.\nDuring that period Tesla spent the staggering sum of $1 billion to build out its AI infrastructure, and that\u2019s just the beginning. Tesla forecasts its compute capacity equivalent to 35,000 GPU clusters should hit 85,000 by year\u2019s end, by which point it may have spent $10 billion.\nTo afford that kind of investment at a time when its core car business needs to keep offering margin-eroding incentives to keep sales from cratering, Musk is willing to go to almost any length to cut costs elsewhere.\nHe has already sacked thousands of employees, fired the team behind his industry-leading Supercharger network and scrapped plans to invest in all-new assembly lines for its a upcoming $25,000 entry model, now widely expected to be a Model 3 hatchback.\nBut if it helps Tesla hold onto its leadership in the EV industry\u2014and make Musk $55 billion wealthier in the process\u2014those sacrifices may not have been in vain.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 28, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Alphabet GOOGL and Arista Networks ANET.\nNvidiareported earnings this week and posted another quarter of stunning growth, beating analysts' estimates on both the top and bottom line and announcing a ten-for-one stock split.\nNvidia continues to completely dominate the AI infrastructure industry, providing all the major technology businesses of the world with the GPUs and data center products required to run the extremely demanding models.\nThe word \"dominating\" almost doesn't capture the influence this company is having on the industry, and its outrageous growth rates are truly something to behold.\nQuarterly revenue of $26 billion was up 18% from the prior quarter and 262% YoY, while Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion was up 23% on the quarter and 427% on the year.\nNet income for the quarter was $14.8 billion and is up 628% YoY. To put that growth into perspective, Nvidia's total annual revenue in 2021 was $16 billion, which is now about how much profit they make in just a quarter!\nSometimes in the market we see growth stocks with great stories, and huge growth projections go on incredible runs in a short period, only to fall back to earth when the growth doesn't materialize. That is not what's happening at Nvidia.\nGrowth at Nvidia has already been realized with sales and earnings having already climbed many multiples over just the last year, and with more to come.\nAs of right now sales for this year are expected to increase 77.6% to $108 billion, but next year's sales growth is still fairly tepid, with forecasts of 20.5%. While this year's estimates are lofty, analysts remain grounded as they look further out.\nWith just 20% growth projected for next year, we could even see more upside surprises.\nWhen looking at relative valuations, Nvidia is actually cheaper than it was a year ago. At the beginning of 2023, NVDA was trading at a forward earnings multiple of about 90x, while today it is trading at 45.3x FY24 earnings estimates and just 36x FY25 earnings estimates.\nWhile yes, Nvidia's stock has appreciated nearly 4x over the last year, earnings have outpaced that growth! Earnings are up nearly 6x in that time, and margins have expanded from 18.5% to 54.3%.\nWith those growth rates, and improved business fundamentals, you could argue that Nvidia deserves an even richer earnings multiple.\nI don't know about other research publications, but at Zacks we have been all over Nvidia this last year. In the chart below we can see that earnings estimates began to rise in Q2 2023, and at that time it jumped onto the Zacks Rank.\nIt has enjoyed a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating for nearly that entire time, besides occasional periods of dropping down to a Rank #2, when analysts took breaks from upgrading it.\nA number of contributors here have been pounding the table about buying Nvidia stock, and if you look back, I have published a number of bullish writeups over the last year.\nEven with the reasons shared here, many investors will still resist buying Nvidia stock, and I do understand the psychological difficulties with buying a stock that has rallied so much already. So, for those investors I will share my other top picks to ride the AI wave.\nAlphabet has quickly jumped near the front of the AI expansion. At its most recent developer conference, Alphabet shared a number of exciting new AI integration to its suite of products.\nAI Agents, they call them, will act as an assistant across Gmail, Search, and Android devices.\nAlphabet also boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, as well as a historically discounted valuation. Trading at 22.8x forward earnings, it is below its 10-year median of 26.2x.\nAdditionally, Alphabet stock has been showing considerable relative strength against most of the other mega-cap technology stocks, outperforming all the Magnificent Seven excluding Nvidia in the last three months.\nAnother AI beneficiary with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating is Arista Networks.\nLess well known than most of its AI counterparts, Arista Networks specializes in high-performance, software-driven network switches and routers for data centers, cloud computing, and large-scale enterprise environments.\nArista Networks plays a crucial role in the AI boom by providing the advanced networking infrastructure required for AI workloads. Its high-speed, low-latency switches and routers facilitate the efficient data flow and massive computational power needed for AI and machine learning applications.\nNot everyone has missed this quiet AI-winner though, as analysts have been steadily raising earning estimates over the last year, and the stock has rallied nearly 100% over the last year.\nIn just the last two days I have had a number of people reaching out and asking, \"is it too late to buy Nvidia?\" And my answer is no, it probably isn't too late.\nOf course, it would have been better to buy it last year when it was trading at $200, but even at $1,045 per share there is still upside. However, with a market cap of $2.5 trillion now, the upside is unlikely to be as pronounced as when it was much smaller.\nFortunately for investors, there are additional stocks to get involved in for exposure to the AI boom, and this new technology will likely lead markets for the foreseeable future.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Author": "  Kent Thune ",
        "Text": "The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) reported Tuesday that global semiconductor sales jumped 15% on a year-over-year basis, as Regionally, as sales\u00a0increased in China (27.4%), the Americas (26.3%), and Asia Pacific (11.1%), and only slight declines in other regions.\nThe report also said March sales declined 0.6% month over month.\nThe largest exchange-traded fund focused on semiconductor stocks, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), was mostly flat midday. While investors appear cautious ahead of Nvidia\u2019s earnings due later this month, the report\u2019s issuer offered a bright outlook for the rest of the year.\n\u201cThe market is expected to continue to grow during the remainder of the year, with double-digit annual growth projected for 2024,\u201d said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO.\nFor investors expecting eye-popping sales increases and big earnings beats from Nvidia on a quarterly basis, anything less than extraordinary news may not be enough to push semiconductor stock prices higher, as they may already be priced to perfection.\nThe average price-earnings ratio for holdings in the SMH ETF is 29, according to Morningstar, while the P/E on the S&P 500 index is just under 25, as reported by Y Charts. For reference, the average historical P/E for the S&P 500 ranges from 15-20.\nSMH is up about 10% since its most recent low on April 19 and is now trading around 5% below its all-time high price.\nWith Nvidia\u2019s first-quarter earnings results slated for May 22, Goldman Sachs analysts maintained their buy rating on Nvidia stock Tuesday and raised their 12-month target price from $1,000 to $1,100. This price target represents an increase of 20% from Wednesday\u2019s price of $916 and would mark an all-time high for the $2.2 trillion semiconductor company.\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "Author": "  Will Daniel ",
        "Text": "Nvidia shares surged 9% to a record high above $1,000 on Thursday after another blowout earnings report, but the stock is about to get a lot cheaper as the AI chip leader announced a 10-for-1 split that will help retail investors more readily buy its shares.\nBank of America analysts, led by Jared Woodard, head of the bank\u2019s research investment committee, described the share split as \u201canother large-cap tech pursuing shareholder-friendly policies\u201d in a Thursday note to clients. Nvidia is the fourth Magnificent Seven Big Tech company to announce a stock split since 2022, with Google, Amazon, and Tesla also \u201call making shares more accessible,\u201d Woodard and his team noted.\nWith many Big Tech companies seeing their share prices top $500 in recent years, something that can limit retail investors\u2019 ability to buy shares, they've been looking to make it easier for nonprofessional investors to buy in. In other words, \u201cBig Tech is going bite-sized,\u201d BofA said.\nBofA\u2019s sell-side analysts have long been bullish on shares of Nvidia, and they once again hiked their lofty 12-month price target for the chip giant after Thursday\u2019s earnings release\u2014this time from $1,100 to $1,320. Nvidia shares could surge another 26% if the outlook proves prescient, and the stock split might help with that bullish move, according to Bank of America\u2019s reading of history.\n\u201cSplits have boosted returns in every decade, including the early 2000s when the S&P 500 struggled,\u201d Woodard and his team explained.\nSpecifically, Bank of America\u2019s research shows that stocks have managed 25% total returns in the 12 months after a stock split historically, compared with 12% for the S&P 500.\nBank of America also noted that stock splits even manage to spark bull runs in stocks that have been struggling. BofA gave the example of chip company AMD and oil-refining giant Valero, both of which saw their share prices surge after announcing stock splits, despite a poor performance prior to the split. \u201cSince gains are more common and larger than losses on average, splits appear to introduce upside potential into markets,\u201d the analysts added.\nHowever, channeling the Securities and Exchange Commission here, it\u2019s important to add the caveat that all mutual funds are required to tell investors by law: \u201cPast performance is not indicative of future results.\u201d\nBank of America was also quick to note that \u201coutperformance is no guarantee\u201d after a stock split. Companies that announce stock splits still see negative returns 30% of the time, and when they do, the average drop is a sizable 22% over the following 12 months.\n\u201cWhile splits could be an indication of strong momentum, companies can struggle in a challenging macro environment,\u201d the analysts noted. \u201cCompanies like Amazon, Google, Tesla, and Dexcom struggled in the 12 months after splits were announced in 2022 as interest rates spiked.\u201d\nStill, the vast majority of Wall Street analysts remain bullish on shares of Nvidia: The company boasts 48 \u201cbuy\u201d ratings, eight \u201coverweight\u201d ratings, six \u201chold\u201d ratings, and zero \u201csell\u201d ratings, according to the Wall Street Journal. And CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s announcement that Nvidia will develop another new AI chip within the next 12 months, because the company is now on a \u201cone-year rhythm\u201d of development, was also just the news bulls wanted to hear.\nAs Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives, a noted Nvidia bull, put it in a Thursday note: \u201cThe Godfather of AI, Jensen, and Nvidia delivered another masterpiece quarter and guidance that should be hung in the Louvre.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's Why",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nThe power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Nvidia is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\nFor Nvidia, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Nvidia\nFor the fiscal year ending January 2025, this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to earn $25.10 per share, which is a change of 93.7% from the year-ago reported number.\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Nvidia. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 8%.\nBottom Line\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\nThe upgrade of Nvidia to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Hong Kong, May 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- \n\nTrace Labs, the core developer of OriginTrail, has recently become a member of the NVIDIA Inception program. Achieving this milestone serves not only as a recognition of the importance of creating a Verifiable Internet for Artificial Intelligence (AI) with OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), but also opens up an opportunity to work closely with an industry leader in the field of AI.\nWhat is the NVIDIA Inception program?\nNVIDIA Inception is a program designed to help companies evolve faster through cutting-edge technology, opportunities to connect with venture capitalists, and access to the latest technical resources from NVIDIA. Inception program support also includes access to NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute and unlimited access to the NVIDIA Developer Forums, allowing Trace Labs to be in close contact with the latest software and hardware AI product developments NVIDIA is bringing to the market.\nTowards the Verifiable Internet for AI\u00a0As a part of the Inception program, Trace Labs will be able to further its vision of the\u00a0Verifiable Internet for AI\u00a0that aims to limit AI\u2019s current shortfalls (e.g. hallucinations, IP infringements, bias, and model collapse) and instead offer information provenance, data ownership and integrity as the core pillars of future AI solutions.

        "Title": "Arista Delivers Holistic AI Solutions in Collaboration with NVIDIA",
        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "Optimal GPU and Network Coordinated Performance\nSANTA CLARA, Calif., May 29, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET) today announced a technology demonstration of AI Data Centers in order to align compute and network domains as a single managed AI entity, in collaboration with NVIDIA. In order to build optimal generative AI networks with lower job completion times, customers can configure, manage, and monitor AI clusters uniformly across key building blocks including networks, NICs, and servers. This demonstrates the first step in achieving a multi-vendor, interoperable ecosystem that enables control and coordination between AI networking and AI compute infrastructure.\nNeed for Uniform Controls\nAs the size of AI clusters and large language models (LLMs) grows, the complexity and sheer volume of disparate parts of the puzzle grow apace. GPUs, NICs, switches, optics, and cables must all work together to form a holistic network. Customers need uniform controls between their AI servers hosting NICs and GPUs, and the AI network switches at different tiers. All these elements are reliant upon each other for proper AI job completion but operate independently. This could lead to misconfiguration or misalignment between aspects of the overall ecosystem, such as between NICs and the switch network, which can dramatically impact job completion time, since network issues can be very difficult to diagnose. Large AI clusters also require coordinated congestion management to avoid packet drops and under-utilization of GPUs, as well as coordinated management and monitoring to optimize compute and network resources in tandem.\nIntroducing the Arista AI Agent\nAt the heart of this solution is an Arista EOS-based agent enabling the network and the host to communicate with each other and coordinate configurations to optimize AI clusters. Using a remote AI agent, EOS running on Arista switches can be extended to directly-attached NICs and servers to allow a single point of control and visibility across an AI Data Center as a holistic solution. This remote AI agent, hosted directly on an NVIDIA BlueField-3 SuperNIC or running on the server and collecting telemetry from the SuperNIC, allows EOS, on the network switch, to configure, monitor, and debug network problems on the server, ensuring end-to-end network configuration and QoS consistency. AI clusters can now be managed and optimized as a single homogenous solution.\n\"Arista aims to improve efficiency of communication between the discovered network and GPU topology to improve job completion times through coordinated orchestration, configuration, validation, and monitoring of NVIDIA accelerated compute, NVIDIA SuperNICs, and Arista network infrastructure,\" said John McCool, Chief Platform Officer for Arista Networks.\nEnd-to-End AI Communication and Optimization\nThis new technology demonstration highlights how an Arista EOS-based remote AI agent allows the combined, interdependent AI cluster to be managed as a single solution. EOS running in the network can now be extended to servers or SuperNICs via remote AI agents to enable instantaneous tracking and reporting of performance degradation or failures between hosts and networks, so they can be rapidly isolated and the impact minimized. Since EOS-based network switches are constantly aware of accurate network topology, extending EOS down to SuperNICs and servers with the remote AI agent further enables coordinated optimization of end-to-end QoS between all elements in the AI Data Center to reduce job completion time.\n\"Best-of-breed Arista networking platforms with NVIDIA\u2019s compute platforms and SuperNICs enable coordinated AI Data Centers. The new ability to extend Arista\u2019s EOS operating system with remote AI agents on hosts promises to solve a critical customer problem of AI clusters at scale, by delivering a single point of control and visibility to manage AI availability and performance as a holistic solution,\" said Zeus Kerravala, Principal Analyst at ZK Research.\nArista will demonstrate the AI agent technology at the Arista IPO 10th anniversary celebration in NYSE on June 5th, with customer trials expected in 2H 2024.\nIf you are a member of the analyst or financial community and are interested in attending the NYSE event, please register here.\nTo read more about the new AI Centers check out CEO and Chairperson Jayshree Ullal\u2019s blog here.\nAbout Arista\nArista Networks is an industry leader in data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for large data center/AI, campus, and routing environments.

        "Author": "  Shaun Pruitt ",
        "Text": "Nvidia NVDA\u00a0shares are up over +10% in today\u2019s trading session after reporting its Q1 results Wednesday evening and posting another quarter of exponential growth. Furthermore, there is still an abundance of reasons to buy the chip giant's stock.\nWith Nvidia\u2019s stock hitting fresh record highs, the leader in AI accelerating GPUs posted Q1 EPS of $6.12 which beat the Zacks Consensus of $5.49 per share by 11% and skyrocketed 461% from $1.09 a share in the prior-year quarter. Quarterly sales of $26 billion came in 7% better than expected and leaped 262% from $7.19 billion a year ago.\nBetter still, here are five shareholder viewpoints as to why now is an ideal time to invest in Nvidia following its exhilarating Q1 report.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia\u2019s Guidance Continues to Impress\u2026\nFueling the post-earnings spike in Nvidia\u2019s stock was the company\u2019s sales guidance which could keep the rally going in the coming weeks. To that point, Nvidia expects sales for the second quarter to increase 107% to $28 billion, guiding impressively above the current Zacks Consensus of $26.24 billion (Current Qtr below) or 94% growth.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia is Becoming a Cash Cow\u00a0\u00a0\nStarting to mirror Apple\u2019s AAPL\u00a0impressive balance sheet, Nvidia is becoming a cash cow with the chip giant now having over $30 billion in cash and equivalents. Further illustrating the strength of Nvidia\u2019s business operations is that its free cash flow climbed over 400% during Q1 at $14.93 billion compared to $2.64 billion in the comparative quarter. On a sequential basis, Nvidia\u2019s free cash flow spiked 33% from $11.21 billion at the end of Q4.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nStock Split\nWith NVDA now trading over $1000 a share, Nvidia announced it will be doing a 10-1 forward stock split that will take effect on Monday, June 10. Of course, the split is aimed at making stock ownership more affordable to employees and investors but this is another reason to believe NVDA could run higher beforehand. \u00a0\u00a0\nIncreased Dividend \nOne thing Nvidia will be doing with its growing cash pile is increasing its dividend by 150% from $0.04 a share to $0.10 per share.\u00a0Notably, Nvidia returned $7.8 billion to shareholders during Q1 in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends.\u00a0The increased dividend will be equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis and will be paid on Friday, June 28 payable to shareholders on record by Tuesday, June 11.\nIndustry Leadership \nLastly, being the leader of the AI boom has bolstered Nvidia\u2019s growth and remains the most obvious reason to own its stock. Nvidia\u2019s leadership among chipmakers will likely continue with its highly anticipated Blackwell series of GPUs. \u00a0\nStill expected to launch by the end of the year and thought to be the most advanced AI accelerative GPUs to date, Nvidia stated the production for the Blackwell series is in full swing with an impressive list of time-to-market customers including Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META, Oracle, ORCL, Tesla TSLA, and OpenAI among others.\nBottom Line\nThere was a lot to like about Nvidia\u2019s Q1 results and for now, NVDA continues to sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) attributed to these compelling shareholder viewpoints and the fact that earnings estimate revisions have continued to rise.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, has risen 1.7%, while the CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, has rallied 0.6%.\nCrypto analytics platform DYOR's relative strength crypto narrative tracker shows decentralized AI coins and DePIN \u2013 or decentralized physical infrastructure \u2013 tokens are among the best performers of the past seven days.\n\"There is a strong buzz around Nvidia's impending earnings,\" Hitesh Malviya, founder of DYOR, told CoinDesk. \"AI coins will keep having cyclical runs [higher] as they are directly correlated with the whole AI-side development happening around us.\"\nThe chipmaker is set to report first-quarter earnings on May 22 after the market close. Zacks Investment Research expects the company to report earnings per share of $5.49, a 403% year-on-year increase. Recent results from other AI companies have been largely positive, according to Bloomberg.\nShares in NVDA rose to $922 on Monday, hitting the highest since April 1. They have recovered more than 20% from the low of $756 reached on April 19, according to data source TradingView.\nOver the years, bitcoin and the broader crypto market have developed a strong positive correlation with NVDA, whose chips were used to power mining rigs before garnering interest from AI. NVDA and the crypto market bottomed out in late 2022, ending an almost year-long downtrend with the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which helped raise general awareness about artificial intelligence.\nSpeculation is rife that OpenAI is likely to launch version 5 of ChatGPT in the coming months. Late last month, technology giants reported a better-than-expected quarterly earnings growth powered by substantial investments in artificial intelligence.\nNotably, during Apple\u2019s recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook talked about the company\u2019s continued investments in generative AI and teased major AI-related announcements at \"Let Loose event\" on May 7 and the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10.\n\"OpenAI will launch a new model in the coming months, better hardware will be developed, and more funds will be injected into the space.

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Manali Pradhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The U.S. stock market has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth over the past decade despite multiple economic challenges and geopolitical pressures. This environment has helped pave the way for high-growth companies such as Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft to reach the coveted trillion-dollar market capitalization.\nThese companies have demonstrated powerful and scalable business models, visionary management, and rapid organic and inorganic market expansion. Plus, these companies have quickly adopted technologies such as data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing.\nOnly a few other companies share similar characteristics and may be next in line to cross the trillion-dollar market capitalization mark by 2030. Here's why Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) fits the bill and may soon join the trillion-dollar club.\nThe increasing demand for accelerated computing infrastructure and AI-driven data centers has been the major growth catalyst for Broadcom, especially for the networking business in the past couple of years. In fiscal 2024's first quarter, ended Feb. 4, Broadcom's AI revenue quadrupled year over year to $2.3 billion, offsetting the cyclical slowdown in other businesses. The company now expects AI-related revenue to account for almost 35% of its fiscal 2024 semiconductor revenue at $10 billion , up from its previous estimate of $8 billion.\nThis upward revision can be mainly attributed to the solid demand for its custom AI chips and networking solutions such as Tomahawk 5 800G switches, Ethernet, digital signal processing (DSP) platforms, and optical components by large-scale enterprises deploying AI data centers and hyperscale customers.\nBesides catering to enterprise AI demand, Broadcom's networking solutions are also used extensively in consumer-facing AI applications. In its fiscal Q1 2024 earnings call, management highlighted the strong demand for the company's custom AI chips at two hyperscalers .\nAlthough the company has not disclosed the names of these clients, many analysts have zeroed in on Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Since these clients own vast amounts of data and have a very large subscriber base, they stand to benefit dramatically from the use of custom AI chips in targeted areas such as search, SEO, and digital marketing. Since Broadcom seems to have cultivated deep, strategic, and multi-year relationships with these hyperscalers, it is well-positioned to develop custom AI chips catering to their specific needs.\nBroadcom has a proven track record of designing and manufacturing high-performance and energy-efficient custom AI chips as well as multiple AI-optimized networking components capable of handling complex workloads for foundational models and large language applications. Coupled with the company's long-term relationships with its clients and a supporting software ecosystem, Broadcom is poised to thwart competition from new players in the custom silicon space.\nThe acquisition of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions player VMware is also proving to be a major growth catalyst for Broadcom. In the first quarter, the company's infrastructure software revenue was up 153% year over year to $4.6 billion, with VMware contributing almost $2.1 billion during the 10.5 weeks of the quarter (as the acquisition was completed in November 2023).\nConsolidated software bookings grew nearly three times year over year to $1.8 billion in the first quarter and are expected to reach $3 billion in the second quarter. Broadcom expects revenue from the VMware portfolio to grow sequentially by a double-digit percentage every quarter throughout fiscal 2024.\nBroadcom's VMware strategy mainly involves upselling VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) to existing customers, especially those already running compute workloads with vSphere virtualization tools. VCF is a complete software stack, which includes computing, storage, and networking capabilities, and acts as an alternative and complement to the public cloud platforms for the customers' on-premise data centers.\nThe company is focusing on developing an improved VCF stack to sell to its largest 2,000 strategic customers, many of whom need a hybrid cloud solution (mix of private and public cloud infrastructure) for their on-premise distributed data centers. Broadcom has also partnered with Nvidia to form VMware Private AI Foundation, which enables VCF to run GPUs. This initiative is helping further drive demand for VCF.\nThe global virtualization software market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 22.3% from $40 billion in 2023 to $300 billion in 2033. Broadcom seems well-poised to capitalize on this opportunity, thanks to the synergies between its software offerings and acquired VMware portfolio. The company expects its overall software revenue to be $20 billion in fiscal 2024, which will end Oct. 31.\nBroadcom's hardware and software offerings are used in multiple end markets including smartphones, telecommunications, and a variety of industrial applications. The diversified client base has made the overall business resilient since fluctuations in a few end markets can be partly offset by others.\nBroadcom shares are currently trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 16.6, significantly higher than their five-year average of 9.3. However, considering the company's ability to capitalize on the growing demand for accelerated computing and data center infrastructure across industries, this high valuation seems justified.\nThe company is poised to generate revenue of $50.2 billion in fiscal 2024. Assuming its P/S ratio remains constant (due to AI tailwinds), the company will have to grow its revenue to about $61 billion to support a $1 trillion market capitalization. This seems to be a very achievable target, since analysts are projecting Broadcom's revenue to grow to $62.8 billion by fiscal 2026.\nHence, it makes sense for long-term retail investors to consider buying at least a small stake in this AI-powered stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Demand for NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell Platform Expected to Boost TSMC\u2019s CoWoS Total Capacity by Over 150% in 2024, Says TrendForce",
        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "TAIPEI, Taiwan, May 03, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NVIDIA\u2019s next-gen Blackwell platform, which includes B-series GPUs and integrates NVIDIA\u2019s own Grace Arm CPU in models such as the GB200, represents a significant development. TrendForce points out that the GB200 and its predecessor, the GH200, both feature a combined CPU+GPU solution, primarily equipped with the NVIDIA Grace CPU and H200 GPU. However, the GH200 accounted for only approximately 5% of NVIDIA\u2019s high-end GPU shipments. The supply chain has high expectations for the GB200, with projections suggesting that its shipments could exceed millions of units by 2025, potentially making up nearly 40 to 50% of NVIDIA\u2019s high-end GPU market.\nAlthough NVIDIA plans to launch products such as the GB200 and B100 in the second half of this year, upstream wafer packaging will need to adopt more complex and high-precision CoWoS-L technology, making the validation and testing process time-consuming. Additionally, more time will be required to optimize the B-series for AI server systems in aspects such as network communication and cooling performance. It is anticipated that the GB200 and B100 products will not see significant production volumes until 4Q24 or 1Q25.\nThe inclusion of the GB200, B100, and B200 in NVIDIA\u2019s B-series will boost demand for CoWoS capacity, leading TSMC to raise its total CoWoS capacity needs for 2024. The estimated monthly capacity by the end of the year is expected to reach nearly 40K\u2014a staggering 150% year-over-year increase. By 2025, the planned total capacity could nearly double, with NVIDIA's demand expected to make up more than half of this capacity.\nOther suppliers, such as Amkor and Intel, currently focus on CoWoS-S technology and are primarily targeting NVIDIA\u2019s H-series. With technological breakthroughs expected to be challenging in the short term, expansion plans remain conservative unless these suppliers can secure additional orders beyond NVIDIA, such as self-developed ASIC chips by CSPs, which might lead to a more aggressive expansion strategy.\nNVIDIA and AMD\u2019s AI development set to propel HBM3e into mainstream market dominance by the second half of the year\nTrendForce has identified three major HBM trends for NVIDIA and AMD\u2019s primary GPU products and their planned specifications beyond 2024: Firstly, the transition from HBM3 to HBM3e is anticipated. NVIDIA is expected to start scaling up shipments of the H200 equipped with HBM3e in the second half of 2024, replacing the H100 as the mainstream. Following this, other models such as the GB200 and B100 will also adopt HBM3e. Meanwhile, AMD plans to launch the new MI350 by the end of the year and may introduce interim models like the MI32x in the meantime to compete with the H200, with both utilizing HBM3e.\nSecondly, there will be a continued expansion in HBM capacity to boost the overall computational efficiency and system bandwidth of AI servers. The market currently predominantly uses the NVIDIA H100 with 80GB of HBM, which is expected to increase to between 192GB and 288GB by the end of 2024. AMD\u2019s new GPUs, starting from the MI300A\u2019s 128GB, will also see increases, reaching up to 288GB.\nThirdly, the lineup of GPUs equipped with HBM3e will evolve from 8Hi configurations to 12Hi configurations. NVIDIA\u2019s B100 and GB200 currently feature 8Hi HBM3e with a capacity of 192GB, and by 2025, the B200 model is planned to be equipped with 12Hi HBM3e, achieving 288GB. AMD\u2019s upcoming MI350, to be launched by the end of this year, and the MI375 series, expected in 2025, are both anticipated to come with 12Hi HBM3e, also reaching 288GB.\nFor further details of this press release, including the accompanying tables and figures, please visit: https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240416-12119.html\nFor additional insights from TrendForce analysts on the latest tech industry news, trends, and forecasts, please visit our blog at https://www.trendforce.com/news/\nAbout TrendForce (www.trendforce.com)\nTrendForce is a global provider of the latest development, insight, and analysis of the technology industry.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\nHere are the key points:\nTotal earnings for the 440 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results are up +5.0% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 78.0% beating EPS estimates and 60.9% beating revenue estimates.\nThe earnings and revenue growth pace for these 440 index members represents a modest acceleration from what we had seen in other recent periods. The +5% earnings growth pace improves to +11.9% once the Energy sector and Bristol Myers\u2019s one-time charge are accounted for.\nFor 2024 Q2, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.2% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues. Estimates have been increasing since the start of April, with the current +9.2% earnings growth pace up from +8.7% on April 3rd.\nLooking at the calendar year picture, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow by +8.9% this year after last year\u2019s modest decline. Excluding the hefty Tech sector contribution, whose 2024 earnings are expected to be up +15.9%, earnings for the rest of the index would be up only +6.3%.\nWe have consistently flagged signs of improvement in the overall revisions trend in recent weeks, with estimates starting to go modestly up. We are seeing this trend for the current period (2024 Q2) as well as for full-year 2024 estimates.\nThis new development has roughly coincided with the start of the Q1 earnings season. That said, several sectors, including Tech and Retail, had already been enjoying positive estimate revisions for quite some time. At present, half of the 16 Zacks sectors have higher aggregate earnings estimates than expected at the start of the year.\nWe have recently highlighted the favorable revisions trend for the Energy sector in this space. This week, we will discuss the evolving earnings outlook for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 stocks.\nPlease note that the $443.9 billion the group is currently expected to earn in 2024 is up from $438.1 billion last week and $428.2 billion the week prior to that.\nWe all know that the revisions trend for Tesla TSLA has been negative for a while now, while the same for Apple AAPL is also negative, though the magnitude of negative revisions for Apple is far less severe.\nThe revisions trend for the remaining five members of this group is positive enough to more than offset the Tesla and Apple effects. Of these five, Nvidia NVDA is in a league of its own.\nA big part of this year\u2019s earnings growth is expected to come from margins reversing last year\u2019s declines and starting to expand again. The expectation is that aggregate net margins this year get back to the 2022 level, with the Tech sector driving most of the gains.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Fahad Saleem ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of top 10 most buzzing AI semiconductor stocks in 2024. Since AMD ranks higher in the list, it needs a deeper look. But first, let's see what's happening in the semiconductor industry with a special focus on AI.\nThe semiconductor industry seems have found a new growth catalyst in the form of AI that could keep it thriving and abuzz for years to come, as analysts see no end in sight for the demand for AI-specific chips needed to power generative AI applications that would be ubiquitous from just a few years from now. Earlier this month, analysts at Citi published a bullish note for semiconductor stocks, citing strong March sales, which jumped about 15.7% year over year to total $50.6 billion. The figure was higher than Citi's $50.1 billion estimate. Citi analyst Christopher Danely highlighted that most of the demand bump came from analog and microcontrollers, which were up about 50% on a month-over-month basis.\nAre AI Semiconductor Stocks Overvalued?\nSemiconductor stocks have run so much on the back of the AI boom that many are voicing valuation concerns. And it's always surprising when such concerns come from Cathie Wood, one of the notable growth investors of this age who poured (and lost) a fortune into hyper-growth stocks trading at eye-popping valuations. In March, Cathie Wood warned that the semiconductor space could see a \"correction.\" However, Wood clarified that she's just expecting a \"correction\" and not an \"end\" of the sector.\nSince the end of March, VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) is up 10%.\nBut Cathie Wood isn't alone in these valuation worries. Analysts believe since the AI-rally is no longer limited to big names like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and MSFT, investors should caste a wider net. And we did just that. Our latest research unlocked many AI-related stocks trading at attractive valuations. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nFor this article we used stock screeners and did manual research to see which AI-related semiconductor stocks were generating the most buzz. From these stocks we chose the ones with the highest number of hedge fund investors and strong YTD gains. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAn aerial view of a bustling semiconductor production zone showcasing the company\u2019s integrated circuits.\nYTD Price Performance: +19%\nLast month Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) posted strong Q1 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.62, beating estimates by $0.01. Revenue jumped 2.2% year over year to $5.47 billion, beating estimates by $20 million. For the second quarter, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) expects revenue in between $5.4 billion and $6 billion, while estimates called for $5.72 billion.\nJ.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur said Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) can significantly increase its data center GPU revenue and can continue to poach market share from Intel in server and PC CPUs market.\nMeridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\u201cAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel\u2019s. We invested on the the belief that AMD\u2019s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD\u2019s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.\u201d\nIt seems NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) always takes the center stage when it comes to the AI semiconductor industry. Take a cursory look at the latest earnings calls and you'll see executives joining the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) praise chorus, chalking out plans to pile into more H100 GPUs. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s latest results show a spectacular increase in data center revenue, but a lackluster increase in operating income (+26%) threw water on the enthusiasm around the stock. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) bears also say the stock's P/E ratio of over 240 is amongst the highest in the chips industry. Surprisingly, AMD's forward P/E ratio is about two times higher than Nvidia's.\nWith NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) valuations already raising concerns and AMD coming in not as attractive, what are the options for beginner investors who are looking to board the AI rally? The market is always presenting itself with opportunities for those who know where to look. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n \nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

The robust quarterly results we've received from NVIDIA over the last year have added further fuel to the fire, with the company flexing the scorching-hot demand it's been witnessing regarding its AI chips.\nLet's take a closer look at the technology titan's latest report and a few other stocks investors can buy to ride the data center wave.\nNVIDIA yet again blew away quarterly expectations in its recent report, continuing its streak of robust quarterly results. Concerning headline figures, NVDA posted an 11% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and reported sales 7% ahead of expectations, reflecting growth rates of 460% and 260%, respectively.\nOf course, the real highlight of the release was the Data Center results, which included sales from its AI chips. Data Center revenue totaled $22.6 billion, yet again reflecting a quarterly record and up a sizable 430% year over year.\nJensen Huang, CEO, on the results, 'Our data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.'\nThe company's Data Center sales have been the hottest story in the market, consistently flexing robust growth over the past year.\nThe technology titan announced a 10-for-1 split, aiming to make stock ownership accessible to a greater portion of employees and investors. Shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on June 10th.\nAnd to put the cherry on top, the company also raised its quarterly dividend payout by 150%.

        "Title": "Nvidia's split of soaring stock could boost retail investor appeal, Dow chances",
        "Author": "  Medha Singh and Lewis Krauskopf ",
        "Text": "By Medha Singh and Lewis Krauskopf\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Nvidia's plan to split its stock after the stunning rise in the chipmaker's share price could lure more interest from retail investors while potentially paving the way for the company's inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\nNvidia shares were soaring 10% on Thursday afternoon after the company announced a 10-for-one stock split as part of a blockbuster quarterly report included its revenue and forecast coming in above analyst estimates.\nNvidia, which has become the poster child of investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, is the latest U.S. megacap company to unveil a stock split in recent years, including Amazon.com, Alphabet and Tesla. Nvidia itself executed a four-for-one split in mid 2021.\nFor Nvidia, the third-largest U.S. company by market value, the stock split could spark more interest from individual or retail investors, analysts said. The chipmaker's shares have already more than doubled so far in 2024.\nAlthough a split alone does not change a stock's valuation, market analysts said the lowered per-share value of the stock woos individual investors, who tend to trade in smaller lots due to their limited funds in comparison to institutional investors, who have deeper pockets.\n\"The stock split is probably the biggest catalyst to keep attracting retail flows,\" said Marco Iachini, senior vice president at Vanda Research.\nNvidia's lead in the AI boom already has made it the most popular stock among individual investors over the past year. The stock is the highest weight in the average retail trading portfolio at 9.3%, followed by Apple at 9.2% and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF at 7.8%, Vanda said in a note issued on Wednesday. A year ago, Nvidia made up 4.2% of the average portfolio.\nMore recently, retail traders' interest in the stock has slowed.\nThe latest weekly data shows a five-day rolling sum of retail-trader inflows into Nvidia stood at $278.3 million, down from a peak of $576.8 million in March, according to Vanda.\nWhile many retail investors can buy shares on a fractional basis, reducing the need for a stock's price to be lower, not all such investors have that access, said Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at digital brokerage eToro. That made Nvidia's share price \"an increasing obstacle,\" Laidler said. The stock was last trading at around $1,040.\nStill, while Nvidia's split, effective June 7, \"should appeal to retail investors ... the value of the business won\u2019t have actually changed,\" said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell.\n\"The value of someone\u2019s investment is completely unaffected,\" Coatsworth said.\nIn an \"FAQ\" document about the stock split, Nvidia said: \"Given the significant appreciation of the company\u2019s share price in recent years, the stock split is intended to make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors.\" The company offered no further comment beyond its statements announcing the split.\nSTOCK SPLIT OUTPERFORMANCE\nCompanies that announce stock splits have tended to outperform the market. Those announcing splits have seen their shares rise an average of 25.4% over the next 12 months versus an 11.9% rise for the S&P 500, according to an analysis from BofA Global Research from February.\nBut a stock split alone is unlikely to overcome the host of other factors that can sway stocks. Shares of Amazon and Alphabet fell sharply in 2022 even though the companies both announced splits during the year, as surging interest rates weighed on stocks broadly.\nS&P 500 companies have executed 31 stock splits since 2020, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nThat is far fewer than occurred during the early 2000s and late 1990s.\nDOW IN SIGHT\nIn Nvidia's case, its split could make the stock more manageable for inclusion in the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average. The 30-member Dow is a price-weighted index, so Nvidia's current price would make it twice the size of the largest weight in the Dow currently.\nThe split would reduce Nvidia's price to about $104 as of Thursday's price. That would make it the 21st-biggest stock in the Dow, just behind Merck and ahead of Walt Disney. Nvidia is the third-biggest stock in the market cap-weighted S&P 500.\nSimilar speculation about Dow inclusion followed Amazon's split in 2022. Amazon was added to the Dow earlier this year.\n\"Nvidia certainly checks all the boxes to eventually become a Dow component: great reputation, history of sustained growth, interest to investors, and its sector representation of the broader market,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, adding: \"The $100 price would make the initial math easier.\"\nAn S&P Dow Jones Indices spokeswoman said it does not comment or speculate on index additions or deletions.\nShe referred to the Dow's methodology which says, \"A stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors,\" and that the index committee \"evaluates stock price when considering a company for inclusion.\"\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru and Lewis Krauskopf in New YorkAdditional reporting by Pranav Kashyap and Ankika BiswasEditing by Megan Davies and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 6, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Nvidia NVDA and Tesla TSLA.\nWith Q1 results from Apple and Amazon now out, we only have Nvidia\u2019s results still awaited at this stage of the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 group of companies. The sub-par growth numbers from Tesla and Apple notwithstanding, the Mag 7 group as a whole showed impressive top- and bottom-line growth numbers.\nIn fact, had it not been for the substantial earnings contribution from the Mag 7, Q1 earnings growth for the rest of the S&P 500 index would be in negative territory.\nIt is interesting to note here that the market reaction to the Tesla and Apple releases has thus far been the best of the group. This may look odd since Tesla\u2019s Q1 earnings were down -53.4% from the year-earlier level on -8.7% lower revenues, and Apple\u2019s earnings and revenue growth rates were -2.2% and -4.3%, respectively. But it isn\u2019t surprising as both companies\u2019 results proved better than what market participants had feared. We also need to keep in mind the impact of Apple\u2019s blockbuster buyback announcement, the largest ever in history.\nUsing estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its March-quarter results on May 22nd, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q1 earnings for the group are expected to be up +49% from the same period last year on +13.6% higher revenues.\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 29.9% of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 21.2% of the index\u2019s total earnings in 2024. For 2024 Q1, the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 22.1% of all S&P 500 earnings.\nGiven their enormous earnings power and growth profile, it is hard to argue with the group\u2019s market leadership.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +28.2% from the same period last year on +8.9% higher revenues.\nWe remain in the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with more than 1200 companies reporting results, including 54 S&P 500 members. This week\u2019s notable reports include Disney, Uber, Lyft, Shopify, and others.\nThrough Friday, May 3rd, we have seen Q1 results from 400 S&P 500 index members, or 80% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total Q1 earnings for these 400 index members are up +4.4% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 78.3% beating EPS estimates and 61% beating revenue estimates.\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +5.3% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\nAs you likely know already, the Tech and Energy sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -2.2%, while the growth pace improves to +8.3% on an ex-energy basis.\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.9% on +1.7% revenue growth.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> A Positive Earnings Picture Remains \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "2 Large-Cap Stocks That Have Roughly Doubled Nvidia's Returns Over the Past Year",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Chip maker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the great investing stories in tech over the past couple of years. With the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT and companies investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), Nvidia's business is booming as its chips play a big role in helping companies develop their own AI models. That business boom is helping the stock soar. In the past 12 months, its price is up about 238%.\nBut as well as Nvidia's stock has done in the past year, there are a couple of other large-cap stocks that have performed even better. Two stocks that have roughly doubled Nvidia's returns over the past 12 months include Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Carvana (NYSE: CVNA). Here's a look at their returns over this time frame and why they have been such hot buys, and whether they still make for good investments today.\nWith gains of 445%, Super Micro's stock has dwarfed Nvidia's 12-month returns. As with Nvidia, this has become a popular AI investment to own as demand for more servers and greater computing power has made investors bullish on the company's long-term prospects.\nSuper Micro's growth rate has been amazing, with sales totaling just under $3.9 billion through the first three months of the year -- three times the $1.3 billion it reported in the previous year. The company generates revenue primarily from its server and storage systems segment. Subsystems and accessories, its other segment, accounted for a relatively modest $152 million last quarter, representing just 4% of the company's overall top line. Profitability has also been improving, with Super Micro reporting $402 million in profit during the period, which was more than four times the $86 million in earnings it posted in the prior-year period.\nA big reason for Super Micro's enhanced returns over the past year is simply due to its much smaller valuation. Even with its massive returns, Super Micro's market cap is at $53 billion -- nowhere near Nvidia's mammoth $2.3 trillion valuation. What's encouraging is that the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 25, which is fairly modest given the gains the stock has already achieved. Nvidia, by comparison, trades at a forward P/E of 38.\nWith tremendous growth, solid prospects for more, and a fairly reasonable valuation given its long-term growth opportunities, it may still not be too late to invest in Super Micro stock.\nInvestors could have earned an even greater return from Carvana's stock over the past year but not without taking on a lot more risk. This once-beaten-down stock would have been a nine-bagger for investors who loaded up on it a year ago.\nIt wasn't too long ago that this was the stock nobody wanted: In 2022, shares of Carvana plummeted an amazing 98%. The online used-car retailer was burning through cash, interest rates began to rise, and demand for used cars softened.\nThe stock is heavily shorted, and that plays a big part in its overall volatility. While the short interest as a percentage of float has come down over the past year, it remains fairly high at around 30%.\nThe company has been proving its doubters wrong, at least to some extent, and that has helped drive the recent bullishness.\nFor the period ending March 31, Carvana posted a surprise profit of $49 million, which is a drastic improvement from the $286 million loss it incurred in the same period a year earlier. Sales of $3.1 billion were also up by 17% year over year. The company's cash-flow statement has also shown improvement as last quarter Carvana generated $101 million in cash from its day-to-day operating activities, while a year ago it burned through $66 million.\nCarvana generated some encouraging results last quarter, but that doesn't mean it's smooth sailing for the business as it's possible that a recession could still be on the horizon. And while the company has been doing better, it still hasn't proven it can generate consistent profits; its profit margin last quarter was just 1.6%.\nInvestors may be better off waiting at least a couple of quarters before assessing whether Carvana is truly a good buy or not, as the stock still possesses some considerable risk, especially given its volatility over the past few years and high short interest.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Better AI Stock: Intel vs. Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has skyrocketed since the start of 2023, with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT kicking off a boom in the industry. As a result, many tech stocks have enjoyed significant gains over the last 12 months as investors have grown bullish over the generative technology.\nIncreased demand for AI services has put a spotlight on chipmakers, highlighting the crucial role they have to play in the market's development. These companies are producing the hardware that makes AI possible, with chip demand soaring since last year.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been at the forefront of the AI chip industry, with its leading role in graphics processing units (GPUs) allowing it to get a head start in AI. Meanwhile, a competitor like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has had a slower start in AI, using the last year to develop chips to rival Nvidia's offerings.\nDespite their differences, both companies could be lucrative ways to invest in the budding market. Nvidia's more established position in AI could make its stock an excellent option for holding for many years. Meanwhile, Intel could have more room to run, with its journey into AI only just beginning.\nSo, let's compare these companies' businesses and determine whether Intel or Nvidia is the better AI stock this May.\nShares in Intel are up about 5% year over year. The figure is significantly lower than two of its biggest AI rivals, with Nvidia's stock rising 218% and Advanced Micro Devices' shares up 58% in the same period. However, Intel's position in the market is why it's crucial to keep a long-term perspective when it comes to tech stocks.\nIntel has had some challenging years, losing market share in central processing units (CPUs) due to increased competition, a marketwide downturn in 2022, and a pandemic-driven global chip shortage that has only recently begun to subside.\nRepeated hits to its business forced Intel to overhaul its entire model, prioritizing chip manufacturing and AI. The company is transitioning to a foundry model, with plans to build semiconductor manufacturing plants throughout the U.S.\nMeanwhile, Intel announced a range of new AI chips in April, debuting its Gaudi3 AI accelerator. The tech giant says the new hardware outperforms Nvidia's GPUs by 50% in inference and 40% in power efficiency.\nIntel still has a long way to go in AI, but its earnings in the first quarter of 2024 suggest the business is moving in the right direction. During the quarter, its data center and AI business segment posted revenue growth of 5% year over year, with operating income soaring 2,000%.\nAdditionally, Intel's free cash flow has risen by about $2 billion since January, indicating it's on a promising growth trajectory.\nNvidia has made more than a few headlines over the last year. Business has exploded as its GPUs have become the go-to for AI developers worldwide.\nThe company's leading market share in GPUs and partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI perfectly positioned it to take full advantage of the boom in AI in 2023. The chart above shows how Nvidia benefited from the industry's growth, with its stock skyrocketing alongside soaring revenue, operating income, and free cash flow over the last year.\nExperts estimate Nvidia has achieved an estimated 80% market in data center AI chips. Rivals like Intel and AMD are beginning to make headway, proven by recent growth in their recent earnings releases. However, the AI market is projected to hit nearly $2 trillion in spending by 2030, indicating there will be room for Nvidia to retain its lead and welcome new competition.\nIntel and Nvidia are at vastly different stages in their AI journeys. Nvidia has an established role in the market as the primary supplier of GPUs to dozens of AI businesses. Meanwhile, Intel only ventured into the GPU market last year and launched competing AI chips in 2024.\nAs a result, the choice between these companies lies in whether you'd rather pay a premium for the stability of an established AI business or bet on a better-valued up-and-comer.\nThis chart shows Intel has a significantly lower forward price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio than Nvidia. The figures indicate Intel is trading at a bargain compared to its rival, giving new investors more bang for their buck.\nWith such a considerable difference in value, I'd recommend investing in Intel if you're looking to get into AI. Intel's stock price of $30 per share, compared to Nvidia's $904 per share, means your money will go much further with Intel. And if held over the long term, the company could deliver major gains as it develops its AI business.\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "GMI Cloud, with roots in Taiwan, uses its supply chain advantage to grant companies instant and affordable NVIDIA GPU compute power for navigating the race to adopt AI\nSANTA CLARA, Calif., May 16, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GMI Cloud, the emerging GPU cloud platform designed for AI and ML workloads, is accelerating access to NVIDIA GPUs. Its new On-Demand cloud compute offering, available today, is built for companies that are serious about leveraging AI and unlocking the door from prototyping to production. Users can access GMI Cloud\u2019s On-Demand GPU computing resources almost instantaneously.\nThe Surge in Demand for Compute\nThe current surge in demand for AI compute power requires companies to be strategic in their approach. In a fast-evolving landscape, organizations are being asked to pay a 25-50% down payment and sign up for a 3-year contract with the promise of getting access to GPU infrastructure in 6-12 months. The AI shift has forced companies to need more flexible computing power.\nInstant GPUs, Infinite AI\nLeveraging its ties to Realtek Semiconductors (TPE: 2379) and GMI Technologies (TPE: 3312) as well as Taiwan's robust supply chain ecosystem, GMI Cloud is able to ensure quicker deployment and higher efficiency in operations. The physical presence in Taiwan cuts the GPU delivery time down from months to days compared to non-Taiwanese GPU providers. GMI Cloud is poised to become the most competitive new entrant in this market.\n\"Our mission is to empower humanity's AI ambitions with instant, efficient GPU cloud,\" said Alex Yeh, Founder and CEO of GMI Cloud. \"We're not just building a cloud\u2014we're creating the backbone of the AI era. GMI Cloud is dedicated to transforming how developers and data scientists leverage NVIDIA GPUs and how all humans benefit from AI.\"\nWhy It Matters\nTechnology leaders are seizing the opportunities presented by the growing AI wave, and organizations of all sizes are hitting walls when it comes to accessing compute power.\nStartups, for example, don\u2019t have the budget or long-term forecasting to pay a down payment for a large GPU installation. They need the flexibility to scale up or down based on their traction. This requires the option to pay for GPU as an operating expense rather than locking in capital that could be spent on hiring competitive AI talent. On-Demand access provides an instant, cost-effective, and scalable option for teams that need access to GPU compute, without requiring special skills to set up the infrastructure.\nLarge enterprises face hurdles as well. Enterprise data science teams, for example, require the flexibility to experiment, prototype, and evaluate AI applications to get ahead of competitors before the AI wave passes them by. However, not every enterprise is ready to commit to the long-term contracts and unproven capital expenditures required for larger compute reserves. The flexibility of instant GPU access allows those data science teams to run several prototyping projects that require processing large datasets or fine-tuning models without taking significant investment risks.\nGet Started Now\nGMI Cloud is a GPU cloud platform, powered by NVIDIA, with a rich Kubernetes-managed preloaded software stack designed specifically for AI and ML workloads which includes prebuilt images with NVIDIA TensorRT and will soon support all NVIDIA prebuilt containers including inference servers like NVIDIA Triton. With competitive pricing offered at $4.39/hour for NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs, GMI Cloud offers affordable on-demand access compared to larger organizations charging up to 4X that cost for on-demand in an effort to lock users into larger reserve packages. The instance type and size is purposefully designed to efficiently deploy, fine-tune, and inference models ranging in size from Llama3 8b, 70b, Mixtral 8x7b, Google Gemma, Stable Diffusion, and more.\nAbout GMI Cloud\nInstant GPU availability meets infinite AI possibilities with GMI Cloud, a venture-backed digital infrastructure company formed as an offshoot of Realtek Semiconductor and GMI Technology. As the leading AI-native GPU cloud, we provide rapid access to the latest GPUs meticulously optimized for AI and ML workloads. Our platform ensures seamless scalability and top-tier performance, designed to cater to the dynamic needs of startups, researchers, and enterprises alike. With GMI Cloud, experience the power of on-demand GPUs and unlock unlimited AI potential, enabling you to innovate faster, smarter, and more cost-effectively.

        "Title": "The Art of Valuation: Discovering NVIDIA Corp's Intrinsic Value",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAs of 2024-05-27, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $545.31. It's currently trading at a price of $1064.69. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -95.24%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$17.45\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.47%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 41.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n849.6\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n1436.51\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n545.31\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $493.10. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -115.92%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The U.S. economy has a century-long track record of producing the world's most valuable companies:\nUnited States Steel became the world's first $1 billion company in 1901.\nBy 1955, General Motors became the first $10 billion company.\nIndustrial giant General Electric rode its portfolio of businesses -- from aerospace to financial services -- to a $100 billion valuation in 1995.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) crossed the next big threshold in 2018 when it became the first publicly traded company to amass a $1 trillion market capitalization.\nToday, Apple is joined by Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia in the trillion-dollar club. But I think one more company is on the cusp of earning membership.\nWarren Buffett has led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) to a whopping 4,384,748% return since 1965, giving it a valuation of nearly $900 billion. The conglomerate owns substantial positions in private and public success stories like GEICO, Coca-Cola, and even Apple.\nHere's why Berkshire could become the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club within the next 12 months.\nBuffett is a quintessential value investor. He likes to buy good businesses at a cheap price, and sometimes great businesses at a fair price, with the intention of holding on to them for decades. He looks for companies with steady growth, consistent profitability, and strong management teams. He especially likes businesses that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\nHere's an example that perfectly displays the effects of compounding that helped Buffett build his empire. Berkshire spent $1.3 billion accumulating shares of American Express (NYSE: AXP) between 1991 and 1995. That holding has grown in value to a staggering $36.8 billion today. Even better, Amex stock makes Berkshire money just for owning it, paying Berkshire $364 million in dividends in 2023 alone. That dividend means Berkshire recoups its entire initial investment in Amex every four years just from the dividends. That's just one of the conglomerate's many success stories.\nBerkshire was originally a textiles business, and it was on the verge of failure when Buffett stepped in to buy it in 1965. When he realized he couldn't turn it around, he transformed it into a holding company for various investments.\nSince then, Berkshire has purchased many companies outright, including GEICO, Duracell, and Dairy Queen. But it also owns a portfolio of 47 publicly traded stocks and securities worth $377.9 billion. This portfolio includes its shares of Amex, Coca-Cola, and Apple.\nApple is Berkshire's single largest holding, with a value of $149.9 billion accounting for 39.7% of its stock portfolio. It would be even larger, but the conglomerate recently sold 13% of its position (reportedly for tax reasons). Considering Berkshire only spent around $38 billion accumulating Apple shares since 2016, this investment has seriously paid off.\nI want to take a moment to highlight the Coca-Cola stake, too. Berkshire spent $1.3 billion buying shares of the beverage giant between 1988 and 1994, and it has never sold any of them. Today, that position is worth $25.2 billion, and it paid Berkshire $736 million in dividends in 2023 alone.\nYou might notice the Coca-Cola story sounds very similar to the Amex story, and its is. What it points out is that Buffett didn't catch lightning in a bottle, nor is his strategy exceptional. In fact, Berkshire's long-term positions in Bank of America, Visa, and Moody's followed a similar trajectory, thanks to Buffett's simple formula centered around patient investing.\nIf investors are willing to maintain a long-term view, they can also reap the benefits of compounding in the same way.\nBerkshire Class A shares soared in value by 4,384,748% between 1965 and 2023. That translates into a compound annual return of 19.8%, which is nearly twice the 10.2% average annual return in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\nThe outperformance is mind-boggling in dollar terms. An investment of $1,000 in Berkshire stock in 1965 would have been worth $43.8 million at the end of 2023! The same investment in the S&P 500 would be worth just $312,230.\nBerkshire has the financial results to support its incredible returns. The business generated $49.3 million in revenue during 1965, a figure which grew to $364.4 billion last year. Berkshire's diverse portfolio of businesses contributed to the latter number: $83.4 billion came from insurance premiums; $101.4 billion came from its railroad, utilities, and energy businesses; and $155.6 billion came from sales and services across the various entities under Berkshire's umbrella.\nBerkshire also grew its net earnings from just $2.3 million in 1965 to a whopping $96.2 billion in 2023.\nConsidering Berkshire has a market capitalization of nearly $900 billion as of this writing, its stock only needs to gain 11% from here to catapult the company into the $1 trillion club. Its 58-year-long track record of delivering 19.8% annual returns (on average) suggests it's a shoo-in to get there within the next 12 months.\nA few things will work in Berkshire's favor going forward. For starters, Apple just announced a $100 billion stock buyback, which is the largest in the history of corporate America. That will organically increase the conglomerate's equity stake in the iPhone maker. Plus, top holdings like Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola continue to raise their dividends, so Berkshire will likely earn a record payout this year.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is also likely to cut interest rates in the second half of 2024. That could spark an increase in economic activity which should boost many of the businesses in Berkshire's portfolio, especially those serving consumers and those in the transport and logistics industries.\nFinally, Buffett continues to be a big believer in the company's future. He authorized the repurchase of $9.2 billion worth of Berkshire's shares in 2023 and a further $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Buffett has now overseen $71.4 billion worth of share repurchases since 2020 alone, which is more than he has deployed into any other stock.\nAbsent any external economic shocks, Berkshire appears almost certain to be the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club in the coming year.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.
