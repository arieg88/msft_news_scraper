        "Text": "If artificial intelligence (AI) was the story of 2023, then Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the stock of the year.\nNo other company's products were as in demand from the generative AI boom, and no other company has the financial performance to prove it. Nvidia stock finished 2023 up 239% last year, crossing the trillion-dollar mark to become only one of five U.S. stocks to have a valuation above that line. The business also delivered phenomenal growth on the top and bottom lines.\nIn its third quarter, revenue jumped 206% to $18.12 billion, and its net income according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) jumped more than thirteenfold to reach $9.24 billion, giving it a margin of more than 50%.\nHeading into 2024, Nvidia looks to be in great shape for even more growth. Its AI-focused H100 accelerators are in such high demand that prices for them have skyrocketed, and there's a shortage of its GPUs and other components used for its AI models.\nThe spoils of the AI boom are likely to spill over to other companies in 2024, and while Nvidia may retain its lead in AI chips, other chip stocks could narrow the gap. Here are three that could outperform the AI chip leader in 2024.\nIf any semiconductor company is going to pose a challenge to Nvidia in AI capabilities, it seems likely to be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).\nThe company's launch of its Instinct MI300 AI accelerators in December was highly anticipated, and the stock jumped 10% on the launch presentation, a sign Wall Street liked what it saw.\nAmong the customers for the new component are Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Microsoft, and Oracle, among others. AMD also said the Instinct Platform can offer a throughput increase of 60% for running inference on large language models compared with the Nvidia H100 HGX.\nAMD also made a number of acquisitions in the AI space recently. It acquired AI software leader Mipsology and Nod.ai, an open-source AI software expert, which will help it accelerate its deployment of AI solutions.\nAMD stock was no slouch in 2023. The stock jumped 128%. But expectations in 2024 are still modest, with the consensus calling for 16% revenue growth. If its new products take off, AMD could easily top that forecast and the stock could soar.\nACM Research (NASDAQ: ACMR) is a relative unknown in the semiconductor sector. The company doesn't make chips, but instead makes machines that clean semiconductor wafers, an important process to ensure that these tiny components don't make errors.\nThat position in the value chain makes ACM something of a picks-and-shovels play in the sector, but it also stands to benefit from the AI boom, since cleaning requirements are likely to become more technical as chips become more advanced and AI components become more in demand.\nACM Research is a small company, with a market cap of $1.2 billion, but its recent results are impressive. Revenue rose 26% to $21.3 million, with a 31% increase in shipments even during a cyclically challenging period in the semiconductor industry. On the bottom line, adjusted net income rose 33% to $37.5 million.\nACM is mostly focused on China, where it's considered a domestic supplier. That could give it an advantage at a time when a tech cold war between the U.S. and China is heating up, with the U.S. banning the export of some advanced technologies to China.\nThe stock is cheap at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15, so it shouldn't take much to drive the stock higher in 2024, even after it gained 154% in 2023.\nFinally, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) also looks poised for a strong performance in 2024.\nTaiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, is the world's largest contract semiconductor foundry, handling roughly half of semiconductor manufacturing for companies including\u00a0Apple, Qualcomm, Broadcom, AMD, Nvidia, and Intel.\nAI makes up about 6% of the company's revenue, but given the company's strong position in chip manufacturing and even larger market share in the manufacturing of advanced chips, it should see steady growth ahead from increasing AI demand.\nLike other semiconductor companies, TSMC is fast at work increasing capacity to handle demand for AI production. That momentum may already be starting to build, given that revenue in October jumped 16% from the year before.\nCompared with the chip designers, TSMC stock is also affordably priced, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 20. With a broader recovery in the chip sector expected in 2024, TSMC could be a big winner.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Sells Graphics and AI Chips, but 15% of Sales Come From Other Multi-Hundred-Billion Dollar Markets",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In 1999, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) revolutionized computer graphics with the invention of the graphics processing unit (GPU), a chip capable of rendering ultra-realistic visual effects. Nvidia GPUs have since become the gold standard in gaming and professional design. The company holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics processors.\nIn 2006, Nvidia moved beyond graphics when it introduced CUDA, a programming model that turned its GPUs into general purpose processors fit to accelerate data center applications like artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia GPUs are now the gold standard in data center accelerators, and the company holds an 80% to 95% market share in AI chips, according to analysts.\nNot surprisingly, given its dominance in graphics and AI processors, Nvidia is frequently described as a chipmaker. But that definition is somewhat misleading, because it fails to capture the scope and direction of the business. Nvidia currently derives about 15% of total revenue from adjacent multi-hundred-billion markets.\nNvidia reported revenue of $18 billion in the third quarter. That figure becomes $72 billion when annualized (multiplied by four). GPUs for gaming, professional design, and data centers accounted for most of that total, but management said software and services revenue would exceed an annual run rate of $1 billion by year end. That means Nvidia derives about 1.3% of total revenue from software and services.\nThat percentage may sound insignificant, but the figure is growing rapidly. The three products detailed below form the core of the software and services business. The first became available in late 2021, but the other two became available less than one year ago. As such, Nvidia has rapidly turned software and services into a billion-dollar business.\nAI Enterprise is a suite of software and frameworks that supports the development of AI\u00a0applications across a range of disciplines, such as recommender systems in retail, intelligent digital assistants in customer service, and route optimization in logistics.\nDGX Cloud is a cloud service that combines supercomputing infrastructure, pretrained models, and Nvidia AI Enterprise software to create an AI-as-a-service offering. Businesses can use DGX cloud to build AI applications without actually purchasing Nvidia GPUs.\nOmniverse Cloud is a cloud service that combines GPU-accelerated infrastructure with design and simulation software. It supports 3D application development and synthetic data generation, which can be used to train autonomous robots and self-driving cars.\nFor context, management says AI Enterprise, DGX Cloud, and Omniverse Cloud collectively represent a $300 billion addressable market. That means they account for almost one-third of the company's $1 trillion total addressable market.\nHere's the upshot: Nvidia is more than a chipmaker. It is a full-stack accelerated computing company, because its portfolio spans infrastructure, software, and services. That makes Nvidia a one-stop shop for graphics and AI, which cements its leadership status in both spaces.\nTo quote CFRA analyst Angelo Zino, \"We believe ... [Nvidia's] full-stack AI and software capabilities provide an incredible competitive moat.\"\nIn 2019, Nvidia extended its data center presence by acquiring networking company Mellanox. Nvidia has since melded its own innovations with Mellanox technology to great effect. Networking revenue nearly tripled over the past year, becoming a $10 billion business. That means Nvidia derives about 13.8% of revenue from networking infrastructure, a market expected to approach $200 billion in 2024.\nMoreover, Nvidia networking products are purpose-built for AI. Its InfiniBand networking platform is the gold standard in AI infrastructure for large-scale consumer internet companies and cloud providers, and it has already been adopted by Microsoft, according to CFO Colette Kress. Additionally, Nvidia recently announced Spectrum-X Ethernet networking for enterprise AI. That platform will be available early this year.\nHere's the upshot: Nvidia has improved its ability to monetize AI with InfiniBand and Spectrum. But those platforms also make its entire product portfolio more attractive by extending its full-stack strategy. Larger cloud companies and smaller enterprises can purchase all the requisite technology for developing, deploying, and running AI workloads from a single vendor. That drives cost savings by simplifying implementation and reducing complexity.\nTo quote Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, \"Nvidia's value proposition at the core is we are the lowest cost solution.\"\nNvidia was the best-performing S&P 500 stock last year, as enthusiasm surrounding generative AI drove its share price 239% higher. But the company remains well positioned to create value for patient shareholders, especially as its ability to monetize AI improves through continued success with software, services, and networking products (currently about 15% of total sales).\nGoing forward, the graphics processor market is expected to increase at roughly 28% annually through 2030, while the AI market is projected to increase at 37% annually during the same period. That gives Nvidia a good shot at annual sales growth exceeding 25% through the end of the decade.\nIn that context, its current valuation of 31 times sales is tolerable, despite being a substantial premium to the three-year average of 23.6 times sales. To be clear, Nvidia is not without risk, and shares are not cheap. But patient investors should consider buying a small position in Nvidia stock today, especially as part of a larger basket of AI stocks.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

This law majorly benefited domestic chipmakers like Nvidia.\nSince selling their 25,000 shares, the Nvidia stock price has surged by almost 200%, according to the New York Post, which means the value of the Pelosis\u2019 original stake would have been worth in excess of $12.2 million today.\nHowever, the duo has certainly made up for it in other transactions.

        "Title": "Could Investing $20,000 in Nvidia Make You a Millionaire?",
        "Author": "  Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Semiconductor designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has made many millionaires in recent years. Its stock has more than tripled in the last year alone. Among stocks with a market cap of at least $50 billion today, Nvidia has outperformed absolutely everybody over the past three, five, and 10 years. It's hard to beat this wealth-building machine these days.\nSo what's next? Let's say I scrape together a robust $20,000 Nvidia position today -- can I expect to make a million dollars on that investment?\nThe short answer is yes, but it'll take a while and the lofty target result isn't guaranteed.\nLooking back, Nvidia's stock chart from the past eight years is nothing short of extraordinary. Starting from a respectable $23 billion market cap in 2016, the company's strategy has shifted along with the market opportunity.\nNvidia's expertise in high-performance graphics cards for gaming and professional graphics turned into a crypto bonanza when enthusiasts found the same cards to be excellent for mining Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) tokens. Just as Ethereum switched to a different technology with no need for miners, OpenAI came along with its ChatGPT tool, unveiling a new dawn in generative artificial intelligence (AI). Based on the same high-end graphics platforms as the gaming and crypto surges, Nvidia's AI accelerator processors powered the back-end creation of ChatGPT's AI engine.\nNow, lots of companies with AI-powered ambitions are buying hundreds or even thousands of extremely pricey accelerator chips and Nvidia is the first supplier that comes to mind at this point. It shows in Nvidia's spectacular financial results and the stock chart that follows:\nThe chart above shows the return of a $20,000 investment started on May 16, 2016, resulting in a $1.0 million value nearly 8 years later. That's an average annual return of 67.4%.\nAt the end of that market-crushing chart, Nvidia is worth $1.4 trillion. The stock rose to this height the hard way, delivering top-notch products attuned to the right market opportunities at the right times. The end result is a legendary price gain with record-high investor returns. Sorting the total stock market's 10-year gains, I don't even need to limit the field with a large market-cap requirement to weed out short-lived meme stocks and other gadflies. Nvidia simply offered the strongest decade-long returns of any stock tracked by the screeners at my disposal.\nBut things are different now. It may be difficult to grow a $23 billion market cap 50-fold, but even tougher when you start with a $1.3 trillion stock-value footprint. Even if Nvidia continues to dominate the AI market, and that trend delivers on the most striking predictions for years to come, it's unrealistic to assume an average annual return of 67% for another eight-year run.\nBy the end of that rainbow, Nvidia would be worth $67.6 trillion. That's more than double the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States, estimated at $26.9 billion in 2023. I'm sorry, but that's going to take a while.\nNvidia's past performance has set a high bar and it's important to manage your expectations for the next phase of its AI business. The exceptional gains of recent years are not likely to continue for another 8-year span. That would require not only continued success in the booming AI sector for nearly a full decade, but also sustained hypergrowth in the market itself and unshaken investor confidence in Nvidia's lofty valuation ratios. The stock trades at 72 times earnings and 30 times sales today. These overheated ratios should cool down over time, raising the needed financial support for that $67 trillion market cap in the process.\nOf course, Nvidia could lower the bar with some accounting tricks. The company can return cash to shareholders by means of generous share buybacks and dividends.\nOther companies have pursued this strategy before. For example, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) has seen its share price fall by 2% over the last 10 years while its market cap shrunk by 14%. At the same time, Big Blue bought back 12% of its issued shares and delivered robust dividend payouts. All in all, IBM investors pocketed a respectable total return of 50% over the same period.\nNvidia could attempt a larger-scale version of this, boosting the returns by sharing cash profits with the company's investors. Of course, this cash-sharing idea takes away from the company's freedom to invest in future growth-boosting business plans, so there's a fine line between generosity and growth-blunting missteps.\nAnd of course, anything is possible over a long enough time span. America's GDP stopped at $1.5 trillion in 1973, comparable to Nvidia's market value today. Suggesting that any single company could deserve a trillion-dollar market cap would have sounded ridiculous 50 years ago, but here we stand with 6 stocks in the trillion-dollar club. A few decades from now, that $67 trillion target might not look so silly anymore.\nThe real question is, will Nvidia still be around in 2064 or 2074, and will it dominate its chosen markets for that long? I don't think so, but anything is possible.\nSo yes, Nvidia just might be able to grow that a $20,000 investment into a cool million, but it's a long road to that ambitious target and many things can go wrong along the way. Remember, this stock delivered the richest shareholder returns of any company over the last decade, and even that stellar run barely exceeded the 50-fold gain it takes to meet that goal.\nThat being said, I'm not closing out my own Nvidia position anytime soon, though I might take advantage of its recent moonshot by diversifying some of the gains into other investment ideas. I'm still looking at a proven AI giant with a bright future, and its valuation has calmed down a bit in recent weeks. Buying Nvidia stock today makes perfect sense if you can stomach it trading at nosebleed-inducing prices. The next wave of processor orders for AI systems could make the last surge look forgettable by comparison.\nSo feel free to invest in Nvidia today. Just don't expect the incredible returns of the last 8 years to continue for another multi-year span. To make me a happy Nvidia investor, all the company needs to do is deliver stock price gains comparable to or exceeding the stock market as a whole.\nAt an annual clip of 15%, a 50-fold return would materialize after 28 years.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Not a lot of stocks outperformed Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in 2023. In fact, the artificial intelligence (AI) chip superstar was the best-performing stock on the S&P 500 index.\nNvidia shares jumped 239% last year as the company delivered blowout results thanks to skyrocketing demand for its GPUs and accelerators, which are crucial components for the infrastructure that makes AI models like ChatGPT.\nHowever, Nvidia wasn't the top performer in the entire stock market. One of the handful of companies that beat it was a little-known AI stock called Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). Here's how the two stocks did last year.\nNot only did Super Micro Computer, commonly known as Supermicro, beat Nvidia, but the stock is already up 67% in 2024, meaning it's gained nearly 500% since the end of 2022.\nWhat is this under-the-radar stock that's soaring in the AI boom? Let's take a closer look at Super Micro Computer and whether it's a smart buy today.\nIt's not a coincidence that Supermicro stock delivered results similar to Nvidia last year. The company has a lot in common with the AI chip kingpin.\nSuper Micro Computer makes high-performance and high-efficiency server and storage systems that are especially useful for AI applications.\nAs Supermicro explains it, AI workloads typically require expedited access to storage, which has driven demand for GPU-based servers. Supermicro's server systems run on Nvidia GPUs and help maximize throughput, eliminate bottlenecks, and minimize latency. The accelerated IO (input/output) of those systems can improve performance by 20% to 100% for intensive workloads.\nThat technology and its utility in running AI models is starting to drive significant growth at Supermicro.\nMuch like Nvidia did a few quarters ago, Supermicro just reported preliminary results for its fiscal second quarter that were much better than its forecast back in November. Supermicro reported revenue of $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion, compared to its earlier guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. On the bottom line, it posted adjusted earnings per share of $5.40 to $5.55, which was ahead of its prior forecast of $4.40 to $4.88.\nSupermicro didn't offer much of an explanation for the soaring growth, only saying that it had strong market and end customer demand. Investors will likely learn more when Supermicro reports its complete second-quarter earnings report after hours on Monday.\nSupermicro's update was reminiscent of Nvidia's hockey-stick-like growth last year as its revenue suddenly tripled, greatly exceeding Wall Street's expectations.\nSupermicro appears to be on a similar path given the dramatic growth in the stock, but there's an important difference between the two companies. Supermicro operates with narrow gross margins. In the first quarter, they were just 16.7% and actually fell from the year before.\nTypically, a company with low gross margins does not have pricing power, or it's competing on cost. That's much different from Nvidia, which has been able to raise prices on its AI chips because there's a shortage of them and its competitors can't match its performance, at least not yet.\nBoth stocks also trade at reasonable valuations. In fact, Supermicro is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34, including its second-quarter result. Hardware is cyclical, and the fact that SuperMicro and Nvidia have relatively low P/E ratios for their growth rates shows that the market is skeptical that the current boom will last. Unlike software, hardware isn't recurring revenue, and semiconductor companies tend to see revenue fall in down cycles.\nHowever, the AI boom still appears to be just getting started as hyperscalers like Oracle are building data centers as fast as they can, and the hardware needed to run them is likely to be in high demand for the foreseeable future.\nThere's still a lot of uncertainty in the evolving AI market, which means that Supermicro stock carries risk, but with the updated guidance, its similarities to Nvidia, and unprecedented demand for AI hardware, the upside potential clearly outweighs the downside risk.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Super Micro Computer wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "The Best AI Investment Right Now Is Obvious (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Although many point to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) as the best artificial intelligence (AI) investment right now, I'm staying away from it. Because Nvidia is a hardware company, this strength will eventually fade, and investors will be stuck holding a stock valued for a business it no longer has.\nInstead, a far better alternative to Nvidia is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google. I've got four reasons why Alphabet will be a much better long-term investment today than Nvidia, and why its business is more sustainable.\nAs mentioned above, Nvidia is a hardware company. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the best in class for AI model training. However, once it sells the GPU, that's it. Unless clients come back to build additional supercomputers or upgrade their system down the line, Nvidia's sales are a one-time benefit.\nAlphabet is a massive Nvidia GPU buyer, but it has set up a subscription model using these products. One of Alphabet's most exciting segments is Google Cloud, its cloud computing division. By filling data centers with powerful Nvidia GPUs, clients who need access to extreme computing power can rent it from Alphabet. This allows these clients to stay asset-light and quickly scale up or down according to their needs. Because the revenue stream from this business is recurring, it's far more sustainable.\nAdditionally, Alphabet has other AI products, like its generative AI model Gemini. This model beats the competition in multiple tests and will create a new revenue stream for Alphabet as it's implemented into various programs.\nWhile Nvidia's one-time sales may provide flashy year-over-year growth figures in boom times, they're not as sustainable as Alphabet's subscription-focused approach.\nBecause Nvidia is a pick-and-shovel play, it saw the first wave of AI demand. With companies like Alphabet ordering thousands of GPUs to outfit their data centers, it experienced a sudden demand rush. It's not advisable to invest in a company in the middle of a demand rush, as many lofty expectations are already baked into the stock.\nWhile Alphabet has seen increased demand for cloud computing and generative AI, it's in the early stages. This means the rush hasn't happened for Alphabet yet, making me more excited to get into Alphabet's stock before the big move comes along.\nAnother issue with Nvidia's stock is how expensive it has gotten. With Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sitting at a much higher level than Alphabet's valuation, it has a lot of expectations built in.\nAlphabet doesn't have nearly the same hype around its stock and trades at about the same level as the broader S&P 500, which has a forward P/E of 20.\nIf Alphabet maintains its status quo, it will still be a market-beating stock. If Nvidia misses expectations, the bottom will fall out of the stock.\nFinally, Alphabet is far more diversified than Nvidia. If this AI trend turns out to be a bust (I don't think it will be), then a large swath of Nvidia's business will evaporate. This wouldn't be the first time this has happened to Nvidia, as multiple crypto crashes have caused the company's revenue to drop rapidly when demand fell.\nAlthough many investors (including myself) are excited about Alphabet's AI prospects, at the end of the day, nearly 80% of its revenue comes from advertising services. Advertising has been around for thousands of years and likely won't fade away anytime soon.\nSo, regardless of how successful AI proliferation is, Alphabet should be fine.\nTo me, Alphabet is a much better investment right now than Nvidia. While Nvidia may see strength throughout the rest of 2024, it will likely eventually experience a drop in demand due to its non-subscription business model. If you like roller coasters, Nvidia may be a better stock, although you may never return to the highs you experience early on. But if you like a steady, market-beating ride, Alphabet is a far better pick.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

It earned a massive boost from developments in AI, given that its semiconductors are often used to create the infrastructure used by the emerging technology.\nThe company is also not slowing down, and Rasgon highlighted the launch of new products that will keep it on top, such as the Grace Hopper super chip and a coming upgrade to its H200 GPU.\n\"I don't know that the multiple can go down any more than frankly it has,\" he told CNBC in December.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Text": "Perhaps no company has benefited more from the boom in generative artificial intelligence (AI) than Nvidia, which has seen its stock price rise more than 200% over the past 12 months as customers hoard its hardware to run these complex applications. \nBut investors don't have to put all their eggs in one basket. Let's discuss why Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) could also be excellent ways to bet on the opportunity. \nNvidia currently dominates the industry for AI-capable graphics processing units (GPUs), with a market share of over 80%. But with high prices and steadily growing demand, the opportunity is ripe for competition. In 2024 and beyond, AMD hopes to claim a slice of this valuable niche, potentially supercharging its long-term growth in the process. \nCEO Lisa Su believes the $45 billion market for AI chips could rise to $400 billion by 2027. And her company has released its new MI300 family of GPUs designed to compete with Nvidia's flagship H100 for training and running AI applications. Management expects the products to add around $2 billion to 2024 sales. \nTo be fair, that's a modest sum compared to the $20.1 billion that AMD earned over the trailing 12 months. But the figure could rise to $20 billion in three years if the company maintains a share of just 5% (assuming Su's prediction of a $400 billion market comes to fruition). \nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 48, AMD's valuation prices in a lot of growth expectations, so the company doesn't have much room for error. However, the unprecedented rise of AI hardware demand suggests it can meet expectations and continue outperforming. \nWith shares already soaring by 67% in 2024, Super Micro Computer looks set to continue the rally that has sent its stock up fivefold in just 12 months. While the company is no longer as cheap as it was at the start of last year, it can benefit from the success of its hardware suppliers and its own innovations in data center modernization. \nSuper Micro plays an important role in the data center chip industry by turning hardware made by companies like Nvidia into consumer-ready computers that enterprises can use for data storage and running and training AI applications. The surging demand for AI chips has lifted its fortunes, with management raising fiscal second-quarter guidance from a best-case of $2.9 billion to between $3.6 billion and $3.65 billion. \nGranted, Super Micro's business model makes it uncomfortably dependent on hardware supplies allocated by its partners. But as data center operations become more demanding, the company could also generate increasing revenue from its liquid cooling systems, designed to help clients prevent heat from damaging their hardware.\n Analysts at Rosenblatt Securities believe this business may have played a role in Super Micro's guidance increase. And over time, it could give the company some much-needed diversification. With a forward P/E of 25, Super Micro stock is cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 index of 30, making it a relatively affordable way for investors to bet on this opportunity.\nAdvanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer are great ways to gain exposure to the AI hardware opportunity. But their stocks suit different investment strategies. AMD might offer more growth potential at a higher price tag, while Super Micro is a more value-oriented pick. \nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Super Micro Computer wasn't one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.NVIDIA\u2019s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company\u2019s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.NVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company\u2019s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company\u2019s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.Santa Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023, slightly up from $26.91 billion in fiscal 2022.Beginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments \u2013 Graphics and Compute & Networking.Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.Compute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.Graphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 44% and 56% of fiscal 2023 revenues, respectively.\nBottom Line\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Nvidia a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in January 2014 would be worth $139,122.70, or a 13,812.27% gain, as of January 15, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\nThe S&P 500 rose 159.66% and the price of gold increased 60.15% over the same time frame in comparison.\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for NVDA.\nNVIDIA's Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVIDIA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 53.7% through fiscal 2024-2026. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\nThe stock has jumped 11.90% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 15 higher, for fiscal 2024; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In 2023, artificial intelligence (AI) quickly rocketed to the forefront of investors' minds and pocketbooks. And shares in the industry leader, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), ballooned 237% over the last 12 months as its revenue and profits soared. This stemmed from rising demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) for running and training the most advanced AI applications. \nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock rose 137% in the same period. But unlike Nvidia, AMD's rally was more based on future expectations (third-quarter revenue grew just 4% compared to Nvidia's 206%). So, in 2024, AMD will have to prove itself deserving of all the hype.\u00a0\nSince it acquired ATI Technologies in 2006, AMD has been a direct competitor to Nvidia in the market for GPUs. These computer chips work by running multiple tasks simultaneously (parallel processing) -- a technique that turned out to have huge potential for training the vast amounts of data required for generative artificial intelligence applications. \nAnd the potential market for AI-capable enterprise GPUs makes the video game industry look like a chump change. \nAccording to AMD, the $45 billion AI chip market could rise almost tenfold to $400 billion by 2027. To take advantage of the opportunity, AMD has released its MI300X family of chips designed to compete with Nvidia's flagship H100 for AI data center clients. \nAMD's management expects the new chips to generate $2 billion in additional sales in 2024, which is somewhat modest considering the potentially huge total addressable market. However, analysts at Barclays believe this number could be closer to $4 billion. And this would represent an 18% growth rate compared to AMD's trailing-12-month revenue, assuming all its other businesses remain constant. \nThat's a lot of growth to get from one type of product. And if AMD's lofty projections about AI chip demand hold true, investors should expect sales to scale up dramatically between 2025 and 2027. \nBut even in the best-case scenario, AMD still lags behind Nvidia, which saw its data center chip business add $4.9 billion in sales between the second and third quarters of calendar year 2023 alone.\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 43, AMD's stock is dramatically more expensive than Nvidia, which trades for a comparatively modest 29 times projected earnings. This disparity is surprising considering Nvidia's significantly faster growth rate and faster product release/update cycle, which can lead to better pricing power. \nThat said, investors shouldn't see artificial intelligence as a zero-sum game. The market is growing fast enough for many companies to succeed.\u00a0And although later to market than its rival, AMD could establish a niche through lower prices and better value for money. The upstart could make a solid pick as part of a balanced and diversified investment portfolio. \nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The past five years have been rewarding for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors. The semiconductor specialist's stock is a solid multibagger, turning a January 2019 investment of $1,000 into $14,550 as of this writing.\nThis terrific jump in Nvidia's stock price over the past decade can be attributed to the outstanding growth in the company's revenue and earnings. This growth is fueled by multiple catalysts, including the booming demand for gaming hardware, the growing demand for high-performance computing applications, the increasing deployment of semiconductors in cars, and now the need for graphics cards for training artificial intelligence (AI) models.\nThe good part is that Nvidia is setting itself up to deliver even stronger returns over the next five years through its aggressive product roadmap, which should allow it to capitalize on multiple multi-billion-dollar opportunities. It's worth noting that the company pointed out a couple of years ago that it sees a $1 trillion revenue opportunity across several end markets such as automotive, gaming, enterprise software, and chips and systems.\nGiven that it's on track to finish fiscal 2024 (which will end this month) with $59 billion in revenue, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia's revenue and earnings growth accelerating big time over the next decade as it dives deeper into its addressable market. Let's look at the reasons why that may happen and where the stock could be after five years.\nWhen Nvidia reported its fiscal 2019 results five years ago, the company generated annual revenue of $11.7 billion. So, Nvidia's revenue is on track to increase 5 times in a space of five years considering its fiscal 2024 forecast, translating into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38%. A similar CAGR over the next five years would take Nvidia's annual revenue to a whopping $295 billion in fiscal 2029.\nHowever, certain Wall Street analysts believe that Nvidia could do even better. Take Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh, for example. He predicts that Nvidia could generate annual revenue of $300 billion in 2027 from selling AI chips alone, thanks to having a solid 75% share of this fast-growing market. While that may seem outrageous at first, a closer look at the market for AI chips indicates that Nvidia could indeed hit that ambitious mark.\nIt's well known that Nvidia is the biggest player in one of the hottest tech niches right now -- AI chips -- which has allowed the company to record a terrific jump in revenue and earnings over the past year.\nNote that this market for AI chips is at the beginning of a huge growth curve. Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices estimates that the market for AI accelerators could jump to $400 billion in 2027, a big jump from last year's estimate of $45 billion. Citi analysts expect Nvidia to maintain a giant 90% share of this market over the next two to three years, despite the efforts its rivals are making to cut Nvidia's lead in this market.\nThat's because Nvidia has doubled down on the pace of innovation in AI chips, which should help it maintain a solid share of this market in the long run. As such, the possibility of Nvidia indeed generating $300 billion in annual revenue from AI chip sales after five years cannot be ruled out. It can hit that mark even if its share falls to 75% -- as Rakesh suggests -- considering that the overall AI chip market size is anticipated to hit $400 billion as per AMD's estimates.\nThe good news is that Nvidia is looking to flex its muscles beyond the AI accelerator market. The company recently revealed new consumer-focused graphics cards people can use to run AI applications right on their desktops and laptops for gaming, creating large language models (LLMs), customizing generative AI models, and even inferencing applications. For instance, Nvidia claims that its new RTX 4080 Super graphics card \"generates AI video 1.5x faster -- and images 1.7x faster -- than the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU.\"\nGiven that the demand for devices that can run AI at the edge -- such as smartphones, personal computers, and cameras -- is expected to clock annual growth of 26% through 2032 and generate $143 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period, Nvidia is doing the right thing by tapping this market early.\nAlso, considering the other notable catalysts that Nvidia could benefit from, it won't be surprising to see the company's top line head closer to $300 billion after five years. If that's indeed the case, investors can expect the stock to deliver outstanding gains once again over the coming five years.\nNvidia has a five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 20. As we are assuming that the company's revenue growth over the next five years can match the rate it has clocked in the past five, we can expect Nvidia to maintain its average sales multiple over the next five years as well. Based on a top line of $300 billion after five years, a sales multiple of 20 points toward a market cap of a whopping $6 trillion. That would be way higher than Nvidia's current market cap of around $1.35 trillion.\nHowever, Nvidia carries a discounted forward price-to-sales ratio of 14. Assuming a similar multiple after five years means that its market cap could increase to $4.2 trillion using the $300 billion revenue estimate. Again, that points toward a 3x jump in Nvidia's stock price over the next five years.\nAll this indicates that investors can expect Nvidia to jump substantially over the next five years and multiply their investments once again, making it a top growth stock to buy right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Is Selling $10 Billion in GPUs to This AI Tech Giant (Hint: It's Not Microsoft)",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock price has more than quadrupled over the past three years. Most of that rally was driven by the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, where its data center GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks.\nTwo of its better-known customers are OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and its top backer Microsoft. However, Meta (NASDAQ: META) has also been spending billions of dollars on Nvidia's data center GPUs every year.\nThat's why it wasn't all that surprising when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said his company would install 350,000 of Nvidia's top-tier H100 GPUs in its data centers by the end of 2024. Zuckerberg didn't disclose how many H100s Meta had purchased so far, but Nvidia only launched the GPU with a limited supply in late 2022.\nNvidia is currently selling the H100 for $25,000 to $30,000 each, according to analysts at Raymond James, which implies that Meta will probably spend roughly $8.8 billion to $10.5 billion on Nvidia's GPUs over a two-year period. Let's see why that's a bright green flag for Nvidia -- and what it tells us about Meta's near-term challenges and longer-term plans.\nNvidia generated $29.1 billion in revenue, or 75% of its top line, from its data center chips in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, which started last January. That's up from 52% of its total revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.\nThe bulls believe this business will continue expanding as the AI market grows, but the bears expect the AI market to cool off and for new competitors to enter the ring. Meta's big GPU purchases counter those bearish claims in two ways.\nFirst, Meta probably wouldn't spend about $10 billion -- equivalent to about 17% of its combined capital expenditures (capex) of $31 billion in 2023 and $28 billion in projected capex for 2024 -- on Nvidia's H100 GPUs if it thought the AI market was cooling off. Instead, the social media giant probably expects that market to heat up as cloud leaders including\u00a0Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google expand their own AI ecosystems.\nAccording to Precedence Research, the broader AI market could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% from 2023 to 2032. Fortune Business Insights expects the generative AI niche to expand at an even faster CAGR of 47.5%. Providing the building blocks for that booming market could drive Nvidia's stock a lot higher.\nSecond, Meta allays some concerns that Nvidia's largest customers will replace its GPUs with their own in-house chips. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have all been developing their own AI chips, but their ongoing purchases of Nvidia's GPUs suggest it could still be years before they produce comparable chips. Instead, their custom chips will probably work in tandem with Nvidia's GPUs to process AI tasks for the foreseeable future.\nBut for Meta, its massive purchases of Nvidia's GPUs raise some questions about its future. It's still burning billions of dollars on the expansion of its Reality Labs segment, which racked up steep operating losses of $13.7 billion in 2022 and $11.5 billion in the first nine months of 2023 as it rolled out new augmented and virtual reality devices. Its big GPU purchases from Nvidia could exacerbate that pressure -- which already reduced its operating margin from 41% in 2019 to 25% in 2022.\nMeta's revenue growth accelerated throughout 2023 as its core advertising business recovered, but that recovery was mainly driven by Chinese e-commerce marketplaces including PDD's Temu and Shein, which ramped up their spending on Meta's platforms to promote their products to overseas customers. If those companies rein in their ad purchases as Meta increases its spending on the expansion of its data centers and Reality Labs segment, its operating margin will shrink again.\nBut over the long term, Meta's data center investments could pay off by making its AI algorithms more effective at crafting targeted ads, figuring out which Reels keep viewers engaged, and calculating the best prices for its programmatic ads. Meta's collection of first-party data should also completely eliminate its dependence on Apple, which cut off Facebook and Instagram from its third-party iOS data with a major update in 2021.\nMeta's commitment to Nvidia indicates that the chipmaker will remain a linchpin of the AI market for years to come. It should boost Nvidia's data center GPU sales and widen Meta's own moat against other ad-driven tech giants such as Google. Simply put, this big GPU purchase is great news for both companies -- although Nvidia will initially generate more sales growth from that deal at the expense of Meta's near-term margins.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech stocks soared last year as excitement over burgeoning industries like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing made Wall Street bullish. The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index rose 67% throughout 2023, significantly improving from the year before when it plunged 40%. And the market has shown no signs of slowing, making 2024 an excellent time to expand your position in tech.\nNvidia was one of the biggest winners last year as it snapped up a majority market share in AI chips. Its stock is up 230% year over year, making it an attractive option for investing in AI and tech in general. However, some tech stocks were slightly overlooked last year and could offer more value than the chipmaker.\nSo, forget Nvidia. Here are two tech stocks to buy instead.\nAs the home of potent brands like Google, Android, and YouTube, it's impossible to deny Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) powerful role in tech.\nThe company's services attract billions of users, which it has used to build a lucrative digital advertising business. According to data from Statista, the digital ad market is projected to reach $740 billion in 2024, with Alphabet responsible for about 25% of the industry. Popular platforms like Google Search and YouTube present almost endless advertising opportunities for the company and have seen its earnings soar in recent years.\nSince 2019, Alphabet's annual revenue has risen 75%, with operating income up 108%, outperforming competitors Microsoft and Apple in both metrics.\nAdditionally, Alphabet's free cash flow has climbed 200% in the last five years to $78 billion, indicating the company has the cash reserves to invest heavily in its research and development and venture into new areas of tech -- such as AI.\nAlphabet is no stranger to AI. CEO Sundar Pichai recently described the company as seven years into its \"journey as an AI-first company,\" and it has ramped up its expansion in the market. In December, the tech giant unveiled its highly anticipated AI model, Gemini, which is expected to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4 and will likely offer Alphabet significant growth potential in AI.\nThese charts show Alphabet's stock is also significantly cheaper than Nvidia's. The company has lower figures in two key valuation metrics: forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios. Forward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, forward P/S divides its market cap by estimated revenue. For both metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value.\nForward P/E and P/S are great ways to determine the value of a company's shares as they take into account its financial health against its stock price. In this case, Alphabet is a far bigger bargain than Nvidia on both fronts. Alongside solid positions in multiple areas of tech, Alphabet is a no-brainer right now.\nDecades of almost unrivaled dominance in the chip industry saw Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) grow complacent, leaving it vulnerable to competition.\nBetween 2017 and 2023, its central processing unit (CPU) market share fell from 82% to 61%, while Advanced Micro Devices gradually grew in the sector. Then, in 2020, Intel lost one of its biggest customers when Apple ended a partnership between the tech companies in favor of in-house developed chips.\nHowever, rather than throwing in the towel, recent challenges have seemingly lit a fire under Intel again. The company ventured into the desktop graphics processing unit (GPU) market for the first time last year, diversifying its business with a larger role in PC gaming. Meanwhile, it is gearing up to launch a range of new AI chips that could threaten Nvidia's dominance over the long term.\nThe AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030 and surpass a value of $1 trillion before the decade's end. The sector's massive growth potential suggests Intel won't need to dethrone Nvidia to still see significant gains from AI, which strengthens its long-term outlook.\nLike Alphabet, Intel's stock offers far more value than Nvidia. The tables above show Intel's forward P/E and P/S ratios are substantially lower than its chip rival, making its stock less of a risk. Nvidia's meteoric rise last year has made it an expensive option. However, Intel remains a bargain with significant potential in tech.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) stocks hit an all-time high on Friday, as the AI craze continues to roll on in early 2024. Nvidia\u2019s share price jumped more than 2% to $584.87 as of midday. Shares of the AI juggernaut are up some 18% in the first few weeks of the new year and 179% over the last 12 months. And its market cap is quickly approaching $1.5 trillion.\nBut Nvidia isn\u2019t the only company benefiting from the AI hype. Rival AMD (AMD) hit an all-time intraday high on Thursday, topping out at $168.60 per share. The chipmaker is up 94% through the last 12 months. Shares of Intel (INTC) jumped 57% over the same period.\nNvidia got a huge vote of confidence on Thursday when Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company is spending billions of dollars to acquire thousands of Nvidia chips for its AI projects. In an Instagram Reels post, Zuckerberg said Meta will build out AI infrastructure complete with 350,000 Nvidia H100 chips by the end of 2024 with the goal of developing general artificial intelligence.\nZuckerberg also said he wants to make Meta\u2019s general AI open source, allowing others to use and work with it.\nNvidia is the world leader in AI chip development, with an estimated market share of between 70% and 90% of the global market. But it\u2019s not just Nvidia\u2019s hardware that helps it stay ahead of its rivals. The company\u2019s Cuda software, which developers use to create AI platforms, also serves as a moat that keeps Nvidia above the fray.\nThat said, Nvidia\u2019s rivals are gathering with the intent of snatching market share. In December, AMD debuted its MI300 accelerator, which is designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia\u2019s data center accelerators. Intel, meanwhile, is building out its own Gaudi3 AI accelerator, which will also compete with Nvidia\u2019s offerings.\nIt\u2019s not just AMD and Intel, though. Hyperscalers, which include cloud service providers Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), as well as Meta, are increasingly turning to chips they develop on their own to power their AI accelerators in the form of what are known as ASICs or application-specific integrated circuits.\nThink of AI graphics accelerators from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel as jacks of all trades. They can be used for a litany of different AI-related tasks, ensuring that whatever a company needs, the chips can handle it.\nASICs, on the other hand, are masters of a single trade. They\u2019re built specifically for a company\u2019s own AI needs and often are more efficient than the graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel.\nThat\u2019s a problem for Nvidia, as hyperscalers are huge spenders when it comes to AI GPUs. But as ASICs start to take hold, they may have less of a need for Nvidia\u2019s chips.\nStill, the AI explosion is only beginning. And the vast majority of companies that will benefit from AI have yet to get into the game. In other words, there\u2019s still plenty of room to grow. Even if Nvidia\u2019s market share takes a hit, its revenue will continue to increase as the AI space booms.\nFor now, though, Nvidia remains the AI king.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nNvidia (NVDA) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 39.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 268.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -2.8%.\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\nRight now, Nvidia has an S/TA ratio of 0.95, which means that the company gets $0.95 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.74, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Nvidia is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 118.4% this year versus the industry average of 5.2%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nvidia a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Over the past year, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the talk of the town and one of the stock market's best-performing large companies. The company designs the kind of advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) technology needed for artificial intelligence (AI). As a result, the GPU leader's revenue and earnings have been skyrocketing.\nSales surged 206% year over year in the company's third quarter, and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings rose 593%. With guidance for sales growth of roughly 231% in the fourth quarter, Nvidia expects the incredible momentum to continue in the near term.\nHowever, the combination of the company's explosive stock gains and the historically cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry suggests that Nvidia may be too hot for some investors to handle. Additionally, the company could see some uneven performance due to bans on advanced chip sales to China and upcoming performance comparisons to recent periods that likely benefited from Chinese customers frontloading GPU orders to get ahead of regulations.\nOver the long term, there's still a good chance that Nvidia will deliver strong returns. But another \"Magnificent Seven\" AI stock is offering a risk-reward profile that's probably a better fit for many investors.\nIf you've got your financial bases covered and are looking to invest $1,000 or more into a sturdy AI leader, read on to see why Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) stands out as the smartest buy right now.\nMicrosoft recently unseated Apple as the world's largest company as measured by market capitalization, although the two are going back and forth this month over who is on top (Apple currently has it). I think there's a very good chance that the software giant will regain and and then retain the title for much of the next decade. For investors seeking AI growth stocks backed by dependable businesses and strong competitive moats, Microsoft continues to be a great play.\nEven as it faced macroeconomic headwinds and one-time tax liabilities over the last year, Microsoft continued to post sales growth and strong profits. Now positive performance momentum is accelerating again.\nMicrosoft grew its revenue 13% year over year to reach $56.5 billion in its September-ended quarter. The company's operating income rose 25% year over year to hit $26.9 billion, and its net income jumped 27% to hit $22.3 billion.\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud infrastructure platform is at the heart of its surging profitability. AI developers are turning to the company's cloud offering to develop, launch, and scale their applications, and this tailwind is still just starting.\nMicrosoft is integrating AI into its operating systems and productivity software, and the company's Copilot software also makes it a frontrunner in the potentially explosive AI personal assistant space. Microsoft is even designing its own AI chips. Virtually every aspect of the tech leader's business looks poised to benefit from artificial intelligence.\nIn addition to its own internal projects, Microsoft also owns a substantial stake in OpenAI -- the company responsible for applications including ChatGPT and DALL-E. If you're looking for a well-rounded AI stock, Microsoft is tough to beat.\nAided by strong profitability, Microsoft has paid a dividend since 2003 and raised its payout annually for 18 years straight. While the company's current yield of roughly 0.7% won't be attractive to investors looking for big payouts right away, this is a dividend growth stock that's perfectly suited to be a set-it-and-forget-it portfolio component.\nMicrosoft's business is enormously profitable, and it has plenty of room for long-term expansion. In addition to sending the company's share price higher, profits generated on the back of AI should also help the company continue to increase the amount of cash that it returns to shareholders through dividends.\nWith strong business momentum, plenty of untapped AI opportunities, and an appealing returned income component, Microsoft is a top buy for investors seeking strong AI stocks.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company's sales are expected to grow 118.4% this year versus the industry average of 5.2%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nvidia a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California, has achieved significant financial gains from her recent investment in Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), a prominent company in artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductors. On Nov. 22, Pelosi acquired 50 call options for Nvidia with a strike price of $120, expiring on Dec. 20, 2024. The transaction value ranged between $1 million and $5 million\u200b\u200b.\nAs of early 2024, Pelosi has reportedly made nearly $500,000 from this investment, surpassing her annual government salary of approximately $223,500. This gain is attributed to Nvidia\u2019s stock performance, which has seen an increase of over 21% in value since Pelosi\u2019s acquisition\u200b\u200b, according to Finbold.\nDon't Miss:\nThis startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents \u2013 what\u2019s the catch?\nHere is where your most successful angel investment may be hidden.\nHow to achieve your boldest financial goals in 2024? These investors have the latest tips.\nPelosi\u2019s investment in Nvidia has drawn attention because of her track record of successful trades in Congress. Along with her husband, a venture capitalist, Pelosi has made substantial profits from trading call options in various blue-chip companies. However, her stock trades often face scrutiny, with some accusing her of using insider information to make lucrative trades\u200b\u200b.\nPelosi\u2019s investment decisions and their timing have been a topic of debate. While some criticize her for potential insider trading, others commend her strategic investment choices. The rise in Nvidia\u2019s stock value, partly because of the high demand for its chips in AI computing, has contributed significantly to Pelosi\u2019s recent financial success from this investment\u200b\u200b.\nNvidia has impacted sectors like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, semiconductors and gaming. Founded in 1993, the company has evolved from a primary focus on high-end gaming graphics processing units (GPUs) to a broad presence in autonomous vehicles and data centers.\nIn fiscal 2023, the company\u2019s financial performance was outstanding, with a third-quarter revenue of $18.1 billion and a net income of $9.2 billion. This success is largely because of its strategic focus on AI and accelerated computing, with key products like the H100 GPU and the Grace Hopper H200 AI Superchip. Nvidia\u2019s collaboration with Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Azure for cloud-based AI solutions and its significant data center revenue growth demonstrates its strong position in the tech industry\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\nNvidia\u2019s success and growth offer valuable insights and opportunities for startups. As Nvidia demonstrates, focusing on cutting-edge technologies and strategic collaborations can drive significant growth and market leadership. For startups, particularly those in tech industries, Nvidia\u2019s approach highlights the importance of innovation, adaptability and strategic partnerships.\nInvesting in startups offers the potential for significant financial returns, especially in high-growth sectors like technology and AI, akin to Nvidia\u2019s success in these fields.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nAverage retirement income in America has been revealed \u2013 Will you make enough each month?\nCopy and paste Mark Cuban\u2019s startup investment strategy according to his colorful portfolio.\nWhat decision made this 20-year-old a millionaire in 1 year?\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Nancy Pelosi Made $500,000 From Her Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Bet, Doubling Her Annual Government Salary In Just 2 Months originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "Nvidia's startup investments jumped 280% year-over-year, S&P Global reported.\nWhile its venture activity jumped, other tech giants largely pulled back investing.\nNvidia's blowout year provided it with a massive cash pile to unleash on AI-focused firms.\nNvidia's blowout performance last year has helped cement the firm as a rising star in corporate venturing, with the chipmaker's startup investments having nearly tripled in 2023, S&P Global reported on Tuesday.\nSpecifically, Nvidia's annual year-on-year investing has ballooned 280%, the agency calculated. That's in stark contrast to a broad retreat amid other tech giants, as leading firms such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta curbed their startup activity. In fact, the Facebook parent company suspended venture initiatives altogether in 2023.\nPullbacks also extend to other firms that are historically leaders in corporate venturing, such as SoftBank Group and Tencent Holdings. Only IBM and Amazon expanded investments, which grew 100% and 13% year-on-year.\nNvidia's participation in 38 funding rounds also made the semiconductor juggernaut the fourth-biggest corporate venture investor of the year. Ahead of it stand Microsoft, Softbank, and Alphabet.\nThe firm tunneled $872 million in non-affiliated firms in the first nine months, according to its third-quarter report. The total value of rounds surpasses $5 billion, S&P Global cited.\nIts rise in the space has been facilitated by the company's stellar stock and revenue outperformance in 2023. Nvidia's shares jumped roughly 225% through the year, as its chips have become an integral component of emerging artificial intelligence technology.\nWithin just two quarters, the company nearly tripled its revenues, hitting $18.1 billion for the year in the company's last earnings report. Investors are betting that Nvidia's product roadmap and more AI frenzy will only continue to boost growth.\nWith so much capital, this has allowed Nvidia to unleash its cash pile on smaller companies. The firm's 2022 termination of a deal to acquire Arm Holdings suggests that bigger M&A deals are off the table, S&P Global said.\nThe firm is largely interested in emerging technologies that propel it deeper into the AI space. Last year, it invested into 11 firms that deal with AI infrastructure, while also focusing on generative AI developers. Healthcare was also a bigger investing theme, with Nvidia focused on firms that apply AI in the sector.\nFor 2024, the chipmaker doesn't seem to be slowing down; its already announced three startup investments, S&P Global said.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Title": "Better Semiconductor Stock: Nvidia vs. AMD",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Semiconductor stocks have been in fine form on the market in the past year, which is evident from the 61% jump in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index, and this terrific jump has helped two of the index's constituents -- Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).\nWhile shares of Nvidia are up a terrific 252% in the past year, AMD has gained 128% over the same period. It won't be surprising to see both these semiconductor stocks sustaining their red-hot run in 2024, especially considering that the semiconductor industry is expected to accelerate nicely this year.\nMarket research firm Gartner estimates that global semiconductor revenue could increase 17% in 2024 to $624 billion. That would be a huge improvement over last year's decline of 11%, which was caused by the weakness in the smartphone and personal computer (PC) markets, as well as tepid spending in the enterprise data center market.\nSo, which of these two chipmakers is in a better position to capitalize on the semiconductor industry's growth in 2024? And, more importantly, is Nvidia or AMD is a better bet right now from a valuation perspective following their red-hot run last year? Let's find out.\nWhile the semiconductor market was down last year, the demand for chips deployed in artificial intelligence (AI) servers for training large language models (LLMs) remained robust. Nvidia rode this gravy train and is on track to finish the ongoing fiscal 2024 with $59 billion in revenue, which will be more than double the $27 billion revenue it generated in the previous fiscal year.\nThe good news for Nvidia investors is that the demand for AI chips is set to keep growing rapidly in the coming years. According to investment bank UBS, the market for AI graphics cards and chips could grow at an annual rate of 60% through 2027, generating an annual revenue of $165 billion. Nvidia is predicted to maintain a dominant 85% share of this booming AI chip market in 2024, according to Raymond James, which should lead to impressive growth in the company's data center revenue.\nRaymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri estimates that Nvidia's data center business could deliver $65 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025 (which begins next month). Nvidia has generated $29 billion in revenue from its data center business in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, which points toward an annual revenue of $39 billion based on the quarterly run rate.\nAccording to Raymond James' forecast, Nvidia's data center revenue could increase 66% in the new fiscal year. That won't be surprising, considering the solid demand for AI chips and Nvidia's share of this market. This, however, isn't the only side of the semiconductor market from which Nvidia stands to gain this year. The demand for the company's graphics cards that are deployed in gaming PCs (personal computers) should increase as well, thanks to a turnaround in this market and the adoption of AI-enabled computers.\nAll this indicates why Nvidia's total revenue is expected to jump a healthy 56% in fiscal 2025 to $92 billion. Even better, its earnings are expected to jump 66% in the upcoming fiscal year to $20.44 per share, giving growth-oriented investors a solid reason to keep buying this semiconductor stock.\nUnlike Nvidia, which gets 80% of its total revenue from selling data center chips, the majority of AMD's revenue comes from selling central processing units (CPUs), graphics cards, and semi-custom chips used in PCs and gaming consoles. For example, in the third quarter of 2023, the company got 51% of its total revenue from selling chips into these markets.\nThis is why the recovery in the PC market is going to be a key catalyst for AMD in 2024. Canalys is forecasting an 8% increase in PC shipments this year, a nice turnaround following last year's drop of 12%. Moreover, AMD has positioned itself to capitalize on the market for AI-enabled PCs with its CPUs that are powering such computers. This should unlock a solid long-term growth opportunity for AMD as sales of AI-powered PCs are expected to post annual growth of 50% through 2030, according to Counterpoint Research.\nHowever, AMD's gaming segment could continue to weigh on the company's performance. Its revenue from this segment was down 8% in the third quarter of 2023 due to tepid sales of its semi-custom chips, which are used by Microsoft and Sony in their popular gaming consoles. Given that the sales of gaming consoles are expected to increase by just 1.6% globally in 2024, AMD's gaming business may not get a big lift in 2024.\nAlso, Nvidia is the dominant player in gaming graphics cards with an 80% share, which means AMD isn't the best bet to capitalize on this market's growth. On the other hand, AMD's AI-focused business has yet to take off like that of Nvidia's. AMD is forecasting $2 billion in revenue from AI-related sales in 2024, which pales in comparison to Nvidia's revenue from this market.\nAll this tells us why AMD's growth is expected to be slower than Nvidia's. Analysts forecast its revenue to increase by 16.6% in 2024 to $26.4 billion, while earnings are forecast to increase by 41%. This relatively slower growth, however, isn't the only reason why Nvidia is looking like the better semiconductor stock of the two.\nThe points cited above make it clear that Nvidia is set to clock faster growth. But what makes Nvidia an even better bet over AMD is the valuation. As the following chart indicates, Nvidia is significantly cheaper than AMD as far as the forward and trailing earnings multiples are concerned.\nAs such, investors looking to benefit from the semiconductor market's growth this year and capitalize on hot trends such as AI would likely be better off buying Nvidia over AMD.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "As you probably know by now, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the stock of the year in 2023. The chipmaker traditionally known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) that have powered industries like gaming, crypto, and autonomous vehicles, has emerged as the clear leader in artificial intelligence (AI) chips as its technology is also well suited to running the kind of deep learning models that programs like ChatGPT require.\nAs a result, Nvidia reported skyrocketing growth throughout the year, which, not surprisingly, drove the stock to towering gains. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished 2023 up 239%. As you can see from the chart below, most of those gains came in the first half of the year as the fervor over generative AI reached a fever pitch.\nAs you can see from the chart, Nvidia stock steadily moved higher over the first quarter of the year as hype around ChatGPT and new generative AI technologies pushed a wave of tech stocks associated with AI higher.\nHowever, it wasn't until Nvidia's first-quarter earnings report in May that investors saw the surge in demand for its chips that had been set off by the launch of ChatGPT.\nNvidia beat estimates in the first-quarter report, and blew investors away with its guidance, calling for $11 billion in revenue for the second quarter, which compared to the analyst consensus of $7.2 billion. The stock jumped 24% on May 25 on the report, and Nvidia did not disappoint in its next two earnings reports as its momentum only increased.\nIn its second quarter, revenue jumped 101% year over year to $13.5 billion, well ahead of the company's guidance, and net income soared more than 800% to $6.2 billion.\nIn the third quarter, its results were even more impressive as revenue tripled to $18.1 billion and net income reached $9.2 billion, up more than 13 times from the year before.\nNvidia delighted investors with a number of new product and partnership announcements at the Consumer Electronics Show, and the stock has continued to gain even as other big tech and AI stocks have stalled.\nThere's still a shortage for Nvidia's products and the company seems to have a wide technological lead over the competition. That should bode well for the stock, and shares look surprisingly affordable at a forward P/E of 27. The AI stock looks like a good bet to keep moving higher in 2024.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +24.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 19.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $4.49 per share, indicating a change of +410.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.31 points to a change of +268.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.07 indicates a change of +63.1% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $20.1 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +232.2%. The $58.92 billion and $90.57 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +118.4% and +53.7%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNvidia reported revenues of $18.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +205.5%. EPS of $4.02 for the same period compares with $0.58 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +11.9%. The EPS surprise was +19.64%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "2 Reasons to Be Bullish About Nvidia in 2024",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) just completed one of its best years since its founding almost 30 years ago. Increased interest in artificial intelligence (AI) sent demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) soaring, and its hardware dominated the AI market. As a result, the tech giant's stock rose nearly 240% in 2023.\nNvidia is starting the new year with a majority market share in AI chips, one of the world's fastest-growing and most lucrative industries. Despite its meteoric rise over the last 12 months, the chipmaker has shown no signs of slowing and continues to be an attractive investment.\nSo here are two reasons to be bullish about Nvidia in 2024.\nMacroeconomic headwinds hit the tech market hard in 2022, triggering a sell-off that pulled the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index down by 40% that year. However, easing inflation and excitement over budding sectors like AI saw the industry begin to recover in 2023, and it will likely continue improving in the new year.\nAccording to Gartner, PC shipments fell 16% in 2022 as consumers who had purchased new computers early in the pandemic had little motivation to upgrade, and as inflation and rising interest rates took a toll on discretionary spending. That figure improved to a 9% decline in the third quarter of 2023, with quarterly results from multiple companies suggesting that a recovery in the market was on the way.\nNvidia classifies much of its PC-related sales under its gaming segment, as its hardware is used by consumers to build high-powered gaming computers. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter, which ended Oct. 29, this segment posted revenue growth of 81% year over year and 15% sequentially.\nThe PC market has been a weak point for Nvidia for much of the last two years. However, the worst declines appear to be in the past, and the company is starting 2024 with a booming AI business and a return to growth in its PC segment.\nWhile companies like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel spent years prioritizing the central processing unit market (CPU), Nvidia made GPUs its specialty. So when companies across tech pivoted their businesses to AI last year and demand for GPUs to power those applications soared, Nvidia was perfectly placed to snap up an estimated 90% share of the market in AI chips.\nNvidia's skyrocketing chip sales were reflected in its fiscal 2024 Q3 report: Revenue rose 206% year over year, and operating income was up 1,600%. Increased demand for AI GPUs lifted the company's data center revenue by 279% for the quarter.\nWhile Nvidia profited from a relative lack of chip competition last year, that looks likely to change in 2024. AMD and Intel will begin shipping new AI chips in the coming months, which has some investors concerned about the chipmaker's prospects for this year.\nHowever, Grand View Research projects that the AI market will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. If that proves accurate, the industry's market size would exceed $1 trillion before the end of the decade, suggesting there's plenty of room for Nvidia to hold onto its dominance even as new competitors appear.\nMoreover, Nvidia has held a market share of over 80% in desktop GPUs for years, even while AMD and Intel have grown their footprints in the sector. It has been challenging for rivals to chip away at Nvidia's lead in that niche, and it is unlikely to be different in AI.\nNvidia continues to have massive potential in 2024 and beyond, with its positions at the top of AI and in a recovering PC business. Its potential is backed up by this chart, which shows its EPS estimates until its fiscal 2026.\nAccording to the data, Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share. Multiplying that figure by the tech giant's current forward price-to-earnings ratio of 40 yields a stock price of $960 -- 94% higher than its position today.\nBased on that outlook, Nvidia's stock is one of the smartest buys for 2024.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was one of the top stocks in 2023, rising 239%. While some thought this may have been Nvidia's ceiling, that has been far from the truth. In just under a month in 2024, Nvidia has already risen 21%, giving the impression that 2024 could be a repeat year for the stock.\nHowever, much of the optimism baked into the stock ignores an ugly truth about Nvidia that many people forget: It's a cyclical company. So, what can investors expect in the next few years? Let's take a look at what history says.\nNvidia has done so well over the past year because it makes the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) suited for artificial intelligence (AI). Originally, GPUs were created to improve gaming graphics, which required significant computing power. Soon, the use of GPUs for other arduous computing tasks like AI model training, engineering simulations, drug discovery, and mapping the human genome would be sped up by using hundreds or thousands of GPUs connected together.\nBecause of the AI arms race, many companies raced to build supercomputers to train their AI models. This fueled Nvidia's growth and resulted in Nvidia's revenue more than tripling year over year in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Oct. 29, 2023). However, many people forget that Nvidia was in a massive slump at the start of 2023, as its cyclical nature reared its head throughout 2022.\nAnother use for Nvidia's GPUs is cryptocurrency mining. This industry has had two major boom-and-bust cycles, one at the start of 2018 and the other during 2021. When crypto prices fall, mining cryptocurrency becomes unprofitable, as the input costs far outweigh the output. As a result, crypto miners don't purchase as many GPUs (or purchase none at all), which affects Nvidia's business significantly.\nIn the years following a crypto crash, Nvidia saw its revenue dip.\nWhen Nvidia's revenue dips, it isn't optimized for profits, so its earnings fall even more dramatically.\nSo, what does this have to do with today's AI-fueled GPU purchasing?\nBecause GPUs are hardware, they don't need to be purchased continually. While many companies are still outfitting their supercomputers, others have already built theirs.\nTake Tesla's Dojo computer, for example. It required 10,000 H100 GPUs from Nvidia and likely cost more than $300 million in GPUs alone, with the average price of an H100 GPU being about $30,000. Will Tesla need to build another Dojo computer each year? Likely not.\nThis could cause Nvidia's downfall in the next few years: Customers won't need to buy GPUs continuously.\u00a0However, the problem with this analysis is that I have no idea when this will occur or how low the demand will fall.\nNvidia's previous cyclical declines only brought the revenue down around 20%. If Nvidia is still slated to double from its current levels, then even if business falls 20% once demand has been satisfied, the stock still has room for more upside. On the other hand, if the business will fall 20% from current levels, the stock is currently overvalued.\nAdditionally, 20% may be a conservative number, as once these companies build out their infrastructure, they may be set for many years.\nI have no idea when Nvidia's business will top out and how far it will go when business declines. But I know that it's coming. With how fully valued the company is today (160 times earnings), investors need to be careful if they're taking a position in the stock at today's prices.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "Text": "The graphics card market is no longer a duopoly. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) launched its first discrete family of graphics cards in late 2022. While the launch was bumpy, the company managed to offer a compelling value proposition for gamers in the budget portion of the market.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is still the market leader by far, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is in a distant second place. Intel has gained a small foothold, but only in the budget portion of the market. The company's issues with buggy software drivers, particularly soon after launch, have likely driven some gamers away.\nIntel's first generation of graphics cards made no attempt to compete with Nvidia and AMD at higher price points. The Arc A750 sells today for around $210, and the Arc A770 goes for around $320, although prices have dipped lower at times. These cards are competitive for the price, although performance can be inconsistent due to nagging driver issues.\nHelping Intel in 2023 were lackluster mid-range graphics card launches from both Nvidia and AMD. Nvidia's RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti came with limitations and high price tags. Tom's Hardware concluded that the priciest variant was \"overpriced for what you get, much like most of the rest of Nvidia's current RTX 40-series lineup.\"\nAMD's efforts weren't much better. The RX 7600 wasn't much of an upgrade over previous models, and the value proposition, compared to last-gen products, was weak, even after a last-minute price cut.\nWhile Nvidia is expected to roll out a product refresh soon, genuinely new mid-range graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD likely won't be coming until 2025. The gap between Nvidia's RTX 3060 and RTX 4060 was more than two years, and the RTX 4060 has only been on the market since mid-2023. AMD may fill in some gaps in its lineup in 2024, but next-generation products are likely a ways off.\nIntel's next-generation graphics cards, codenamed Battlemage, are expected to arrive sometime in 2024. With Battlemage, Intel is expected to move up into the enthusiast portions of the market that its first-generation products avoided. While Intel probably won't be going toe-to-toe with Nvidia's highest-end products, Battlemage should appeal to a broader swath of gamers.\nIntel proved with its first-generation products that it can produce capable graphics hardware. With its second-generation products, it must prove that it's committed enough to the market to continually improve its software and eliminate the bugs and inconsistencies that have been holding it back.\nJon Peddie Research expects the market for discrete graphics cards to grow to $39 billion by 2026. That estimate was thrown out in late 2022 before the artificial intelligence (AI) bonanza caused demand for data center GPUs to explode. Considering just the market for graphics cards aimed at gaming, however, that's likely still a reasonable estimate.\nIn addition to winning a portion of the graphics card market, Intel's increased work on graphics can benefit it in other ways. The company's Meteor Lake CPUs, which launched in December for laptops, feature revamped integrated GPUs that deliver enormous performance gains. One set of benchmarks, for example, shows a 33% performance gain and a doubling of power efficiency over previous-generation models. Intel has long lagged AMD in terms of integrated graphics performance, but that gap now appears to be closing.\nWhile Intel's initial graphics card launch didn't go smoothly, the software situation has greatly improved over the past year. Whenever the company manages to get Battlemage out the door, it will be in a good position to increase its market share and cement its status as a viable alternative to Nvidia and AMD.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Intel wasn't one of them.

        "Author": "  Avi Kapoor ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation  (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares closed slightly higher during Monday\u2019s session.\nThe company is expected to release earnings results for the recent quarter next month, with analysts anticipating quarterly earnings at $4.50 per share on revenue of $20.18 billion.\nNvidia, meanwhile, is looking to boost its AI chip sales in India significantly through a deal with Yotta, an Indian data center operator. The $500 million deal brings Nvidia's total orders from Yotta to $1 billion, marking a substantial increase in Yotta's AI cloud services.\nSunil Gupta, CEO and co-founder of Yotta shared that the order includes nearly 16,000 Nvidia H100 and GH200 AI chips, with delivery expected by March 2025, Reuters reported.\nWith the recent buzz around Nvidia, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company\u2019s dividends. As of now, Nvidia has a dividend yield of 0.03%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 4 cents a share (16 cents a year).\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Nvidia dividends, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Nvidia\u2019s $0.16 dividend: $6,000 / $0.16 = 37,500 shares\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $22,370,250 worth of Nvidia, or 37,500 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.16 = 7,500 shares, or $4,474,050 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\nView more earnings on NVDA\nAlso Read:\u00a0Top 4 Consumer Stocks That May Collapse This Month\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\nNVDA Price Action: Shares of Nvidia gained 0.3% to close at $596.54 on Monday.\nRead More: This Jeff Bezos-backed platform has made real estate investing as easy as ordering stuff on Amazon.

        "Title": "Better AI Stock: Nvidia vs. Intel",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market has captivated Wall Street, with increased interest in the technology being a major driver in the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's 53% year-over-year rise. Investors have become particularly bullish about chip stocks, homing in on the companies developing the hardware necessary for training and running AI models.\nAs a result, shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have soared about 204% and 53% since last January. These companies are poised to see significant gains over the long term as demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) continues to rise alongside AI market growth.\nNvidia is an attractive option as one of the most established companies in AI, with its estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI GPUs. However, Intel is at an earlier stage in its AI expansion, which could indicate it has more room to run.\nSo, let's examine these chipmakers more closely and determine whether Nvidia or Intel is the better AI stock this month.\nNvidia's years of dominance in GPUs gave it a head start in AI. As rivals Intel and Advanced Micro Devices scrambled to catch up last year, Nvidia was well equipped to immediately begin supplying its chips to the entire AI market. Consequently, the company's earnings and stock skyrocketed, with Nvidia becoming the first chipmaker to exceed a market cap of $1 trillion.\nThis chart reflects Nvidia's meteoric rise over the last year. As chip sales have skyrocketed, so has the company's quarterly revenue, operating income, and free cash flow. Competition in the AI GPU market is expected to heat up this year as Intel and AMD begin shipping their own offerings.\nHowever, Nvidia's $17 billion in free cash flow indicates it has the funds to continue expanding in AI and defend its dominance. For reference, Intel's free cash flow is negative $14 billion, while AMD's is just over $1 billion.\nDespite Nvidia's significant gains last year, the company likely still has much to offer new investors. The AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, with demand for GPUs likely to continue rising for the foreseeable future.\nIntel's stock has fallen 12% since Jan. 25, when it released its fourth-quarter 2023 earnings results. The company posted revenue growth of 10% year over year, beating Wall Street estimates by $230 million as it benefited from an improving PC market.\nHowever, that wasn't enough to overshadow weak guidance that sent Intel's stock tumbling. The company expects its first-quarter 2024 earnings to come in at $0.13 per share; analysts had forecast $0.42 per share.\nIntel has hit some roadblocks, but poor guidance illustrates why keeping a long-term perspective is crucial when investing in budding industries like AI.\nLast December, Intel unveiled a range of AI chips, including Gaudi3, a GPU designed to challenge Nvidia's and AMD's offerings. The tech giant also showcased new Core Ultra processors and Xeon server chips, both of which include neural processing units for running AI programs more efficiently.\nThe good news about the AI market's CAGR of 37% is that it suggests Intel won't need to dethrone Nvidia to still carve out a lucrative role in the space. That trajectory would see the industry surpass $1 trillion well before 2030, indicating there will be plenty of room for Intel to still see significant boosts to revenue.\nNvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 50 compared to Intel's 32 makes it the far more expensive stock. Forward P/E is a helpful valuation metric calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. And the lower the figure, the better the value.\nMoreover, this chart shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Intel's may reach nearly $3 per share. Multiplying these figures by each company's forward P/E yields a stock price of $1,200 for Nvidia and $93 for Intel.\nConsidering their current positions, these projections would see Nvidia's stock rise 93% by its fiscal 2026 and Intel's increase by 116%. On this basis alone, Intel looks like the better AI stock. Intel offers more value and potentially has more room for growth in the coming years.\nHowever, Nvidia's growth potential is still significant, with a far more established role in AI and a financially healthier business. Its stock could be the more reliable play if you're willing to pay its premium price tag.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) is surfing the AI wave into CES 2024 with the debut of its GeForce RTX 40 Super series of desktop graphics cards. The lineup, which is made up of the high-end RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, is primarily designed for gaming, but Nvidia is also pitching it as cadre of AI powerhouses.\nThe RTX 4080 Super starts at $999 and is 1.4x faster than the RTX 3080 Ti. The RTX 4070 Ti Super, meanwhile, is 1.6x faster than the RTX 3070 Ti. But, according to the company, those performance gains jump significantly when you add in Nvidia's AI-powered Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS).\nWith DLSS, the RTX 4080 Super is twice as fast as the RTX 3080 Ti, while the RTX 4070 Ti Super is 2.5x faster than the RTX 3070 Ti with DLSS. Even the RTX 4070 Super gets a big boost with DLSS, with 1.5x better performance than the RTX 3090.\nThat's a lot of names and numbers, but suffice it to say, these cards are going to offer gamers a sizable upgrade over Nvidia's prior generation of desktop graphics processing units (GPUs).\nBut Nvidia is also framing these cards as powerful options for AI PCs, the new class of laptops and desktops designed to run AI applications natively rather than in the cloud. Nvidia joins AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) in the push to drive AI PCs into the consumer and enterprise landscape.\nThe idea behind AI PCs is that they will allow consumers and business users to access generative AI apps from their own devices, which should ensure that their private data isn't uploaded to the cloud or used to train AI software. But Intel and AMD have admitted that they're still waiting to see what kinds of programs and platforms developers come up with that take advantage of AI PC features.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) is so dedicated to the concept of the AI PC that it and its manufacturing partners are adding dedicated Copilot AI assistant keys to Windows laptop and desktop keyboards.

The Orlando-based startup counts enterprise customers including Coca-Cola Co., Airbus SE and Roche Holding AG, it said. LG Electronics Inc. runs its chatbot to support online shoppers for its products.\nNvidia, an existing Kore.ai backer before its latest round, has struck a number of deals with up-and-coming AI firms over the past year, including investments in Hugging Face, Cohere and Mistral AI. Nvidia, whose chips are fundamental to the training and development of generative AI, is among those betting on the technology\u2019s potential since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT debuted more than a year ago. It\u2019s made over a dozen investments in AI startups in 2023 alone, mainly in companies that build using its sophisticated processors.\nIts backing is an endorsement for Kore.ai, which is counting on AI going mainstream among enterprises looking to automate their business. It currently automates 450 million daily interactions involving about 200 million consumers, and is headed for an initial public offering, the company said.\nKore.ai\u2019s revenue has grown at triple-digit percentages in past years, founder and Chief Executive Officer Raj Koneru told Bloomberg News, without divulging specifics. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the scale and process in place to be able to have an IPO in about two years,\u201d he said.\nKoneru, who was born in India, founded the Orlando, Florida-based company in 2014.

        "Author": "  Ian King ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp., whose chip technology dominates in data centers used to create artificial intelligence software, announced new products to help the personal computer industry lure consumers with \u201cAI PCs.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nGoogle Lays Off Hundreds in Hardware, Assistant, Engineering\nSEC Authorizes Bitcoin-Spot ETFs in Crypto\u2019s Breakthrough\nUK\u2019s Sunak Authorizes Joint Military Strikes With US Against Houthis\nThese Are the World\u2019s Most Powerful Passports in 2024\nHertz to Sell 20,000 EVs in Shift Back to Gas-Powered Cars\nNvidia unveiled three new desktop graphics chips with extra components that will let gamers, designers and other computer users make better use of AI on their personal machines without having to rely on remote services accessed over the internet. The chips, updated versions of existing offerings, will be offered at a \u201cgreat new price,\u201d the company said Monday in a presentation at the CES trade show.\nNvidia rivals Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have already touted what they say is a new era for the industry: AI PCs. The companies argue that AI software is more secure and responsive when it\u2019s run on the PCs themselves rather than over the internet. Nvidia now claims its graphics chips are the best engines to power the new types of laptops and desktops.\nThe new GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER will get more processing cores and faster memory. It can run Stable Diffusion XL image generation software 1.7 times faster than the equivalent model from the previous generation of Nvidia technology, the company said. The new chip will also power games with ray tracing \u2014 building an image by calculating the path of individual rays of light \u2013 at 4K resolution.\nThe product is scheduled to go on sale Jan. 31 for $999. The company also unveiled an RTX 4070 Ti SUPER for $799 and a 4070 Super for $599, which will be available later this month.\nPaired with new software and optimizations of AI models that Nvidia is also releasing, the products will offer an \u201corder of magnitude\u201d improvement over machines that are powered by Intel chips, according to Justin Walker, an Nvidia vice president.\nNvidia\u2019s stock rose as much as 5% in New York trading Monday, taking it back above $500 a share to a record high. The stock more than tripled last year, giving the company a market value of more than $1 trillion.\nAfter a spike in sales during the pandemic, PC shipments have fallen steeply, leaving makers and component suppliers burdened with inventory and little growth. Nvidia has avoided the worst of the PC plunge by owning the market for accelerator chips used to create AI software in data centers. The explosion in demand for that more expensive type of chip has pushed Nvidia\u2019s market value past $1 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the history of the semiconductor industry.\nFor computer chipmakers in general, though, the majority of the volume they ship still goes into PCs. They\u2019re searching for a way to persuade laptop owners and corporate buyers to upgrade their equipment and have begun touting AI capabilities as a reason for new purchases.\nNvidia said the new chips will provide more realistic gaming with high-definition images enhanced by AI, which will also generate improved dialog by in-game characters. In another example, the products will provide more responsive tools for image-editing software from companies such as Adobe Inc. There are currently 500 applications that are tuned to work better with AI and Nvidia\u2019s RTX technology, the company said.\nNvidia is the largest maker of graphics processors, or GPUs. Gamers are willing to pay thousands of dollars for cards that upgrade their experience, which make the company\u2019s chips a premium addition to PCs. Nvidia\u2019s main rival in that market is AMD. Intel and AMD also offer central processing units that have graphics capabilities.\nSeparately, Nvidia said the capabilities of its new products won\u2019t trigger rules put in place by the US government to limit the export of AI-related chips to China. The top-of-the-line GTX 4090 already fell afoul of those restrictions, requiring Nvidia to produce a less-capable version for that market.\n(Updates with chart after fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerberg\u2019s Top Priority\nTrumponomics 2.0: What to Expect If Trump Wins the 2024 Election\nUS Is Weaponizing New Economic Tools to Slow China\u2019s War Machine\nFive ETFs to Watch in 2024\nKim Kardashian\u2019s Skims Isn\u2019t the Only Celebrity Brand to Watch\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "China's military and government acquire Nvidia chips despite US ban",
        "Author": "  Eduardo Baptista ",
        "Text": "By Eduardo Baptista\nBEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese military bodies, state-run artificial intelligence research institutes and universities have over the past year purchased small batches of Nvidia semiconductors banned by the U.S. from export to China, a Reuters review of tender documents show.\nThe sales by largely unknown Chinese suppliers highlight the difficulties Washington faces, despite its bans, in completely cutting off China's access to advanced U.S. chips that could fuel breakthroughs in AI and sophisticated computers for its military.\nBuying or selling high-end U.S. chips is not illegal in China and the publicly available tender documents show dozens of Chinese entities have bought and taken receipt of Nvidia semiconductors since restrictions were imposed.\nThese include its A100 and the more powerful H100 chip - whose exports to China and Hong Kong were banned in September 2022 - as well as the slower A800 and H800 chips Nvidia then developed for the Chinese market but which were also banned last October.\nThe graphic processing units - a type of chip - that are built by Nvidia are widely seen as far superior to rival products for AI work as they can more efficiently process huge amounts of data needed for machine-learning tasks.\nThe continued demand for and access to banned Nvidia chips also underlines the lack of good alternatives for Chinese firms despite the nascent development of rival products from Huawei and others. Prior to the bans, Nvidia commanded a 90% share of China's AI chip market.\nPurchasers included elite universities as well as two entities subject to U.S. export restrictions - the Harbin Institute of Technology and the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, which have been accused of involvement in military matters or being affiliated to a military body contrary to U.S. national interest.\nThe former purchased six Nvidia A100 chips in May to train a deep-learning model. The latter purchased one A100 in December 2022. Its purpose was not identified.\nNone of the purchasers mentioned in this article responded to requests for comment.\nThe Reuters review found neither Nvidia nor retailers approved by the company were among the suppliers identified. It was not clear how the suppliers have procured their Nvidia chips.\nIn the wake of U.S. curbs, however, an underground market for such chips in China has sprung up. Chinese vendors have previously said they snatch up excess stock that finds its way to the market after Nvidia ships large quantities to big U.S. firms, or import through companies locally incorporated in places such as India, Taiwan and Singapore.\nReuters sought comment from 10 of the suppliers listed in tender documents including those mentioned in this article - none of them answered.\nNvidia said it complies with all applicable export control laws and requires its customers to do the same.\n\"If we learn that a customer has made an unlawful resale to third parties, we'll take immediate and appropriate action,\" a company spokesperson said.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce declined to comment. U.S. authorities have vowed to close loopholes in the export restrictions and have moved to limit access to the chips by units of Chinese companies located outside China.\nChris Miller, professor at Tufts University and author of \"Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology\", said it was unrealistic to think U.S. export restrictions could be watertight given that chips are small and can easily be smuggled.\nThe main aim is \"to throw sand in the gears of China's AI development\" by making it difficult to build large clusters of advanced chips capable of training AI systems, he added.\nThe review includes more than 100 tenders where state entities have procured A100 chips and dozens of tenders since the October ban show purchases of the A800.\nTenders published last month also show Tsinghua University procured two H100 chips while a laboratory run by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology procured one.\nThe buyers include one unnamed People's Liberation Army entity based in the city of Wuxi, Jiangsu province, according to tenders from a military database. It sought 3 A100 chips in October and one H100 chip this month.\nMilitary tenders in China are often heavily redacted and Reuters was not able to learn who won the bids or the reason for the purchase.\nMost tenders show the chips are being used for AI. The quantities of most purchases are, however, very small, far from what's needed to build a sophisticated AI large language model from scratch.\nA model similar to OpenAI's GPT would require more than 30,000 Nvidia A100 cards, according to research firm TrendForce. But a handful can run complex machine-learning tasks and enhance existing AI models.\nIn one example, the Shandong Artificial Intelligence Institute awarded a 290,000 yuan ($40,500) contract for 5 A100 chips to Shandong Chengxiang Electronic Technology last month.\nMany of the tenders stipulate suppliers have to deliver and install the products before receiving payment. Most universities also published notices showing the transaction was completed.\nTsinghua University, dubbed China's Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is a prolific issuer of tenders and has purchased some 80 A100 chips since the 2022 ban.\nIn December, Chongqing University published a tender for one A100 chip that explicitly stated it could not be second-hand or disassembled but had to be \"brand new\". The delivery was completed this month, a notice showed.\n($1 = 7.1592 Chinese yuan)\n(Reporting by Eduardo Baptista; Additional reporting by Josh Ye in Hong Kong and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n"

        "Text": "By Stephen Nellis\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Data center operator Equinix and Nvidia said on Wednesday they had partnered up to offer the chip firm's supercomputing systems to corporate clients.\nThe service will make it easier for companies to own artificial intelligence computing systems and have better control over their data, instead of renting out Nvidia's market-leading chips from cloud computing providers like Amazon.com or Microsoft.\nMany large businesses have shown interest in owning their AI computing system for privacy and security reasons, but Nvidia systems are different from conventional data center servers, often using different networking cabling and sometimes employing liquid cooling.\nUnder the deal, Nvidia has trained Equinix staff in how to build and run its systems. Corporate customers will purchase Nvidia systems but pay Equinix to build and run them efficiently while still retaining ownership.\n\"We want to drive privacy because what we're hearing at large customers is they are very worried about controlling their own destiny,\" Jon Lin, executive vice president and general manager of data center services at Equinix, told Reuters in an interview.\nHowever, \"being able to then figure out how to operate (AI data centers) efficiently and effectively - this is an entirely new set of capabilities that is not generally available.\"\nNvidia and Equinix said the new offering is available as of Wednesday but did not disclose any immediate customers.\n(This story has been corrected to clarify that liquid cooling is not a requirement for Nvidia systems in paragraph 3)\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 January 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Coinbase Global Inc. COIN, Block Inc. SQ, Interactive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR and CME Group Inc.'s CME.\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nThe cryptocurrency market witnessed an impressive turnaround in 2023 after a highly disappointing 2022. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency worldwide, soared 157% last year. Other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) also saw massive price hikes.\nThe space is likely to remain buoyant in 2024. U.S. stock markets have soared amid a clear indication from the Fed's December FOMC meeting that the current interest rate hike cycle, which elevated the Fed fund rate to a 22-year high of 5.25-5.50% from 0-0.25% in March 2022, has finally ended. Moreover, the December FOMC meeting dot-plot showed that on average, Fed officials are expecting at least three rate cuts of 25 basis points each in 2024.\nA lower interest rate regime will be very helpful for high-growth sectors like technology and cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the largest thrust for the crypto space has come from institutional investors.\nSpeculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission is set to approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has also raised investors' optimism. The agency is expected to respond to the application filed by ARK Investments and 21Shares by Jan 10, while financial major BlackRock Inc.'s proposal is expected to be addressed by Mar 15.\nMoreover, the next Bitcoin Halving will occur in the first half of 2024. When a halving occurs, the reward for mining new blocks is halved, making it more challenging for miners to earn net Bitcoins. Historically, this event has led to increased scarcity and has driven up the value of Bitcoin due to reduced supply.\nWe have narrowed our search to five crypto-centric stocks with strong potential for 2024.\nNVIDIA Corp. is a semiconductor industry giant and one of the biggest success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the NVDA stock usually soars on a booming crypto market. This is because GPUs are pivotal to data centers, artificial intelligence, and the creation of crypto assets.\nNVIDIA's expected earnings growth rate for next year is 62% (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its next-year earnings has improved 1% over the past 30 days. NVDA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nCoinbase Global Inc. provides financial infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy in the United States and internationally. COIN offers the primary financial account in the crypto space for consumers, a marketplace with a pool of liquidity for transacting in crypto assets for institutions; and technology and services that enable developers to build crypto-based applications and securely accept crypto assets as payment.\nCoinbase Global has an expected earnings growth rate of 30.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.7% over the past 30 days. COIN currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\nBlock Inc. is an online digital and mobile payment platform for consumers and merchants and is the parent company of Square and Cash App. The users of Cash App can buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin. In addition, SQ's decentralized tbd platform allows developers to build decentralized finance applications to run on programmable blockchains. SQ is also one of the largest Bitcoin investors.\nBlock has an expected earnings growth rate of 53.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.5% over the past 60 days. SQ currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nInteractive Brokers Group Inc.is a global automated electronic broker. IBKR executes, processes and trades in cryptocurrencies. IBKR's commodities futures trading desk also offers customers a chance to trade cryptocurrency futures.\nInteractive Brokers Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 5.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.7% over the past 90 days. IBKR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\nCME Group Inc.'s options give the buyer of the call/put the right to buy/sell cryptocurrency futures contracts at a specific price at some future date. CME offers bitcoin and ether options based on the exchange's cash-settled standard and micro BTC and ETH futures contracts.\nCME Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 3.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the past 30 days. CME currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were moving higher today after investors responded well to a series of announcements at CES today, which included new chips for generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, PCs and gaming, and new partnerships.\nAs a result, the stock was up 5.4% as of 2:34 p.m. ET.\nThe AI stock rose quickly this morning even before its CES presentation as investors anticipated good news.\nDuring its presentation, Nvidia unveiled a slew of new chips, including new desktop graphics chips to make it easier to use AI on a PC. The company also announced new GeForce RTX graphics cards, which offer 4K resolution and ray tracing, meaning they can create an image by tracking individual rays of light.\nNvidia said these new components were an \"order of magnitude\" better than computers powered by Intel chips. Nvidia hasn't traditionally been a major player in the large market for PC chips, but these new releases and its prowess in AI could help it gain market share in that subsector of the semiconductor industry.\nAdditionally, Nvidia announced new partnerships with companies like Amgen to use Nvidia's generative AI tools for drug discovery and data insights; Getty Images, which will use Nvidia's Picasso for a new image generation service, and with autonomous vehicle developers such as Li Auto.\nNvidia is clearly in the driver's seat in the AI race after its revenue more than tripled in its most recent quarter, and the company is unlikely to relinquish that leading position without a fight. Today's news shows that Nvidia has no intention of slowing down and will continue to innovate and launch breakthrough products.\nIf you're looking for an AI stock to own, Nvidia still seems like a no-brainer.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) Still Looks Cheap Near Highs. Here\u2019s Why",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has managed to pull it off again, recently surging to hit new highs after many months of consolidating the explosive gains from last year. It may be hard to believe, but the stock\u2019s valuation still doesn\u2019t seem all that absurd. Undoubtedly, it took a few fantastic quarters for the semiconductor kingpin to grow into its lofty multiple. Given the pace of growth (which shows no signs of grinding to a slowdown) and its market leadership, I have to maintain a bullish stance.\nWith the generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom still heating up (one could argue it\u2019s still in the early innings), there\u2019s a good chance Nvidia could prove the \u201cvalue crowd\u201d wrong as sales not only meet today\u2019s high slate of expectations but exceed them.\nIt\u2019s not a mystery why Wall Street still views NVDA stock as a Buy. I think it\u2019s hard to be anything but bullish if you recognize the massive demand potential for next-generation chips as nascent technologies like generative AI, the metaverse, and self-driving (and electric) vehicles come onto the scene.\nFurther, the company\u2019s ability to stay in the lead as new entrants give it their all to take a bit of share leaves me incredibly encouraged and perhaps willing to pay up a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple north of 72 times for the $1.35 trillion chip juggernaut.\nFor 2024, the analyst community is continuing to pound the table, with few highlighting valuation as an issue, at least compared to many of its AI rivals who\u2019ve suffered downgrades following last year\u2019s hot tech surge.\nOppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer has a Buy rating on Nvidia stock, with a $650.00 price target, which entails 18.6% in gains for the year ahead. Schafer isn\u2019t just bullish on Nvidia stock for 2024; he views it as one of his \u201ctop 2024 picks\u201d to bet on AI.\nWhat could help power the next leg of gains for Nvidia? Schafer views Nvidia\u2019s B100 GPU \u2014 an AI chip that reportedly will double the performance of its H200 chip \u2014 as a potential catalyst once it\u2019s released this year. Those are some serious performance gains that could help Nvidia gain even more ground over its chip peers. In many ways, Nvidia seems to be sprinting in the AI race as many of its competitors merely jog.\nIt\u2019s tough to make an argument that a stock going for more than 70 times trailing P/E is undervalued. Looking at the forward P/E multiple one year out (currently at 27.5 times, just 25% more than the semiconductor industry average of 21.8 times), though, it becomes more apparent that Nvidia is delivering on the earnings growth front, perhaps sooner than many skeptics may have anticipated.\nPerhaps Nvidia\u2019s generational growth prospects warrant an even higher price tag and certainly a greater premium over the peer group.\nI\u2019ll admit that I was one of the Nvidia skeptics who questioned the stock\u2019s sky-high multiple and the firm\u2019s abilities to meet what I thought were absurdly high expectations. I\u2019ve since changed my tune, given Nvidia\u2019s ability to deliver chips that outdo predecessors by leaps and bounds.\nFurther, the AI arms race could stand to heat up again as firms get serious about having the very best hardware to power their AI models. In 2024, the firms that possess B100 chips may have a competitive advantage over rivals with the H-series line of chips.\nMany big-name analysts on Wall Street make a compelling case for why it makes sense to view the seemingly expensive growth stock as a potential value play. As the great Warren Buffett once put it, \u201cgrowth and value investing are joined at the hip.\u201d\nGrowth and value investing are similar in that investors strive to get more (intrinsic value) for less. At this juncture, Nvidia stock may very well be a play that momentum and value investors can appreciate.\nOn TipRanks, NVDA stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 36 analyst ratings, there are 32 Buys and four Hold recommendations. The average NVDA stock price target\u00a0is $661.64, implying upside potential of 21.2%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $560 per share to a high of $1,100 per share.\nA lead in the chip scene, I believe, ought to be worth a far larger premium to the industry, given how difficult it is for laggards to catch up to leaders in the world of chips.\nIndeed, by the time a competitor launches its latest and greatest offering that\u2019s comparable to a past Nvidia chip, Nvidia has likely already moved on to its next product (for 2024, that\u2019d be the B100 chip), one that\u2019s likely more powerful, faster, and perhaps even more power efficient.\nDisclosure\n"

The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.29%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.25%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.43%.\nShares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence witnessed a gain of 22.17% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 3.67% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.08%.\nThe upcoming earnings release of Nvidia will be of great interest to investors. The company is expected to report EPS of $4.49, up 410.23% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $20.1 billion, indicating a 232.16% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $12.31 per share and a revenue of $58.92 billion, indicating changes of +268.56% and +118.42%, respectively, from the former year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) is known for powering AI capabilities for companies around the world via its high-powered graphics processors. But at CES 2024, the company is highlighting how it\u2019s using those same capabilities to power its automotive ambitions.\nPart of that includes Nvidia building out self-driving and advanced driver safety, as well as using generative AI to better understand vehicles or interpret what\u2019s happening around a car.\n\u201cThere's a massive amount of data that's being generated from all the cameras on the car, the radar, lidar [light detection and ranging] on this vehicle, and that has to be processed in real time,\u201d Nvidia VP of automotive Danny Shapiro told Yahoo Finance, while seated in the front of Mercedes\u2019s CLA concept car at CES 2024.\n\u201cThat's when Nvidia comes in, providing the horsepower to take all that data, make sense of it, and understand exactly where the lanes are, where the potential hazards are, be able to read signs, check the lights, and so we're bringing that out now to make these vehicles safer to be an assistance feature for them,\u201d Shapiro added.\nAnd with software-updateable vehicles, Nvidia says automakers will be able to add additional assistance features over time, with the hope that future vehicles will eventually get to full autonomy.\nBut it\u2019ll still take some time before we\u2019re able to lie back in the driver seat, watching a movie or taking a nap while our cars ferry us to and fro. According to Shapiro, the industry initially underestimated the complexity of what it would take to get self-driving cars on the road.\nThat\u2019s another place Nvidia says its technology comes into play. By building out digital twins, one-for-one digital recreations of vehicles and cities in its Omniverse platform, Nvidia says it can teach self-driving AI how to handle various weather and driving situations.\nThe thinking is that by training an AI in a digital world and throwing anything they can imagine at it, Nvidia will be able to speed up the development of self-driving vehicles without having to risk potential accidents in the real world.\nGenerative AI, the standout technology of 2023, is also a part of Nvidia\u2019s auto efforts. According to Shapiro, gen AI will help provide drivers with a complete rundown of a vehicle and why it\u2019s taking certain actions.\n\u201cMercedes can train this large language model with the history of Mercedes vehicles, with all the information about the CLA concept, the manual, the service bank, whatever it is, so that when you have a dialogue with that vehicle, it comes back with the right answer,\u201d he said.\n\u201cImagine we have an automated vehicle, the front-facing cameras taking in 30 frames a second of video. We can then use a large language model to convert the pixels in that video into an explanation of what's happening in the scene,\u201d explained Shapiro.\nNvidia\u2019s automotive business is still a relatively small part of the company\u2019s total revenue. During Nvidia\u2019s fiscal third quarter, the segment brought in $261 million. That\u2019s compared to the $2.86 billion the company\u2019s gaming division generated and the $14.51 billion its data center business brought in.\nThe company currently offers a variety of car tech including infotainment capabilities, but the eventual hope is that the business expands further as the self-driving technologies mature over time. For now, though, Nvidia\u2019s advanced driver assistance functionality continues to improve.\nNow if I can just figure out a way to get that kind of stuff into my old Mustang.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "Nvidia is working on its approach to China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, as it tries to comply with Biden\u2019s chip export controls",
        "Author": "  Lionel Lim ",
        "Text": "Nvidia has a China problem. Chinese companies are some of Nvidia's biggest clients, with the country traditionally contributing about 20% of the company's revenue. Yet the Biden administration is worried that the company's chips, key to the AI revolution, are a national security risk if sent to China. That's giving the world's most valuable chip company a dilemma: How to stay involved in the world's second largest economy while still complying with Washington's rules.\nOn Monday, Nvidia announced that four car manufacturers\u2014Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, ZEEKR and Xiaomi\u2014will use the company's DRIVE technology to power their automated driving systems.\nWhile known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are now key to AI-related applications, Nvidia is also trying to get a foothold in the auto industry. The company has announced car-focused partnerships with both chip designer MediaTek and electronics manufacturer Foxconn. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang even joined Foxconn's \"Tech Day\" to announce the chipmaker would be a key partner in the Apple supplier's efforts to start making electric cars.\nNvidia is also planning to start mass production of a new set of semiconductors designed for the China market which comply with updated U.S. export restrictions, reports Reuters. The company reportedly plans to start production later this year.\nNvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nThis isn't the first time Nvidia has had to change its products to comply with U.S. rules. After the U.S. announced its first controls on semiconductor sales to China in October 2022, Nvidia developed chips for the Chinese market that offered similar capabilities to its high-end chips while still complying with U.S. rules.\nLast October, the Biden administration updated its export restrictions to close this loophole, forcing Nvidia to redevelop its products again. The updated rules even prevented Nvidia from selling its most advanced video gaming chips to Chinese firms. The chipmaker released a U.S.-compliant replacement in December, which it said was developed after the company \"extensively engaged with the U.S. government.\"\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has, at times, warned against U.S. rules against chip sales to China. He previously warned, in an interview with the Financial Times in May, that U.S. export controls aimed at slowing China's advance in the semiconductor industry would instead encourage the country to build its own chips in a bid to rival Nvidia's. Then in another interview with CNBC in November, Huang said U.S. chipmakers were at least a decade away from \"supply chain independence\" from China.\nNvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress has downplayed the near-term effect of U.S. export restrictions, yet warned that, in the long-term, U.S. restrictions would lead to a \u201cpermanent loss of opportunities for the U.S. industry to compete and lead in one of the world\u2019s largest markets.\"\nLast quarter, the company warned that data center revenue from countries affected by U.S. controls, including China, will \"decline significantly.\"\nYet Nvidia has a new problem: Chinese companies which originally flocked to its high-powered chips aren't as interested in weaker replacements.\nLocal Chinese chipmakers are pitching their own chips as a safer alternative, banking on fears among China's tech companies that the U.S. will once again tighten restrictions, according to Reuters in December.\nCompanies are also concerned that Nvidia's downgraded processors may mean there's not as much difference in performance compared to those produced by Chinese manufacturers, the Wall Street Journal reports. Firms like Alibaba and Tencent are now shifting some orders to Chinese companies like Huawei; the Chinese tech company has a new AI chip that Reuters describes as comparable to Nvidia's offerings.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Intel did not disclose a purchase price for the closely held company, controlled by venture funds Cipio Partners and Capital-E.\nChinese automaker Zeekr will be the first automaker to use Intel's AI system on a chip to create \"an enhanced living room experience\" in vehicles, including AI voice assistants and video conferencing, Intel's automotive business chief Jack Weast said ahead of the CES technology show in Las Vegas.\nIntel's new automotive system on a chip products will adapt the company's recently launched AI PC technology for the durability and performance requirements of vehicles, Weast said.\nIntel has supplied chips for infotainment systems installed in 50 million vehicles, but has been eclipsed by Nvidia and Qualcomm in the growing market for powerful semiconductors required by automated driving technology, upgradeable vehicle system software and complex dashboard displays.\n\"Intel has done a pretty terrible job communicating our success in automotive,\" Weast told reporters in a conference call ahead of the announcement at the CES technology show in Las Vegas. \"We are going to change that.\"\nIntel will try to separate itself from rivals by offering chips that automakers can use across their product lines, from lowest-priced to premium vehicles, Weast said.\n\"If AI in the car means 500 watts ... and God knows what costs ... it's not scalable,\" Weast said, referring to Nvidia's powerful, expensive products.\nNvidia last year formed an alliance with MediaTek of Taiwan to offer lower-cost chip sets. MediaTek is a leader in supplying technology for Android-based infotainment displays used in lower-priced vehicles.\nChina's fast-growing electric vehicle market will be a battleground for chip makers. Chinese vehicle makers are racing to offer advanced infotainment systems and automated driving. Zeekr, for example, is a customer for both Intel and Nvidia's technology.\nIntel will also be \"agnostic\" as to what technology for automated driving or other functions automaker customers want to use, he said.\nIntel will not require automakers to use advanced driving chips designed by its former Mobileye unit, he said. Instead, automakers can have Intel incorporate their own chiplets to enable specific functions into the Intel system at a lower cost.\n(Reporting by Joe White; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n"

        "Text": "By Chibuike Oguh\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Shares of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped on Tuesday as investor optimism over the prospects of higher demand for artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chips prompted Wall Street analysts to hike their price targets for the semiconductor giants.\nNvidia currently has a dominant position in the market for advanced AI chips, but AMD is expected to gain ground this year as the company increases deliveries of its own chips to enterprise customers, Barclays analysts led by Tom O'Malley said in an investor note.\n\"With supply constraints, customers are often using the entire NVDA platform in order to get priority shipments of accelerators,\" the Barclays analysts wrote, adding that 2024 is \"the year AI begins to open up,\" as other chipmakers like AMD gain market share.\nNvidia's stock rose 3% to $563.65 and hit a new record high, while shares of AMD surged 7.5% to $157.57, rising to their highest level in more than two years. The value of Nvidia's shares more than tripled last year, making it the world's most valuable chipmaker, while those of AMD more than doubled.\nBarclays raised its price target for AMD shares to $200 from $120, while KeyBanc analysts raised theirs to $195 from $170. Nvidia also got a price target hike to $740 from $650 from KeyBanc. Both stocks are currently among the biggest gainers of the industry-wide PHLX semiconductor index, which is up 1.15% on the session.\nThe median price target of the 53 analysts covering Nvidia's stock is $625, down slightly from $627.50 a month ago, and their current collective recommendation is \"buy\". On the other hand, the 47 analysts covering AMD's shares have a median price target of $145, up from $130 a month ago, and they also collectively recommend buying the stock, according to LSEG Data.\nNvidia plans to begin mass production later this year of an AI chip designed for its Chinese customers in order to comply with tightened U.S. export rules, Reuters reported earlier this month. In December, AMD announced two new AI data center chips, as it seeks to challenge Nvidia's flagship microprocessors.\n(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York; Editing by Nick Macfie and Mark Potter)\n"

The recognition of sovereign AI capabilities is global.\u201d\nAt the time of the interview, Huang was in Canada, which itself is home to a number of academic institutions that have significantly contributed to breakthroughs in the type of generative AI systems that power tools such as OpenAI\u2019s popular ChatGPT. The country now finds itself with a growing need for the supercomputers necessary to capitalize on the work of its academics, he said.\nHuang, who co-founded the chip designer Nvidia, has been talking for months about the need for countries and their companies to keep precious data and the intelligence that can be extracted from it local. Such a national approach to the AI boom stands to drive an expansion of data centers that would need Nvidia\u2019s know-how and hardware.\nThe world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker is estimated to have doubled its sales in the fiscal year, driven by the AI spending of its biggest customers such as Microsoft Corp. Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. Huang now wants to expand his customer base by persuading corporations and government agencies to build their own infrastructure.\n\u201cThe vast majority of the computing market has been in the US, and to a much smaller degree, China,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the very first time, because of generative AI computer technology, it\u2019s going to impact literally every single country. So some of the markets will be quite large and global.\u201d\nNvidia, which has become Wall Street\u2019s favorite bet on AI, has managed to exceed analysts\u2019 expectations for the past few quarters of earnings, and it may need to find new markets to maintain that streak. Other tech companies that have been associated with the AI boom over the past year, such as chip-making rival Advanced Micro Device Inc., have posted earnings and outlooks this quarter that disappointed investors.\nNvidia may prove the exception. It\u2019s arguably the only tech company that has demonstrated significant revenue growth from AI that has already transformed the chip supplier from a niche player to the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom. Analysts are projecting that the surge in demand for Nvidia\u2019s products will turn it into the biggest company by revenue in the chip industry as early as 2025.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Story Elon Musk Doesn\u2019t Want to Talk About\nThe Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 January 29, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN.\nTech stocks have maintained their market leadership in the New Year, building on last year's standout performance. Driving this momentum has been a combination of favorable developments on the macro front, primarily growing confidence that the Fed is on track to start easing policy, having subdued inflation without endangering the economy.\nMore specific to the Tech sector is optimism about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) that some view warily as reminiscent of the late 1990s and an emerging sense we are getting close to putting the worst of Tech spending headwinds behind us.\nWith many Tech companies on deck to report December-quarter results this week, the market will be looking for more color on business spending trends, particularly on the cloud side.\nA big part of Tech's improved earnings outlook in 2023 was a function of more effective cost controls that helped stabilize margins. Improved clarity on top-line trends will help solidify the favorable revisions trend and undergird the group's impressive stock market momentum.\nOn top of it all is the AI debate, where we have already seen direct revenue impact from the likes of Nvidia and some ideas from Microsoft. Still, the innovation's productivity-enhancing potential appears to be some ways off in the future.\nThe stock market is essentially a discounting system of the future. To the extent that we see viable business models in the days ahead that make use of AI and the so-called large language models, beyond Nvidia selling more capable chips and Microsoft starting to charge for new AI-driven bells and whistles in its Office productivity suite, the stock market excitement would be totally justified.\nThese topics will be front and center in this week's earnings reports from five of the 'Big 7 Tech players' - Alphabet and Microsoft after the market's close on Tuesday (1/30), Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple after the close on Thursday (02/01). Of the remaining two members of this 'club,' Tesla has reported already, and Nvidia's results will be coming out at the end of February.\nApple shares may not have had as impressive a showing as the other distinguished members of this club, but it has nevertheless been a standout performer. The bigger question in the Apple story appears to be the China outlook, though headlines about the watch line may have also weighed on sentiment.\nDigital advertising has historically been seen as core to Alphabet and Meta, but Amazon has steadily become a major player in the space as well. Ad spending has stabilized in the last couple of quarters, and it will be interesting to see how these management teams see trends for the current and coming periods, given the macroeconomic uncertainties. This will also be at play in the Snap report, which reports Q4 results the following week (February 6th).\nAll of these companies are big players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, with the Microsoft vs. Alphabet rivalry particularly intense. With the initial excitement around ChatGPT and other AI applications now behind us, the questions now center around how these AI capabilities will be monetized through new and existing business models. It is reasonable to expect each of these management teams to spend considerable time on their Q4 earnings calls on their AI plan.\nThe group is expected to bring in +38.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues. Please note that these expectations have steadily increased in recent months.\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled-forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. As you can see above, the expectation is for the group to be firmly back in the 'regular/normal' growth model, but much of that is contingent on how the macroeconomic picture unfolds.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.3% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues.\nAs was the case with the 'Big 7 Tech Players,' the Tech sector as a whole has been dealing with the pulled-forward revenues and earnings during Covid over the last many quarters. In fact, earnings growth for the Zacks Tech sector turned positive only in 2023 Q2 after remaining in negative territory during the four quarters prior to that.\nThis big-picture view of the 'Big 7 players' and the overall sector shows that the worst of the growth challenge has moved into the rearview mirror.\nThe 2023 Q4 earnings are expected to be up +1.1% on +2.4% higher revenues. This follows the +3.8% earnings growth reading we saw in the preceding period (2023 Q3) and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings prior to that.\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, January 26th, we now have Q4 results from 124 S&P 500 members, or 24.8% of the index's total membership.\nWe have over 300 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned mega-tech players, this week's line-up includes a who's who of the index, including Boeing, Pfizer, International Paper, Starbucks, Exxon, Chevron, and many others.\nTotal Q4 earnings for the 124 index members that have reported already are down -0.4% from the same period last year on +3.4% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 69.4% beating revenue estimates.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Breaking Down the Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard \nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "Author": " Seana Smith    \u00b7 Host",
        "Text": "A likely Biden-Trump rematch is top of mind for investors as former president Donald Trump moves closer to clinching the GOP nomination.\nFor investors, history suggests a strong pre-election year will carry over into the following year. Analysis from Carson Group\u2019s Ryan Detrick found the S&P 500 has recorded gains every election year after a 20%-plus gain in the pre-election year.\nAnd while history shows stocks usually go up regardless of which party is in the White House, analysis from Goldman Sachs found that Tech is usually the worst-performing sector in the year leading up to the general election, while Utilities and Consumer Staples tend to outperform.\nIn the near term, President Biden\u2019s green energy push, crackdown on fossil fuels, and escalating tech war with China are among the top issues for investors. For Trump, the former president\u2019s trade agenda, along with his pledge to \"drill baby, drill,\" have different implications for stock portfolios.\nEnergy policy will likely be a priority for both sides of the aisle in November.\nThough critics of Biden\u2019s renewable energy push argue he's waged a war on fossil fuels, the sector has performed quite well under the current administration. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) have reported record profits, and US oil production has hit record levels.\nBut Trump\u2019s campaign promise to deregulate energy production and abolish current renewable energy subsidies will be another boon to the oil industry, according to Keith Bliss, global head of markets and strategy for BloxCross.\n\"Big oil will be able to export as much as possible to new markets,\" Bliss told Yahoo Finance. \"When you sum up the reduction in cost, the access to new markets, the reduction in regulation costs, and the ability to produce additional products with increased feedstock, then Big Oil will make even more money.\"\nOn the other hand, Bliss warned that oil giants will \"struggle\" if President Biden is reelected, arguing the administration will likely become \"more aggressive.\"\nNo matter who wins, some industries will be facing an uphill battle.\nBoth Trump and Biden\u2019s aggressive stances toward China have the potential to \"rattle investors and corporate decision makers,\" warned China Beige Book\u2019s Shehzad Qazi.\n\"I think we're going to see a lot of aggressive maneuvers on the China front,\" Qazi told Yahoo Finance.\nTrump\u2019s decision to target China with tariffs as high as 25% during his first term put investors on edge, while Biden's initiatives to crack down on China\u2019s technological advancements placed chip giants in the crosshairs.\nPortfolio Wealth Advisors president Lee Munson warned that while neither candidate is good news for chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA), Trump could pose a bigger risk.\n\"Biden has not been friendly to China, but Trump's going to be even worse,\" Munson told Yahoo Finance Live. \"When you look at Trump, he's mercurial and could just cut off the tap... and tell Nvidia they can\u2019t sell anything.\"\nA total ban could be a massive hit to American chip giants. China accounted for about one-third of the sector\u2019s global sales in 2023, with AI leaders like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) generating at least 20% of their revenue from the country.\n\"Companies that rely on China for sales or for supply chains are going to have to adapt,\" Munson added.\nSince Biden took office, electric vehicle sales have more than quadrupled as automakers jumped on board with the administration's ambitious EV sales goals. But the transition is proving costly for traditional automakers.\nFord (F) recorded a $1.3 billion loss in its EV division in its most recent quarter; General Motors (GM) is also losing money on its EVs.\n\"They haven't figured out the EV market yet, and if Biden comes back in, the government will keep pushing the EV story,\" Bliss said. \"The Big Three could continue to struggle.\"\nHigher manufacturing costs have driven up EV price tags, making affordability an issue. Ford CEO Jim Farley told Yahoo Finance earlier this month that the company needs to lower its costs to succeed.\n\"We're seeing mainstream customers who are interested in EVs, but they're not convinced, and they're not going to pay a big premium,\" Farley said. \"So what it means for the [manufacturers] is cost \u2014 we have to dramatically reduce the cost.\"\nInvestments that take into account environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors have become a top target for Republicans ahead of the 2024 election.\nTrump has been vocal about his opposition to ESG initiatives in the past, promising to support \"a law to keep politics away from Americans\u2019 retirement accounts forever.\"\nDuring the final months of his term, he pushed to discourage employers from considering ESG issues for retirement plans, a rule later reversed by Biden.\nThe increased skepticism and scrutiny of sustainable funds from politicians and regulators has had a chilling effect on fund flows. Investors pulled a total of $13 billion from US sustainable funds in 2023, the worst year on record, according to Morningstar's data.\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company's stock led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s examine NVIDIA\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n View our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nNVIDIA appears to be overvalued by 35% at the moment, based on our discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$495 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $367.26. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that NVIDIA\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? NVDA\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on NVDA for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there\u2019s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nIn light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for NVIDIA and you'll want to know about this.\nIf you are no longer interested in NVIDIA, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Yelin  Mo and Brenda Goh ",
        "Text": "By Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh\nBEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Nvidia has started taking pre-orders for a new China-specific artificial intelligence (AI) chip from distributors who are pricing it on par with a rival product from Huawei, sources familiar with the matter said.\nThe graphics card, the H20, is the most powerful of three Nvidia has been developing for the Chinese market after the U.S. expanded bans on high-end chip exports, aiming to hamper China's ability to develop AI and sophisticated computers for its military.\nThe H20 will naturally deliver less computing power than Nvidia's flagship H100 AI chip and the H800 - the later China-specific card that was also banned in October.\nBut specifications for the H20 also appear to indicate it is less powerful than Huawei's Ascend 910B in some key areas, according to three sources, who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.\nNvidia has in recent weeks been pricing orders for H20 distributors in China in a range of $12,000 to $15,000 per card, according to two sources.\nSome distributors have started advertising the chips with a significant markup to the lower end of that range at about 110,000 yuan ($15,320), one of the sources said. By comparison, Huawei's 910B is being sold for around 120,000 yuan, two of the sources said.\nNvidia declined to comment.\nOne source said distributors are offering H20 servers, which are pre-configured with 8 of the AI chips, for 1.4 million yuan. By comparison, servers that used 8 of the H800 chips were sold at around 2 million yuan when they were launched a year ago.\nDistributors have told clients they will be able to start delivering the H20 products in small batches in the first quarter of 2024 and in larger quantities from the second quarter, the source added.\nBefore the U.S. curbs, Nvidia dominated China's AI chip market with more than 90% share. However, it currently faces increasing competition from domestic rivals, chief among them being Huawei.\nHuawei's 910B chip is widely considered the most competitive AI offering now available within China and has become more popular amid concern that buyers could be faced with further restricted access to Nvidia's products resulting from U.S. sanctions.\nIn terms of specifications, one example of where the H20 appears to lag the 910B in its FP32 performance - a critical metric that measures how quickly a chip can process common tasks and which is rated at less than half of its rival's capability, one source said.\nHowever, the H20 appears to have an advantage over the 910B in terms of interconnect speed, which measures how quickly data can transfer between chips, according to the source.\nThat means the H20 remains competitive with the 910B in applications that require linking a large number of chips together to work as a system, he said.\nReuters reported last month that Nvidia plans to begin mass production of the H20 in the second quarter of this year.\nIt was originally scheduled for launch last November but that plan was delayed, with sources saying at the time that the delay was due to issues that server manufacturers were having in integrating the chip.\nNvidia also plans to roll out two other China-specific chips, the L20 and the L2. Reuters was not able to determine the current status of the rollout for those two chips. Neither the H20, the L20 or the L2 are currently listed on Nvidia's website.\nUnderscoring the importance of the China market to Nvidia, CEO Jensen Huang visited the company's offices in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing last month for the company's annual parties before the Lunar New Year holiday, local media reported.\n($1 = 7.1780 Chinese yuan)\n(Reporting by Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n"

Indian billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani too have joined the race.\nNvidia globally has a near-monopoly on the computing systems used to power services like ChatGPT, OpenAI's blockbuster generative AI chatbot. Yotta estimates AI adoption in India to reach $14 billion by 2030.\n\"India's AI ambition is just not possible unless this infra comes to India,\" Gupta said, speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit. The event, held in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state, is one of his last major efforts to draw investments before he stands for re-election later this year.\nShankar Trivedi, a top Nvidia executive, said at the Gujarat event on Wednesday that Yotta is setting up an AI data centre in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, a new tech city, which will go live by March.\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra in Gandhinagar, Gujarat; Writing by Munsif Vengattil; Editing by Susan Fenton)\n"

Nvidia this year is easily outpacing the broader market and the rest of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks. That\u2019s making it a major bright spot as the S&P 500 Index has stalled near record highs amid questions around corporate profits and the timing of anticipated Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts.\n\u201cFrom my standpoint, Nvidia is best of breed,\u201d said Shana Sissel, chief executive officer of Banrion Capital Management LLC, adding that it\u2019s dominant in its marketplace, has strong customer relationships and is growing fast. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a lot of holes in the story.\u201d\nRead more: Nvidia Is Soaring Again as 3-Day Rally Hits 11%: Tech Watch\nNvidia had a better start on a percentage basis last year, to kick off its record rally. To be fair, those gains came after the stock lost half its value in 2022. For the next 12 months, analysts covering Nvidia have an average target price of almost $650, indicating roughly 19% upside for a company that now has a market capitalization greater than $1.3 trillion.\nThe CES trade show this month solidified confidence for proponents of Nvidia shares. The company announced three new desktop graphics chips that will allow computer users to make better use of AI on personal machines. The shares also got a boost last week when Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress reaffirmed Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang\u2019s assertion that the company expects it can continue to grow through calendar year 2025.\n\u201cNVDA expressed a tone of confidence regarding end demand and pointed to supply increases each quarter this year,\u201d Piper Sandler & Co. analysts led by Harsh V.

NVDA, The Boeing Co. BA, Sony Group Corp. SONY, The Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) and Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS).\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. , The Boeing Co. and Sony Group Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>NVIDIA\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past six months (+19.3% vs. +16.9%). The company\u2019s computer & networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of Boeing have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+4% vs. -6.8%). The company remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. During the third quarter, the jet giant booked 398 net commercial airplane orders.A strengthening U.S. defense budget should also boost Boeing\u2019s Defense, Space & Security segment growth. Boeing has ample liquidity to meet its debt obligations in the near term.However, Boeing expects supply-chain disruptions to continue to harm its operational results, at least in the near term. Its dispute with Embraer over termination of the earlier joint venture might cause it to incur some loss in the future. Rising jet fuel price also poses a threat to the stock\u2019s future growth.(You can read the full research report on Boeing here >>>)Sony\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Audio Video Production industry over the past year (+13.7% vs. +12.7%). The company\u2019s performance is benefiting from continued strength in the Games & Network (G&NS) segment. The company continues to expect to sell more than 25 million units of its PlayStation 5 in the current year.SONY sold 4.9 million units of PS5 in Q2, up 25% year over year. Strength in Music, and Pictures segments are other tailwinds. The Music segment benefits from higher recorded music and music publishing sales from paid subscription streaming services. Frequent product launches and strategic collaborations bode well.The company also raised overall guidance for fiscal 2023 revenues It now expects sales of \u00a512,400 billion compared with the earlier guidance of \u00a512,200 billion. However, SONY lowered guidance for Pictures and Financial Services segments.

        "Title": "Cathie Wood's Largest Holding Isn't Tesla or Nvidia. It's This Tech Pioneer.",
        "Author": "  Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Growth investing mastermind Cathie Wood used to hold a ton of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares. However, her Ark Invest fund family has sold most of this artificial intelligence (AI) stock over the last year, cashing in on the market's AI frenzy to seed investments in less-overheated growth stocks. These days, ARK only holds Nvidia stock worth $81 million.\nWood's funds are actively buying shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), though. With four large purchases in the last week alone, the electric vehicle and alternative energy heavyweight accounts for $763 million of Ark's stock holdings.\nBut that's not Wood's strongest position. In fact, Tesla is tied for third place among Ark's largest investments. No. 1 with a bullet is cryptocurrency marketplace Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) with a $911 million footprint on Ark's investment roster today. That's 6.8% of Ark's overall assets, far ahead of Tesla's 5.7% and Nvidia at just 0.6%.\nDespite recent sales amid Coinbase's recent price surge, this stock remains Ark's top holding by a wide margin. That's a testament to Wood's long-term vision for the cryptocurrency sector. Despite taking profits, Wood sees enduring growth opportunities in the cryptocurrency space, with Coinbase and the brand-new Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKB) at the forefront.\nMost of us ordinary investors don't manage billion-dollar funds, and what works for Cathie Wood may not be best for you and me. Still, Wood's enthusiastic stamp of approval may indicate a stock worthy of a closer look. Moreover, I'm a happy Coinbase shareholder myself. So, let's check out the reasons behind Ark's significant investment in Coinbase, examining the potential risks and rewards to help you decide if it's a fit for your own portfolio.\nCathie Wood has made it clear that she expects big things from the cryptocurrency market, and particularly the sector-leading Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) name. Her 2030 price target for the \"digital gold\" coin has been $1.48 million per token over the last year with several reiterations of the same long-term outlook. The global economy is going digital. Bitcoin's nearly inflation-free design and strictly limited supply should lead to dramatically higher coin prices over time, assuming that it remains the top crypto solution as the market evolves.\nAs such, she sees Coinbase as a leading nuts-and-bolts play on the asset-management infrastructure around Bitcoin and other cryptos. The company stands apart from other large service providers, such as Binance, thanks to its all-American background and proven focus on regulatory compliance. Unlike Binance, which has faced allegations of criminal activities and concerns over data security, Coinbase has maintained a cleaner regulatory profile.\nThis approach, in her view, positions Coinbase favorably compared to its competitors, making it a safer bet for investors looking to capitalize on the crypto market's growth. In essence, Wood sees Coinbase as a critical enabler in the broader mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. So her funds have been buying Coinbase stock when its share prices are falling due to scandals or fraud elsewhere in the crypto market.\nThat being said, Cathie Wood isn't strictly committed to the Coinbase opportunity. Her funds have reduced their Coinbase holdings by approximately half since June, 2023, taking cash profits off the table to reinvest in other ideas. Diversification works for big-name investors too, you know.\nAnd some of the former Coinbase funds have moved into more direct Bitcoin bets. Early swings at this idea included the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: GBTC) when it was a traditional fund and not a more flexible exchange-traded fund (ETF). Nowadays, Ark Invest manages its own Bitcoin-based ETF -- and some of her other funds already own shares of the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF.\nSo Wood isn't putting all her encrypted apples in the same digital cart, but spreading her cryptocurrency exposure across a couple of different asset classes. Even so, Coinbase remains Ark's largest holding, not just in the crypto sector but among the entire stock portfolio.\nMy own Coinbase investment plays a smaller part in the total portfolio. Coinbase shares account for roughly 3.6% of my stock investments today. It's my biggest crypto bet by far but only the seventh-largest position among 35 stocks and ETFs.\nSo I suppose my Bitcoin exposure is comparable to Cathie Wood's, but on a smaller scale. Is this a case of \"great minds think alike\" or two Bitcoin investors making the same mistakes independently?\nOnly time will tell -- but I'm sticking with my diversified Bitcoin investments with Coinbase in the pole position, and Cathie Wood follows a similar playbook. Whether your own Bitcoin strategy follows suit or explores completely different avenues, it's safe to say that a little bit of Bitcoin exposure makes sense in 2024.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coinbase Global right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Coinbase Global, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coinbase Global wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": "  Eleanor Pringle ",
        "Text": "Blazers and slacks outshone chipmakers in 2023 despite the furor around AI\u2014and the CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch says targeting young millennials was the golden ticket.\nOhio-based Abercrombie & Fitch exploded onto the market in the 1990s with its all-American college sports aesthetic.\nBut with a boom in online retail and with fast fashion flooding the market, Abercrombie has found itself in more recent years struggling to cut through the noise.\nOn top of that customers were also turning their backs on a company that was engulfed in race, religion, sex discrimination, and harassment lawsuits.\nSo when CEO Fran Horowitz joined in 2017 she had her work cut out to rebuild the brand from the \u201cground up\u201d\u2014but it seems to have worked.\nIn the past year, the company\u2019s share price has jumped more than 245%, buoyed by strong profit reporting and guidance.\nThat means the once infamous jeans maker is now outperforming the likes of Nvidia\u2014which although has a higher share price of $522.53 vs Abercrombie's $95.27\u2014has seen its share price rise 234% over the past year.\nEarlier this week Abercrombie further thrilled investors by raising its Q4 2023 outlook after a stronger-than-anticipated holiday trading, with net sales expected to rise into the high teens percentage range, compared with its previous estimations of lower double-digit figures.\nHorowitz said rebuilding the company at every level had been necessary to bring in such results, telling CNBC: \"[The outlook is] the result of a lot of hard work over the past few years, focussing on rebuilding our brands, investments into our technology, [and] rebuilding the company foundationally from top to bottom.\"\nHorowitz said Abercrombie learned during COVID to operate lean.\nIn its Q3 earnings reported in November, the brand said \"tightly controlled\" inventories had contributed to a gross profit rate expansion of 570 basis points.\nThe company's adjoining data revealed an inventory of $595 million, a decrease of 20% compared to the same quarter a year prior. This has led to lower write-downs of inventories.\n\"Chasing that last sale is the biggest learning that we had coming out of COVID,\" Horowitz said. \"You can do a lot more with a lot less and I think it took a year like that and a really strong lesson to understand how you can manage your business very differently. That's truly what's helping drive the terrific results that we're seeing this year.\"\nA complete overhaul was necessary for the brand to fully distance itself from allegations of the past.\nIn 2023 Abercrombie's former CEO Mike Jeffries, who left in 2014, was accused of sexually abusing young men and allegedly ran a sprawling sex ring. A spokesperson for Jeffries told CNBC the matter will be addressed in court.\nAbercrombie has been hit with a lawsuit for alleging turning a blind eye to these actions at the time.\nA spokesperson for Abercrombie & Fitch said in an emailed statement that the company was \u201cappalled and disgusted\u201d by the alleged behavior, which had been brought to light by a BBC investigation.\nIt's not often brands forget to cater to young Millennials, but specifically shifting its focus to this demographic is what brought the wins for Abercrombie & Fitch.\nWhen questioned about which brands the company was taking market share from, Horowitz insisted she was merely filling in a blank. \"[With] Abercrombie particularly there was just a big white space for us, and we aged up the consumer and went to this young Millennial consumer,\" Horowitz said.\n\"There really wasn't a lot of competition in that space and so we seized the opportunity,\" she added.\nTargeting age-specific consumers has also given Abercrombie a pipeline: pushing their teen buyers at Hollister up to Abercrombie as they age.\n\"[Hollister] was a lot of work heading into back to school this year, and we're happy to see the inflection and we've seen it across now Q3 and Q4,\" Horowitz said.\nWith questions still looming over how robust the consumer is and how long it will take inflation to come down, retailers are keeping a close eye on economic data and the likelihood of a recession.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia in 2024: 2 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech stocks skyrocketed last year as excitement over budding industries like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing rallied investors. The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index rose 67% throughout 2023, significantly improving from the year before when it plunged 40%.  And the market has shown no signs of slowing, making 2024 an excellent time to expand your position in tech.\nNvidia was one of the biggest winners last year as it snapped up a majority market share in AI chips. Its stock is up 224% year over year, making it an attractive option for investing in AI and tech in general. However, there are other stocks with similar secular tailwinds in tech that could offer more value than the chipmaker.\nSo forget Nvidia in 2024. Here are two tech stocks to buy instead.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) made headlines last week by surpassing Apple\u00a0as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap close to $2.9 trillion. The company has become a behemoth in tech, with growth catalysts across the industry.\nThe tech giant is home to some of the most widely recognized brands: Windows, Office, Xbox, LinkedIn, and Azure, which attract billions of users. These services grant Microsoft lucrative positions in markets such as operating systems, productivity software, digital advertising, cloud clouting, AI, and video games.\nThe growth of these products sent Microsoft's stock soaring 280% over the last five years, with annual revenue up 68%. Meanwhile, its free cash flow hit over $63 billion in 2023, giving it the funds to invest heavily in its research and development.\nSo, it's not surprising that Microsoft has sunk billions into AI over the last year. A heavy investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI granted Microsoft a 49% stake in the start-up. OpenAI's tech and popular services from Office and Azure could prove a powerful combination, giving Microsoft almost endless ways to monetize its AI offerings.\nThese charts show Microsoft's stock is also significantly cheaper than Nvidia's. The company has lower figures in three key valuation metrics: forward price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF), and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios.\nForward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, P/FCF divides its market cap by free cash flow. Forward P/S uses a similar calculation, dividing its market cap by estimated revenue. For all three metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value.\nThese are great ways to determine the value of a company's shares as they take into account its financial health against its stock price. In each metric, Microsoft is a far bigger bargain than Nvidia.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was slightly overshadowed last year by cloud giants like Microsoft and Amazon. However, the company has spent the last year developing a highly anticipated AI model called Gemini that could give it an edge in the market.\nAlphabet is one of the most reliable investment options in tech, with a stock that has steadily risen 113% since 2019. Meanwhile, revenue and operating income have soared 75% and 108%.\nMuch of its success is owed to its dominance in the digital advertising market. The company holds a 25% market share in the industry thanks to the massive user base it has built up through YouTube, Google, Android, and Chrome. These platforms attract billions of users, presenting countless advertising opportunities.\nThe popularity of these services will likely prove a major asset when expanding in AI. With the help of Gemini, Alphabet will be able to create a Search experience closer to ChatGPT, add new AI tools on Google Cloud, offer more efficient advertising, and better track viewing trends on YouTube.\nAlongside over $77 billion in free cash flow, it's hard to ignore the growth potential of Alphabet's business and stock.\nLike Microsoft, Alphabet's stock offers far more value than Nvidia. The tables above show Alphabet's forward P/E, P/FCF, and P/S ratios are substantially lower than the chipmaker, making its stock less of a risk.\nNvidia's meteoric rise last year has made it an expensive option. However, Alphabet remains a bargain with significant potential in tech.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks\n\u00a0\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 8, 2024\n\u00a0\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

        "Title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, NVIDIA, Meta Platforms and CrowdStrike",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 January 2, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Riot Platforms RIOT, Marathon Digital MARA, NVIDIA NVDA, Meta Platforms META and CrowdStrike CRWD.\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nThe blockchain-powered cryptocurrency made a major comeback in 2023 after a massive sell-off in 2022 on recession concerns, inflationary pressure and higher interest rates. Strong year-to-date rally in the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and Dogecoin, which have gained 155.35%, 95.45%, 149.44% and 33.83%, respectively, testifies to the current crypto boom.\nThe primary reason behind this boom is the Federal Reserve's pause on interest rate hikes. The Fed has held interest rates unchanged at 5.25% to 5.5% for the third successive meeting. It has also signaled three rate cuts in 2024.\nGrowing optimism among investors, owing to the fact that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will finally begin approving crypto spot ETF filings after stalling approval of these applications several times, remains another major positive.\nHowever, the lack of proper regulation and reliability in the cryptocurrency market remains a big concern. Increasing regulatory concerns over crypto transactions and crypto mining that witness greater governmental control are negatives.\nFurther, the market is highly volatile, which is a serious risk. Shares of notable bitcoin miners, namely Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital, tumbled in Thursday's trading, plunging 5.5% and 9.5%, respectively.\nInvestors are turning bearish about the fact that the bitcoin miners are required to make heavy investments in mining equipment, which, in turn, is making them heavily leveraged. This may lead to high volatility in the stocks.\nRecently, Riot Platforms executed a purchase option and updated its long-term purchase agreement with MicroBT, under which it placed a purchase order for 66,560 MicroBT miners for $290.5 million. Meanwhile, Marathon announced the purchase of two Bitcoin mining sites \u2014 one in Texas and one in Nebraska \u2014 for $178.6 million.\nIn addition, fears of a recession in 2024 still remain. At least, the anticipation of a soft landing for the U.S. economy in 2024, which will include a slowdown in GDP growth, remains a headwind.\nGiven this uncertain scenario, it is a prudent idea to pick those stocks for investment purposes, which are highly reputed and financially resilient. Here, we have picked NVIDIA, Meta Platforms and CrowdStrike, which not only have taken an interest in cryptocurrencies but also have strong positions in booming markets like generative AI, social media platforms and cybersecurity, among others that are comparatively stable and hold immense growth prospects.\nNotably, these stocks have returned more than 100% in 2023, thanks to their fundamental strength. Apart from this, the aforementioned stocks have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nPer Zacks' proprietary methodology, stocks with such a favorable combination offer solid investment opportunities.\nNVIDIA has gained 239.1% year to date. It is known to be the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit or GPU. It is witnessing the growing momentum of its GPUs in the cryptocurrency space. Nevertheless, the company's GPUs are also gaining solid momentum in generative AI and large language model-powered applications, which hold growth promises.\nThis apart, solid hyperscale demand and a strong uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Further, NVIDIA's collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are expected to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\nCurrently, NVDA carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. Estimates for the company's fiscal 2025 earnings have moved north by 1% to $19.91 per share over the last 30 days.\nMeta Platforms, which has already bid adieu to its cryptocurrency project Diem, is exploring ways to use blockchain-based assets in digital payments.\nMeta shares have surged 197.7% on a year-to-date basis. It is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly the Asia Pacific. Increased engagement on Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. The company is experiencing traffic growth on Instagram and Facebook, owing to its usage of AI to recommend.\nIn addition, Meta's growing efforts in the generative AI space, into which it made its foray with Large Language Model Meta AI (\"Llama\"), remain noteworthy.\nCurrently, META carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. Estimates for the company's 2024 earnings have moved north by 0.1% to $17.57 per share over the last 30 days.\nCrowdStrike's discovery of the first-ever Dero cryptojacking operation targeting Kubernetes infrastructure remains noteworthy.\nNevertheless, the company is currently benefiting from the solid demand for cyber-security solutions. CRWD has rallied 145% in the year-to-date period. An increasing number of data breaches and the growing need for security and networking products due to the ongoing hybrid working trend are leading to the uptake of CRWD's solutions. Also, the digital transformation and cloud migration initiatives being taken by various organizations are expected to continue boosting the company's end-market demand.\nCurrently, CRWD carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. Estimates for the company's fiscal 2025 earnings have moved north by 3.4% to $3.64 per share over the last 30 days.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "Text": "Good morning.\nWho was the best CEO of 2023?\u00a0Fortune used to publish an annual Businessperson of the Year list, but stopped in 2020\u2014a year in which Elon Musk took top prize.\u00a0That frees me to take my own stab this year, which I do here for your Friday enjoyment.\nI started, as we always do at Fortune, with a screener from data guru Scott DeCarlo, which looked at total returns over the last year and the last three years.\u00a0Then I added a good dollop of my own judgment, based on my understanding of the role that the CEO and the company played in driving important economic events of the year.\u00a0My top five:\n1. Jensen Huang, Nvidia2. Satya Nadella, Microsoft3. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase4. Lars Jorgensen, Novo Nordisk5. Sundar Pichai, Alphabet\nAI is obviously the big driver here, powering three of the five, and providing huge returns to investors.\u00a0Nvidia offered a stunning 239% return for the year and 280% over three years; Microsoft returned 58% and 73%; and Alphabet returned 58% and 59%.\u00a0I gave Nadella the edge over Pichai because he played the moment beautifully, partnering with OpenAI in a way his predecessors never would have, and rescuing Sam Altman from his board crisis. (I excluded Altman for failing Board Management 101.).\nDimon, of course, emerged from the banking crisis of 2023 as the world\u2019s greatest banker\u2014if he hadn\u2019t already earned that title several times before.\u00a0He is, without doubt, the GOAT.\u00a0And Jorgensen rode the other world-changing development of 2023\u2014Ozempic. By the way, Huang topped Fortune\u2019s Business Person of the Year list in 2017\u2014a year in which Dimon took the number two spot\u2014and Nadella topped the list in 2019. \u00a0Those three have staying power.\nYale\u2019s Jeff Sonnenfeld highlighted his three favorites in a piece for Fortune yesterday\u2014CVS Health\u2019s Karen Lynch, Intel\u2019s Pat Gelsinger, and Salesforce\u2019s Marc Benioff.\u00a0I am a big fan of all three.\u00a0But while Benioff offered returns on a par with my top five last year, he had a more lackluster three years.\u00a0And while Gelsinger and Lynch are both on admirable world-changing missions, they have a ways to go to show success.\nA few sentimental favorites worth mentioning:\u00a0ServiceNow CEO William McDermott has something going on that is getting plaudits from customers and employees alike, and also providing an 82% annual return to shareholders.\u00a0Adobe\u2019s Shantanu Narayen remains the sleeper in the tech crowd. And Occidental\u2019s Vicki Hollub is my favorite among the oil majors, proving you can run a great oil company and care about the climate at the same time.\nWho/what am I missing?\u00a0Send me your thoughts, and I\u2019ll share the best next week.\u00a0Other news below.\nAlan Murray@alansmurrayalan.murray@fortune.com\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were moving higher today after investors responded well to a series of announcements at CES today, which included new chips for generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, PCs and gaming, and new partnerships.\nAs a result, the stock was up 5.4% as of 2:34 p.m. ET.\nThe AI stock rose quickly this morning even before its CES presentation as investors anticipated good news.\nDuring its presentation, Nvidia unveiled a slew of new chips, including new desktop graphics chips to make it easier to use AI on a PC. The company also announced new GeForce RTX graphics cards, which offer 4K resolution and ray tracing, meaning they can create an image by tracking individual rays of light.\nNvidia said these new components were an \"order of magnitude\" better than computers powered by Intel chips. Nvidia hasn't traditionally been a major player in the large market for PC chips, but these new releases and its prowess in AI could help it gain market share in that subsector of the semiconductor industry.\nAdditionally, Nvidia announced new partnerships with companies like Amgen to use Nvidia's generative AI tools for drug discovery and data insights; Getty Images, which will use Nvidia's Picasso for a new image generation service, and with autonomous vehicle developers such as Li Auto.\nNvidia is clearly in the driver's seat in the AI race after its revenue more than tripled in its most recent quarter, and the company is unlikely to relinquish that leading position without a fight. Today's news shows that Nvidia has no intention of slowing down and will continue to innovate and launch breakthrough products.\nIf you're looking for an AI stock to own, Nvidia still seems like a no-brainer.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Sells Graphics and AI Chips, but 15% of Sales Come From Other Multi-Hundred-Billion Dollar Markets",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In 1999, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) revolutionized computer graphics with the invention of the graphics processing unit (GPU), a chip capable of rendering ultra-realistic visual effects. Nvidia GPUs have since become the gold standard in gaming and professional design. The company holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics processors.\nIn 2006, Nvidia moved beyond graphics when it introduced CUDA, a programming model that turned its GPUs into general purpose processors fit to accelerate data center applications like artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia GPUs are now the gold standard in data center accelerators, and the company holds an 80% to 95% market share in AI chips, according to analysts.\nNot surprisingly, given its dominance in graphics and AI processors, Nvidia is frequently described as a chipmaker. But that definition is somewhat misleading, because it fails to capture the scope and direction of the business. Nvidia currently derives about 15% of total revenue from adjacent multi-hundred-billion markets.\nNvidia reported revenue of $18 billion in the third quarter. That figure becomes $72 billion when annualized (multiplied by four). GPUs for gaming, professional design, and data centers accounted for most of that total, but management said software and services revenue would exceed an annual run rate of $1 billion by year end. That means Nvidia derives about 1.3% of total revenue from software and services.\nThat percentage may sound insignificant, but the figure is growing rapidly. The three products detailed below form the core of the software and services business. The first became available in late 2021, but the other two became available less than one year ago. As such, Nvidia has rapidly turned software and services into a billion-dollar business.\nAI Enterprise is a suite of software and frameworks that supports the development of AI\u00a0applications across a range of disciplines, such as recommender systems in retail, intelligent digital assistants in customer service, and route optimization in logistics.\nDGX Cloud is a cloud service that combines supercomputing infrastructure, pretrained models, and Nvidia AI Enterprise software to create an AI-as-a-service offering. Businesses can use DGX cloud to build AI applications without actually purchasing Nvidia GPUs.\nOmniverse Cloud is a cloud service that combines GPU-accelerated infrastructure with design and simulation software. It supports 3D application development and synthetic data generation, which can be used to train autonomous robots and self-driving cars.\nFor context, management says AI Enterprise, DGX Cloud, and Omniverse Cloud collectively represent a $300 billion addressable market. That means they account for almost one-third of the company's $1 trillion total addressable market.\nHere's the upshot: Nvidia is more than a chipmaker. It is a full-stack accelerated computing company, because its portfolio spans infrastructure, software, and services. That makes Nvidia a one-stop shop for graphics and AI, which cements its leadership status in both spaces.\nTo quote CFRA analyst Angelo Zino, \"We believe ... [Nvidia's] full-stack AI and software capabilities provide an incredible competitive moat.\"\nIn 2019, Nvidia extended its data center presence by acquiring networking company Mellanox. Nvidia has since melded its own innovations with Mellanox technology to great effect. Networking revenue nearly tripled over the past year, becoming a $10 billion business. That means Nvidia derives about 13.8% of revenue from networking infrastructure, a market expected to approach $200 billion in 2024.\nMoreover, Nvidia networking products are purpose-built for AI. Its InfiniBand networking platform is the gold standard in AI infrastructure for large-scale consumer internet companies and cloud providers, and it has already been adopted by Microsoft, according to CFO Colette Kress. Additionally, Nvidia recently announced Spectrum-X Ethernet networking for enterprise AI. That platform will be available early this year.\nHere's the upshot: Nvidia has improved its ability to monetize AI with InfiniBand and Spectrum. But those platforms also make its entire product portfolio more attractive by extending its full-stack strategy. Larger cloud companies and smaller enterprises can purchase all the requisite technology for developing, deploying, and running AI workloads from a single vendor. That drives cost savings by simplifying implementation and reducing complexity.\nTo quote Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, \"Nvidia's value proposition at the core is we are the lowest cost solution.\"\nNvidia was the best-performing S&P 500 stock last year, as enthusiasm surrounding generative AI drove its share price 239% higher. But the company remains well positioned to create value for patient shareholders, especially as its ability to monetize AI improves through continued success with software, services, and networking products (currently about 15% of total sales).\nGoing forward, the graphics processor market is expected to increase at roughly 28% annually through 2030, while the AI market is projected to increase at 37% annually during the same period. That gives Nvidia a good shot at annual sales growth exceeding 25% through the end of the decade.\nIn that context, its current valuation of 31 times sales is tolerable, despite being a substantial premium to the three-year average of 23.6 times sales. To be clear, Nvidia is not without risk, and shares are not cheap. But patient investors should consider buying a small position in Nvidia stock today, especially as part of a larger basket of AI stocks.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Using a deceptive tactic, she purposely disclosed this on the Friday before Christmas weekend to avoid media coverage,\u201d ongresstrading.com revealed on X, formerly Twitter.\nPelosi, aged 83, and her husband, Paul, have re-entered the Nvidia game after selling their shares and call options in the AI software company at a total loss of over $700,000 in 2022.\nTheir ill-timed departures occurred around the same time that the CHIPS and Science Act was passed into law, which Pelosi publicly supported. This law majorly benefited domestic chipmakers like Nvidia.\nSince selling their 25,000 shares, the Nvidia stock price has surged by almost 200%, according to the New York Post, which means the value of the Pelosis\u2019 original stake would have been worth in excess of $12.2 million today.\nHowever, the duo has certainly made up for it in other transactions. They have netted millions of dollars in profit from buying call options on other blue-chip stocks such as Salesforce (CRM), Roblox (RBLX), and Disney (DIS).\nThey have also made some well-timed sales. Notably, Paul Pelosi, 83, sold 30,000 shares of Google (GOOGL) stock in December 2022, just one month before the tech giant was sued over alleged antitrust violations.\nThat transaction had lawmakers crying foul about insider trading.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Not a lot of stocks outperformed Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in 2023. In fact, the artificial intelligence (AI) chip superstar was the best-performing stock on the S&P 500 index.\nNvidia shares jumped 239% last year as the company delivered blowout results thanks to skyrocketing demand for its GPUs and accelerators, which are crucial components for the infrastructure that makes AI models like ChatGPT.\nHowever, Nvidia wasn't the top performer in the entire stock market. One of the handful of companies that beat it was a little-known AI stock called Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). Here's how the two stocks did last year.\nNot only did Super Micro Computer, commonly known as Supermicro, beat Nvidia, but the stock is already up 67% in 2024, meaning it's gained nearly 500% since the end of 2022.\nWhat is this under-the-radar stock that's soaring in the AI boom? Let's take a closer look at Super Micro Computer and whether it's a smart buy today.\nIt's not a coincidence that Supermicro stock delivered results similar to Nvidia last year. The company has a lot in common with the AI chip kingpin.\nSuper Micro Computer makes high-performance and high-efficiency server and storage systems that are especially useful for AI applications.\nAs Supermicro explains it, AI workloads typically require expedited access to storage, which has driven demand for GPU-based servers. Supermicro's server systems run on Nvidia GPUs and help maximize throughput, eliminate bottlenecks, and minimize latency. The accelerated IO (input/output) of those systems can improve performance by 20% to 100% for intensive workloads.\nThat technology and its utility in running AI models is starting to drive significant growth at Supermicro.\nMuch like Nvidia did a few quarters ago, Supermicro just reported preliminary results for its fiscal second quarter that were much better than its forecast back in November. Supermicro reported revenue of $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion, compared to its earlier guidance of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. On the bottom line, it posted adjusted earnings per share of $5.40 to $5.55, which was ahead of its prior forecast of $4.40 to $4.88.\nSupermicro didn't offer much of an explanation for the soaring growth, only saying that it had strong market and end customer demand. Investors will likely learn more when Supermicro reports its complete second-quarter earnings report after hours on Monday.\nSupermicro's update was reminiscent of Nvidia's hockey-stick-like growth last year as its revenue suddenly tripled, greatly exceeding Wall Street's expectations.\nSupermicro appears to be on a similar path given the dramatic growth in the stock, but there's an important difference between the two companies. Supermicro operates with narrow gross margins. In the first quarter, they were just 16.7% and actually fell from the year before.\nTypically, a company with low gross margins does not have pricing power, or it's competing on cost. That's much different from Nvidia, which has been able to raise prices on its AI chips because there's a shortage of them and its competitors can't match its performance, at least not yet.\nBoth stocks also trade at reasonable valuations. In fact, Supermicro is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34, including its second-quarter result. Hardware is cyclical, and the fact that SuperMicro and Nvidia have relatively low P/E ratios for their growth rates shows that the market is skeptical that the current boom will last. Unlike software, hardware isn't recurring revenue, and semiconductor companies tend to see revenue fall in down cycles.\nHowever, the AI boom still appears to be just getting started as hyperscalers like Oracle are building data centers as fast as they can, and the hardware needed to run them is likely to be in high demand for the foreseeable future.\nThere's still a lot of uncertainty in the evolving AI market, which means that Supermicro stock carries risk, but with the updated guidance, its similarities to Nvidia, and unprecedented demand for AI hardware, the upside potential clearly outweighs the downside risk.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Super Micro Computer wasn't one of them.
