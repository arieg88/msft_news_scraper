        "Text": "Three decades ago, the advent of the internet changed the growth trajectory of corporate America forever. Since then, investors have been waiting for the next game-changing innovation, technology, or trend to rival what the internet did for businesses. After decades of patience, it appears as if artificial intelligence (AI) has been anointed as the next leap forward in innovation.\nThe rise of AI is all about the use of software and systems for tasks that would typically be undertaken by humans. What gives AI such broad-reaching potential is the capacity for software and systems to learn and evolve without human intervention. Becoming more proficient at assigned tasks, as well as learning new skills, gives this technology a limitless long-term ceiling.\nYet in spite of the otherworldly growth forecasts attached to AI \u2014 the analysts at PwC expect AI to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 \u2014 not everyone on Wall Street is convinced of its upside.\nBased on Form 13F filings that detail the trading activity of Wall Street's smartest asset managers, prominent billionaire investors were big-time sellers of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock during the March-ended quarter.\nAlthough artificial intelligence euphoria has largely been credited with pushing Wall Street's major stock indexes to fresh all-time highs, eight successful billionaire money managers chose to send shares of Nvidia to the chopping block during the March-ended quarter (total shares sold in parenthesis and adjusted for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June):\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (29,370,600 shares)\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (24,627,160 shares)\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (7,200,040 shares)\nStanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (4,415,510 shares)\nDavid Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (4,208,010 shares)\nDavid Tepper of Appaloosa (3,480,000 shares)\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (3,045,050 shares)\nWhile simple profit-taking following Nvidia's stellar run-up might explain some of this selling activity, history and valuation are the likelier catalysts.\nAs I pointed out earlier, it's been about 30 years since the internet began changing the growth trajectory for businesses and the U.S. economy. Since then, numerous next-big-thing innovations and trends have come and gone. While some of these technologies and trends have gone on to be wildly successful over the long run, they all endured an early stage bubble. All new technologies and trends need time to mature, and artificial intelligence isn't any different. If the AI bubble were to burst, as history suggests it will, no company would take it on the chin more than Nvidia.\nNvidia is also set to face growing competition for GPU real estate in high-compute data centers. What optimists seem to be overlooking is that even if Nvidia maintains its compute advantage, its inability to meet overwhelming demand is going to allow competitors to grab market share.\nMoreover, its four top customers (all members of the \"Magnificent Seven\") are developing AI-GPUs for their data centers. Even though these internally developed chips lack the compute advantage of Nvidia's H100 GPU, they're cheaper and are going to take up valuable data center real estate.\nThe final nail in the coffin is that Nvidia's trailing-12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is on par with the peak TTM P/S ratios seen from market leaders like Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble.\nWhat's truly interesting is that while these prominent billionaire money managers were dumping shares of Nvidia, they were busy piling into two hypergrowth stocks that have little or nothing to do with AI.\nThe first supercharged growth stock that caught the attention of the billionaire asset managers who've been selling shares of Nvidia is hydrogen fuel-cell solutions company Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG). Nvidia's three biggest billionaire sellers were all buyers of Plug Power stock during the first quarter (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (3,800,039 shares)\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (3,439,975 shares)\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (546,925 shares)\nThe lure of Plug Power as an investment is the high-ceiling potential of renewable energy as it pertains to transportation and infrastructure. Management believes the company can generate $20 billion in sales by 2030, which would be one phenomenal growth rate considering the company reported $891 million in full-year sales in 2023.\nPlug Power is in the midst of expanding its green hydrogen network. Among other things, this involves improving the efficiency of its supply chain, increasing prices across its product and service portfolio, and meaningfully improving its margins.\nBut in spite of its rapid growth prospects, Plug Power's future is highly uncertain. It's been a cash-burning machine since its inception and has regularly turned to share offerings in order to keep the lights on. Last week, Plug announced a $200 million share offering that was priced well below where its stock had closed the previous day. With operating losses expected to continue for years to come, more share offerings seem likely.\nPlug Power also has to overcome a shift in sentiment toward clean-energy vehicles. Infrastructure limitations are one reason electric vehicle (EV) demand has weakened in recent quarters. With EV demand acting as something of a proxy for hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle demand, Plug may find that the market for its products is lukewarm, at best.\nThe other hypergrowth stock that had Nvidia's billionaire sellers mashing the buy button is Singapore-based Sea Limited (NYSE: SE). Even though Sea has little to do with artificial intelligence, five of Nvidia's billionaire sellers were decisive buyers in the March-ended quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,527,446 shares)\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (678,308 shares)\nDavid Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (338,720 shares)\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (190,432 shares)\nWhat makes Sea such an appealing investment is the company's trio of fast-growing operating segments.\nThe division consistently responsible for generating positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) is Sea's digital entertainment segment, known as \"Garena.\" The biggest catalyst for Garena is Free Fire, which is one of the world's most-popular mobile games. During the first quarter, Garena had nearly 595 million quarterly active users, 8.2% of which were paying to play its games. This pay-to-play ratio is considerably higher than the industry average for mobile gaming.\nSea's second rapidly growing segment is SeaMoney, its digital financial services operations. Many of the countries Sea operates in are chronically underbanked, with businesses and consumers lacking access to basic financial services. SeaMoney offers solutions (loans) to this common problem in Southeast Asia.\nBut the most-promising of all operating segments is e-commerce platform Shopee, which operates in Southeastern Asia and Brazil. The $23.6 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) traversing its platform during the first quarter equates to $94.4 billion on an annualized run-rate basis. For some context on just how quickly Shopee is growing, GMV in the entirety of 2018 was $10 billion.\nIf these three operating segments continue to fire on all cylinders, Sea Limited can sustain annual sales growth of 15% (or greater), and deliver triple-digit annualized earnings growth through 2028, based on Wall Street's consensus forecast.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "For three decades, investors have been patiently waiting for the next great innovation to come along that would rival what the internet did for corporate America. The arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) might be just what the doctor ordered.\nArtificial intelligence allows software and systems to oversee tasks that humans would normally undertake. The key to AI's seemingly limitless potential is that software and systems have the capacity to learn without human intervention. This gives the technology utility in pretty much every facet of the U.S. and global economy.\nThough growth estimates are all over the map, the most eye-popping forecast comes from the analysts at PwC, who believe AI can add an estimated $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade. With dollar figures this immense, it's not a surprise that Wall Street's smartest and richest money managers have been piling into AI stocks.\nBut what might come as a shock is that leading AI company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which has gained nearly $3 trillion in market value since the start of 2023, has been a top sell candidate for more than a half-dozen billionaire money managers.\nThanks to quarterly filed Form 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission, everyday investors have the ability to track what Wall Street's top money managers are buying and selling. The March-ended quarter saw eight billionaires \u2014 nine if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies \u2014 dump shares of Nvidia stock. However, the three most-prominent billionaire sellers were (total shares sold in parenthesis have been adjusted for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June):\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (29,370,600 shares)\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (24,627,160 shares)\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (7,200,040 shares)\nWhile profit-taking is a viable reason that could explain why prominent billionaire asset managers sent Nvidia to the chopping block during the first quarter, there are a few other headwinds that may have encouraged this exodus.\nTo begin with, Nvidia will almost certainly face increasing competition in the coming quarters. Advanced Micro Devices is ramping up production of its MI300X graphics processing unit (GPU) for high-compute data centers, and Intel is launching its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerating chip during the current quarter.\nMoreover, Nvidia's four largest customers, which account for approximately 40% of its net sales, are developing in-house AI-GPUs of their own. The problem for Nvidia is that, even if maintains its compute advantages and develops next-generation AI-GPU architecture that outpaces its rivals, the mere presence of other chips reduces data center space for Nvidia's hardware. It also limits the AI-GPU scarcity that's driven its pricing power into the heavens.\nPerhaps the most damning factor of all might just be that no buzzworthy innovation, technology, or trend over the last 30 years has escaped an early stage bubble. History shows that investors always overestimate the uptake and utility of new technologies, which makes it likely that AI will follow suit. If the AI bubble were to burst, Nvidia's stock would likely be hit hard.\nBut while these top billionaire investors were busy sending shares of Nvidia to the chopping block, they were piling into three surprising value stocks.\nNvidia's biggest billionaire seller undeniably had eyes for the leading financial technology (fintech) stock during the first quarter. Coatue Management's 13F notes that the fund picked up more than 8 million shares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), which as of March 31 were worth almost $539 million.\nAlthough competition is increasing among digital payment and peer-to-peer payment providers, most of PayPal's important user metrics signal continued growth. Payment transactions grew by 11% in the March quarter to 6.5 billion, while total payment volume has sustained a double-digit growth rate, sans currency movement.\nFurthermore, the company's active accounts are more engaged than ever. Though active account growth has stalled in recent quarters, the average payments completed by active accounts over the trailing-12-month period has increased from 40.9 at the end of 2020 to 60 on the nose, as of the end of March 2024. Since this is primarily a usage-driven platform, higher engagement is a recipe for an increase in gross profit.\nWith Wall Street's consensus calling for nearly 16% annualized earnings growth through 2028, a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 13 makes PayPal stock quite the deal.\nThe world's most-profitable hedge fund since inception, which is overseen by billionaire Ken Griffin, opted to trade out shares of Nvidia for time-tested financial institution Bank of America (NYSE: BAC).\nAmong America's largest banks by assets, Bank of America is the most sensitive to changes in interest rates. The Federal Reserve's most-aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s might not have been well received by borrowers, but it's been a godsend for lenders like BofA. The longer the nation's central bank stands pat on interest rates, the more net-interest income BofA and its peers can collect.\nBank of America also deserves plenty of credit for its technological prowess. While it might not be the first company you think of when it comes fintech innovation, BofA's digitization efforts are paying off. A whopping 76% of consumer households were banking online or via mobile app in the first quarter, and exactly half of all loan sales were completed digitally. Digital transactions are considerably cheaper than in-person interactions and will, over time, improve Bank of America's operating efficiency.\nA forward P/E ratio of a little over 11 suggests that Bank of America stock is still a bargain for investors.\nAlthough billionaire Israel Englander is known for his love of fast-paced tech stocks, it's pharmaceutical company Merck (NYSE: MRK) that proved to be the apple of his and his investment team's eye during the March-ended quarter.\nIf there's a primary lure to owning Merck stock, it's Keytruda, the company's world-leading cancer immunotherapy. Improved cancer-screening diagnostics, phenomenal pricing power, increased use in existing indications, and label expansion opportunities have put Keytruda on pace for nearly $28 billion in annual run-rate revenue. With constant-currency sales growth of 24% in the March quarter, there's no reason to believe Keytruda's growth will slow anytime soon.\nAn unsung hero for Merck that doesn't get anywhere near enough attention is its Animal Health segment, which accounts for almost 10% of the company's net sales. Between keeping livestock healthy and the willingness of pet owners to spend a small fortune on the well-being of their furry, feathered, gilled, and scaled family members, Merck's pet division provides a steady growth foundation.\nWith sustained double-digit earnings per share (EPS) growth expected, Merck's forward P/E of 13 continues to look like a value.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The Nvidia (NVDA) money-making train has only just pulled out of the station.\nOr so says one veteran tech investor.\n\"I'm saying like it [Nvidia's value] could double again between now and the end of the year,\" EMJ Capital founder and president Eric Jackson said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above or listen here).\nTo put that in perspective, Jackson thinks Nvidia's market cap could hit $6 trillion by year-end from $3.25 trillion or so currently.\nJackson reasoned the company stands to get there by delivering a very, very strong earnings report in August or November (or both) that shows off continuing demand for H100 and H200 chips while teeing up the potential of its new AI-focused Blackwell chips.\nThat would align with what Nvidia founder Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance on demand trends back in late May.\nIf Nvidia's earnings reports come in as he expects, Jackson thinks investors will be open to paying a much higher price-to-earnings (PE) multiple to own its stock.\nThat's a bold statement, seeing as Nvidia already trades on a forward PE of about 50 times, per Yahoo Finance data, almost two times the broader market multiple.\nAdded Jackson, \"I don't know if it's going to be August [earnings], I don't know if it's going to be November [earnings], but I think there is going be this euphoric reaction. And if so, the stock goes back to 65x forward earnings and you're there at like $250 per share.\"\nNvidia shares trade at $131 as of this writing, up more than 170% year to date.\nTo be sure, it has been another year of milestones for Nvidia.\nOn June 18, its market cap hit a staggering $3.34 trillion, eclipsing Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world's most valuable company. Before that, Huang took the wraps off his powerful Blackwell chips and proclaimed the company is building AI factories.\nNvidia has since lost the most-valuable-company crown to Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (second place), but detractors on the Street are few and far between.\n\"Positive takeaways for Nvidia include: 1) despite the impending launch of Blackwell in the second half of 2024, we are not seeing any signs of a demand pause as demand for H100 remains robust, as we continue to see rush orders; and 2) the interest and demand in GB200 is greater than we initially had sized as the majority of the mix is expected to be NVL72 vs. NVL36,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh said in a client note this week.\nA few non-Nvidia permabulls have started to appear, however.\nNew Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu downgraded his rating on Nvidia last week to Neutral, citing valuation concerns.\nFerragu said he sees \"limited further upside\" based on conversations with contacts in the supply chain. The bull case on Nvidia may not emerge beyond 2025, putting expectations at risk, Ferragu explained.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia's success story is attracting hungry competitors \u2014 and that may stand in the way of the chip juggernaut, warned Goldman Sachs asset manager Brook Dane.\n\"There's very little likelihood that there isn't competition out there [for Nvidia],\" he said.\nFind more episodes of Opening Bid on our video hub.

        "Author": "  Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's one stock that everyone wants to talk about: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). And for good reason. The stock has gained nearly 1,000% in less than two years, meaning a $10,000 investment in late 2022 would be worth almost $100,000 today.\nWhile nobody can predict what will happen, there are two paths forward for Nvidia. One path is promising; the other is downright terrifying.\u00a0Let's dive in and see which is more likely.\nThe bull case for Nvidia goes something like this: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the story of the next 20 years. It will bring changes to the way people interact on a level equal to or exceeding those brought on by the smartphone in the mid-2000s. Therefore, the best historical comparison for Nvidia is Apple in 2004.\nBack then, Apple's hot new product was -- wait for it -- the iPod. Remember that? The company wouldn't debut its first iPhone for another three years. \nNevertheless, Apple was already well on its way to becoming the world's largest company. In 2004, its stock grew by more than 200%, making it the top performer in the S&P 500.\nFrom 2004 until today, its market cap has surged at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36%. A $10,000 investment made 20 years ago would be worth $4.8 million today.\nIt would be incredibly difficult for Nvidia to repeat that performance, but it is possible. AI is a fascinating new technology, and 20 years is a very long time, giving the company plenty of runway to live up to the lofty expectations surrounding its stock.\nBut what about the bear case?\nThis is the bear case for Nvidia: AI is a promising technology but overhyped. Due to elevated valuations in AI stocks, a stock market bubble has formed, and when it pops, Nvidia's stock will feel the pain. In short, Nvidia today is like Oracle in 2000.\nTo recap, the 1990s were full of hope for the internet. In particular, the stock market went gaga for internet stocks. Valuations soared, not just for brand-new companies but also for legacy tech companies that were cashing in on the internet craze. \nIn particular, Oracle, whose business revolved around facilitating the transition from mid-century mainframe computers to modern servers for enterprise clients, saw its stock skyrocket in the late 1990s.\nUnfortunately for Oracle, expectations ran far ahead of actual sales. At its peak in 2000, its stock traded with a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 24, far above its lifetime average of 5. \nWhen the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, Oracle experienced an 85% drawdown. The stock has taken over 20 years to recover its pre-bubble high. Those who bought in the summer of 2000 and held through 2020 would have made almost no money on their investment.\nORCL data by YCharts.\nIt's a lesson that even companies with the most promising technological innovations and solid business models don't necessarily make great investments.\nOn the one hand, Nvidia's P/S ratio has a scary resemblance to Oracle's in the run-up to its crash in 2001.\nThat should give pause to any Nvidia bull. Simply put, the stock is so expensive now that some moderation must occur. \nEither the company's sales will continue to grow like a weed to bring down the ratio, or the stock price will have to come down. Factors such as increased competition, market saturation, or a slowdown in AI and semiconductor spending could decrease Nvidia's P/S ratio.\nMy gut tells me it's the latter, although the party could continue for some time. Either way, I recommend caution with Nvidia stock. \nUnlike many of its mega-cap peers, the company lacks a well-diversified business model. Its stock is performing well because AI and semiconductor spending has gone through the roof, but that trend may taper off -- particularly if the economy deteriorates or enters a recession.\n Moreover, if the demand for AI and semiconductor technology were to decline, Nvidia's stock could be in for a rough ride -- perhaps as bad as Oracle's 23 years ago.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Nvidia, along with tech giants Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, are worth $14.5 trillion and make up about 32% of the S&P 500. With the AI darling\u2019s data center revenue growing at about 60%, Anderson calculated, should the pattern continue over the next decade, the company would have a market capitalization of about $49 trillion. That\u2019s more than the entire value of every company in the S&P 500, which is roughly $45.84 trillion. Anderson estimated a 10% to 15% probability of this outcome.\nAnderson\u2019s projection is a lofty one, but his hunches have proved correct before. With a go-big-or-go-home mentality, he was one of Amazon\u2019s and Tesla\u2019s biggest champions (for the EV giant, Anderson\u2019s investments were second only to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s). From 2005 to 2021, Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, managed by Baillie Gifford, saw returns of 2,240%. It invested in Nvidia in 2016. Lingotto Investment Management, where Anderson is now an investor, has a $650 million fund with Nvidia as its largest position.\nNvidia didn\u2019t have a clear path to success when Anderson first began investing in the company, he said. It remained to be seen if it would be a gaming, crypto, or AI company. But it did have the advantage of early success, unlike Amazon and Tesla, which \u201cdidn\u2019t start from highly profitable and dominant positions but had to get there.\u201d In some ways, Anderson still sees Nvidia as a nimble company.\n\u201cIt is the long duration of the development of [graphic processing units] usage in AI\u2014and not just AI\u2014from excitement, through potential pauses, to transformation of industries that is most important to us,\u201d Anderson said.\nOther finance experts don\u2019t share Anderson\u2019s bullish take on Nvidia. Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, argues Nvidia is riding a wave of early AI optimism.\n\u201cThe momentum is clearly with Nvidia,\u201d Damodaran told CNBC in May. \u201cThey can do nothing wrong. Everything they touch turns to gold.\u201d\nDamodaran said Tesla experienced a similar rally in 2020, when its market cap soared, peaking in 2021 at $1.2 trillion, only for shares to plummet about 30% this year alone. Meta and Google also grappled with increased competition that have loosened their grip on the tech world. While Nvidia has the earnings to back up its sky-high value, the expectations for the future of the company may be too steep, he argued. Damodaran said the AI chip market is not worth $1 trillion alone, and the AI market more broadly is worth about $2 trillion or $3 trillion, meaning Nvidia would have to tap into several big AI markets to maintain and grow its value.\n\u201cIt's clearly a possibility,\u201d Damodaran said. \u201cBut is it plausible? I don't think so.\u201d\nIt\u2019s too early to say if Nvidia has the juice to lead Big Tech into the AI frontier in the long term, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Doug Clinton said. Nvidia\u2019s colossal growth may appear scary, but it\u2019s sustainable, particularly as the demand for AI is expected to increase.\n\u201cDespite all of us worrying that eventually this demand for chips will slow down, we haven't really seen that slowdown happen yet,\u201d Clinton told Yahoo Finance last month. \u201cAnd it may take longer to slow down than we think.\u201d\nWith Nvidia making up over 80% of the global GPU semiconductor market, the company will likely continue to ride high in the foreseeable future, Clinton said.\n\u201cCan Nvidia maintain its dominant position providing the brains to these artificial intelligence models?\u201d he said. \u201cI think they can for the next three to five years.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Outsized positions in artificial intelligence darling Nvidia (NVDA) have boosted portfolio managers' returns this year but the bets stand to magnify risk if the chipmaker's red-hot shares see a reversal of fortune.\nNvidia shares are up about 785% since the start of 2023 and have risen some 160% this year alone, boosted by demand for its chips, seen as the gold standard in the AI field. Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company in June before a dip in its shares returned that title to Microsoft.\nAsset managers\u2019 holdings of the chipmaker have swelled alongside its stock price. Morningstar data showed that 355 actively managed funds held Nvidia positions that totaled 5% or more of their assets at the end of the first quarter, compared to just 108 funds in the same period last year. Funds can maintain large positions in a single holding for a variety of reasons, whether to maximize profits or to track a stock\u2019s weight in an index to which the fund is benchmarked.\n\u201cThere's a mindset among some portfolio managers that they missed the boat on Apple or Microsoft and they don't want to be wrong on AI,\" said Jack Shannon, a senior Morningstar analyst. \"They don't want to sell.\u201d\nThe oversized positions in Nvidia are another example of how investors have cast their lots with a handful of massive growth stocks, leading to one of the most concentrated market advances ever. Nvidia alone has accounted for around a third of the S&P 500\u2019s nearly 17% gain this year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nOverall, markets are the third-narrowest since 1986, with only 24% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperforming the index in the first half, according to BofA Global Research strategists.\nFunds that owned Nvidia have so far reaped the benefits. Actively-managed U.S. equity funds that held the stock were up 16.3% on average over the first six months of 2024, compared with an average 5.7% return among those that did not own Nvidia, Morningstar data showed.\nYet concentration in a single stock can hurt investors if Nvidia shares hit a rough patch. While the average price target for the stock among analysts stands at $133.45, some 3% above its current level, according to LSEG data, some market participants point to increasing competition, an expected balance between supply and demand as Nvidia ramps up production, and the company's rich valuation as possible reasons for a downturn.\nThe stock trades at 39.3 times forward earnings, about 50% more than its industry median, according to LSEG.\n\u201cDoes having 6% or more of your portfolio in one stock create outsized risks? The answer is obviously, yes,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes. \u201cThe fact that one stock did take off like a rocket ship doesn\u2019t mean that it was smart ... to have that many eggs in one basket.\u201d\nInvestors got a taste of how concentrated positions can be a two-way street last week, following a sharp, one-day rotation out of Big Tech stocks sparked by cooler inflation data. Nvidia fell nearly 6% on Thursday, its biggest daily drop in more than two weeks, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 lost about 2.2%. Both pared those losses the following day.\n'Twinge of regret'\nTechnology-sector funds overall have the largest weightings in Nvidia, with four Fidelity funds each holding more than 18% of their assets in the stock, according to Morningstar. Yet other, more diversified, funds appear to be taking on similar risks, with the Baron Fifth Avenue Growth fund holding nearly 15% of its portfolio in Nvidia and the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth fund holding about 13% of its portfolio in the stock. Both firms declined to comment.\nAnthony Zackery, a portfolio manager at Zevenbergen Capital Investments, has owned Nvidia since 2016 and continues to maintain a core position, though he has trimmed it periodically to keep within his firm\u2019s risk-tolerance guidelines. The fund can hold as much as 13% of one stock in growth portfolios to keep in line with weightings in its benchmark, the Russell 3000 Growth Index.\n\"This is a company that is at the forefront of the next trend in technology,\" he said.\nSome who sold out entirely, on the other hand, wish they had held on longer.\nKevin Landis, chief investment officer at Firsthand Capital Management, said he was \"prudent\" and took profits in 2020 in a Nvidia position he owned for several years. Still, he can\u2019t help thinking about the gains he missed out on.\n\"I can\u2019t look at any of my screens now without feeling a twinge of regret,\" he said.\n(Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Rod Nickel)\n"

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman ",
        "Text": "At this point, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) needs no introduction. Almost everyone probably knows the artificial intelligence (AI) leader by now.\nNvidia stock has exploded over the last year and a half, and even briefly earned the title of the world's most valuable company, surpassing perennial tech titans Apple and Microsoft to top the charts.\nThe company dominates the market for data center graphics processing units (GPUs), the semiconductor components used to run powerful AI models like ChatGPT, with an estimated market share of 98% in 2023.\nHowever, virtual monopolies in fast-growing markets tend to attract competition, and that's just what's happening to Nvidia. AMD and Intel have both launched their own competing AI GPUs, and even some of the smart money seems to think Nvidia stock could be due for a breather.\nStanley Druckenmiller, who posted an average annual return of 30% in more than two decades running Duquesne Capital Management, cut nearly all of his Nvidia stake in the first quarter, believing that AI stocks may have gotten too hot. Other billionaire fund managers like Steve Cohen of Point72 and Millennium Management's Israel Englander have also dumped shares of Nvidia.\nHowever, one billionaire investor, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, sounds downright bullish on Nvidia. Comments he made about Nvidia in Tesla's recent earnings call should reassure Nvidia investors who might be worried about competition.\nTesla, which is focused on building autonomous vehicles and autonomous robots, is one of the biggest buyers of AI hardware. Musk's other companies, such as X and xAI, are also buying Nvidia's components.\nOn Tesla's recent earnings call, Musk underscored the need for Nvidia's products, saying in response to a question on Tesla's Dojo supercomputer:\nYes. So Dojo, I should preface this by saying I'm incredibly impressed by Nvidia's execution and the capability of their hardware. And what we are seeing is that the demand for Nvidia hardware is so high that it's often difficult to get the GPUs. And there just seems this \u2014 I guess I'm quite concerned about actually being able to get [unclear] Nvidia GPUs when we want them.\nIn other words, despite AMD and Intel having launched their competing products (the MI300 and Gaudi 3, respectively) months ago, there's no sign that they are having a meaningful impact on Nvidia's control of the data center GPU market. Demand for Nvidia's products still remains extraordinarily high and shortages continue. Musk also noted that the price for Nvidia's GPUs has soared due to unmet demand for the products. That doesn't mean that competitors like AMD and Intel won't eventually take market share from Tesla, but according to Musk's commentary, so far Nvidia's monopoly is intact.\nWhile Nvidia is likely to face more competition, it's a mistake to think that its products are commodities that can be easily replicated by its rivals.\nMusk's remark that he is \"incredibly impressed by Nvidia's execution and the capability of their hardware\" also shouldn't be overlooked. After all, Musk, who was also a co-founder of OpenAI, is in as good a position as anyone else to assess the AI landscape, and he's not in the habit of doling out compliments to would-be competitors just to be nice.\nFor Nvidia, Musk's comments are a reminder that the company's blistering growth is likely to go on, especially as it continues to push the envelope with its new Blackwell platform to stay ahead of the competition.\nIt's understandable that investors would fear a pullback in a stock that has run so far so fast, but Nvidia is safer than the bears think. Not only is demand for its product still outpacing supply nearly two years after ChatGPT launched, but the stock itself looks reasonably priced. It's trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 40, which is cheaper than Musk's Tesla and AMD, and only modestly more expensive than Intel, which is expected to report negative revenue this year.\nConsidering Musk's comments and its entrenched advantages in GPUs, it's still not too late to buy Nvidia stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Its shares have surged over 175% in the last 12 months, pushing its market capitalization above the $3 trillion mark.\nAnderson, who recently teamed up with the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family to launch Lingotto Investment Management, said Nvidia's \"persistent exponential progress, the competitive advantages in hardware and software, and the culture and leadership are exactly what we look for.\"\nWhen assessing the difference between Nvidia and some of his previous successful tech bets Anderson notes: \"Amazon, Tesla etc didn't start from highly profitable and dominant positions but had to get there\".\nHe explained that the real growth in data center AI chip demand looked to be running at about 60% per year. When assessing the next decade, he stated that 10 years of 60% growth in data center revenue alone, with unchanged margins, would result in earnings of $1,350 per share and free cash flow of approximately $1,000 a share.\nThe FT said Anderson remarked that an Nvidia share might be worth $20,000 in 10 years, translating to a market capitalization of $49 trillion. Anderson assigned the probability of this type of outcome at 10% to 15%.\nHe added: \"It is the long duration of the development of GPU usage in AI \u2014 and not just AI \u2014 from excitement, through potential pauses, to transformation of industries that is most important to us.\"Anderson believes the route to the extremely lofty valuation will likely be volatile, and it would not be surprising if the chipmaker had one or more significant drawdowns.\nRelated Articles\nCan Nvidia really hit $50 trillion market cap like this tech investor suggests?\nThese stocks are benefiting from what could be a larger market rotation\nProgressive shares up 2% as Q2 earnings exceed estimates\n"

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The past five years have been stunning for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shareholders as the company's market cap has soared by a phenomenal 2,900%, turning an investment of just $100 in the stock half a decade ago into just over $3,000 as of this writing.\nNvidia stock's 30x rise in these past five years can be justified by the multiple catalysts that have been driving the company's growth. The exceptionally robust demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) that are deployed in personal computers (PCs), data centers, and automotive applications has led to a terrific increase in the company's revenue and earnings during this period.\nNow, it would seem far-fetched to expect Nvidia stock to rise another 30x over the next half-decade considering that it has a market cap of just over $3 trillion right now and is one of the three largest companies in the world. The entire global economy, for comparison, was worth an estimated $105 trillion in 2023. However, considering the catalysts ahead, there is a good chance that shares of Nvidia could continue heading higher over the next five years, even if those gains may not be as astronomical as those of the past five.\nFor Nvidia's fiscal 2024, which ended Jan. 28, its revenue stood at $60.9 billion, up from $11.7 billion in its fiscal 2019. So, Nvidia's top line has increased fivefold over the last five years. Looking ahead, analysts are forecasting something similar may happen thanks to the massive growth driver that is the artificial intelligence (AI) market.\nMizuho Securities is anticipating Nvidia's data center revenue alone will jump to $280 billion in 2027, which will coincide with the majority of Nvidia's fiscal year 2028. That would be a huge increase over the $47.5 billion data center revenue the company reported in fiscal 2024 (which ended in January this year and coincided with 11 months of 2023) and the $89 billion revenue it is projected to generate from this market in the current fiscal year 2025.\nOne reason why that forecast may be accurate is that the market for AI chips is expected to reach a whopping $400 billion in annual revenue in 2027 (which would be fiscal 2028 for Nvidia), according to Nvidia's peer AMD. Mizuho's Nvidia revenue estimate for calendar 2027 (fiscal 2028 for Nvidia) suggests that it would be controlling 70% of the AI chip market at that time. Though that would be lower than the 90%-plus share that the company currently commands in this market, it would still be able to deliver a massive bump in revenue considering the potential size of the AI chip market after four fiscal years.\nWhat's worth noting here is that even if the AI chip market takes longer than forecast to hit $400 billion in revenue and even if Nvidia's share shrinks to as low as 50%, its data center revenue alone could grow still four-fold in the coming years.\nNvidia has other potential growth drivers that could contribute to the expansion of its top line.\nFor instance, the market for gaming GPUs that are installed in PCs is likely to benefit from an increase in spending on gaming hardware. Statista predicts that the gaming hardware market will generate $161 billion in revenue in 2024, and forecasts that it could grow to $241 billion by 2029. Nvidia should be a big beneficiary of this growth considering that it controlled an impressive 88% of the market for PC graphics cards in the first quarter of 2024.\nMeanwhile, in the first quarter of its fiscal 2025, growing demand for digital twin systems drove revenue in Nvidia's professional visualization business up by 45% year over year to $427 million.\nNvidia is scratching the surface of a potentially huge opportunity in the digital twin market. According to a forecast from Mordor Intelligence, that space could generate $126 billion in revenue in 2029. From this year's forecast $26 billion, that would be a compound annual growth rate of 37%. More importantly, Nvidia is building a solid base of customers for its digital twin offerings. This was evident from the remarks made by CFO Colette Kress on the latest earnings conference call:\nCompanies are using Omniverse to digitalize their workflows. Omniverse-powered digital twins enable Wistron, one of our manufacturing partners, to reduce end-to-end production cycle times by 50% and defect rates by 40%. And BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is adopting Omniverse for virtual factory planning and retail configurations.\nKress added that industrial software developers such as Cadence, Ansys, Dassault, and Siemens are some of the major names that are adopting its digital twin software. As such, there is a good chance that Nvidia's revenue growth over the next five years could match the growth that it has experienced in the past five. In fact, analysts are forecasting that its top line will triple in the space of just three fiscal years (from fiscal 2024 levels of $60.9 billion).\nAssuming Nvidia does hit $184.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2027, its top line would have increased at a compound annual rate of 45%. If the semiconductor giant's growth tapers off in the two that follow years to, let's say 25% a year, its revenue could reach $288 billion after five years. That would be close to a 5x increase in its revenue from fiscal 2024, and would be almost equivalent to the growth clocked by the company in the past five years.\nOf course, there is a good chance that the company could grow at a faster pace thanks to the catalysts discussed above. That's why investors who haven't bought this growth stock yet can still consider adding Nvidia to their portfolios. The tech giant seems poised for much more upside over the next five years.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a top stock for years, but it recently became a household name due its graphics processing units (GPUs) powering generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Demand for Nvidia's chips has skyrocketed, and that's reflected in soaring revenue and profits. Investors quickly pounced on the opportunity, and Nvidia stock is up 783% over the past two years.\nLet's go back a little further and see where a $1,000 investment five years ago could have gotten you today.\nFive years ago, generative AI was a concept strictly for tech people, but Nvidia was already a top chipmaker. It created the GPU in 1999 and transformed the gaming industry, and its chips are used in various industries for data computing, including scientific applications and automotive. Because generative AI can be intensely consumer-facing, Nvidia has become a recognizable symbol of its power.\nLike most companies and industries, Nvidia has had its ups and downs. It gained 400% between the first two of the past five years, when the country was flooded with stimulus money and the markets were giddy with optimism. Then, it lost a full 50% of its value in 11 months due to the inflation and toppled markets that followed. Smart investors held on and are now reaping the benefits of buying a great stock and holding through periods of volatility.\nIf you'd invested $1,000 five years ago, which would have been just before the pandemic and the ensuing market chaos, you'd have a staggering $31,500 today.\nCan Nvidia do it again? In the long term, it has plenty of opportunities. There might be some short-term pressure since Nvidia already sports a high valuation and deals with building competition. So the road may be bumpy over the next couple of years. But if you invest in Nvidia today and hold on across Wall Street's potholes, you should be richly rewarded down the line.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Anyone who thought Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) sizzling momentum would go on forever without a hitch should now know better. A hitch has unquestionably arrived.\nSure, the high-flying artificial intelligence (AI) stock is still up close to 140% year to date. However, Nvidia stock has pulled back over 10%. Here's what history says could happen next.\nNvidia has fallen by double-digit percentages from its high plenty of times since its stock began trading publicly in 1999. The first one came only days after its initial public offering. However, within a few weeks, Nvidia shrugged off the temporary setback and marched to a new high.\nSeveral other pullbacks of 10% or more occurred during Nvidia's first year on the market. In each case, the stock bounced back. However, Nvidia's sell-offs weren't always short-lived. Between late 2001 and October 2002, shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker plunged nearly 90%. Nvidia didn't climb back to its previous high until December 2006.\nAnd that wasn't Nvidia's longest trough. The stock market sell-off that began in late 2007 sparked another huge sell-off of Nvidia. Although the worst was over by the latter part of 2008, it took the stock over eight years -- until May 2016 -- to recover.\nHowever, Nvidia always eventually bounced back after a major decline. Given enough time, the stock has a 100% rebound rate historically.\nInvestors shouldn't automatically conclude that history will repeat itself. Just because Nvidia has come back from big pullbacks in the past doesn't mean that it will necessarily do so again. Could this time be different for Nvidia?\nNvidia has never had a market cap of over $3 trillion before a double-digit percentage sell-off until now. The company is clearly at a different stage than it's ever been. Some could argue that Nvidia's valuation makes things different now than in the past.\nI question that premise, though. Based on several valuation metrics (including price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow), Nvidia isn't as expensive as it's been at other times in its history.\nThe factors that contributed to Nvidia's lengthy downturns in the past aren't problems today, either. While many tech stocks trade at a premium, valuations aren't at the excessive levels seen in the dot-com boom. There is no financial crisis like we saw in 2007 through 2009. Overall, the macroeconomic conditions are pretty good for Nvidia right now.\nNvidia's current double-digit decline is mainly due to concerns about China. Bloomberg reported last week that the Biden administration could further restrict exports of chipmaking equipment to China. Soon afterward, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested that Taiwan should pay the United States for defending it against attack. Although these developments are concerning for Nvidia, they don't rise to the level of the issues that have caused extended declines for the stock in the past.\nI think that history is on the side of a relatively quick rebound for Nvidia. But I'd also argue that investors should look to the company's future instead of its past. Nvidia's share price won't bounce back because it's always done so. It will bounce back if investors are convinced that growth prospects present a compelling case for buying the stock.\nOn that front, there's reason to be optimistic. Nvidia will soon launch new chips based on its Blackwell architecture. CEO Jensen Huang believes Blackwell will be the company's \"most successful product\" in its history. If he's right, the current pullback presents a great buying opportunity.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The best way to describe the hype Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) represents in people's minds is through a recent quote from company's own founder and CEO, Jensen Huang:\nThe next industrial revolution has begun companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center AI factories to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence.\"\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIn a world where artificial intelligence has turned into a commodity and become the new gold, and where every business will be searching for its share of the treasure, Nvidia will be selling the shovels. And Huang made it clear: the new shovels are the data centers.\nTo illustrate this point further, Nvidia's stock price reflects the AI rush it has been benefiting from.\nThe tech company operates through four business segments, all of which support its growth: Data Center (the largest one), Gaming and AI PC (the second largest), Professional Visualization and Automotive and Robotics.\nFirst, we will look at the financials with a focus on these four pillars of the company's growth.\nThe reason Nvidia is so attractive as a growth stock is not only its recent high growth rates, but the fact it is supported by all four business segments. All four divisions saw sales grow by at least double digits from a year ago.\nThe first-quarter financial results, which were released on May 22, reveal impressive growth rates. Nvidia broke the record of quarterly revenue with a $26 billion figure, up 18% from the fourth quarter and 262% from a year ago.\nIn the Data Center business, revenue hit a record $22.60 billion, up 23% from the previous quarter and 427% from a year ago. In the Gaming and AI PC business segment, sales were $2.60 billion, down 8% from the previous quarter but still up 18% from a year ago. In the Professional Visualization division, revenue was $427 million, down 8% from the previous quarter but up 45% from a year ago. Last but not least, sales in the Automotive and Robotics unit hit $329 million, up 17% from the previous quarter and up 11% from a year ago.\nEvery single business segment had at least double-digit growth. Given that there are four solid pillars supporting Nvidia's growth, it is unlikely that all of them will crash at the same time.\nNvidia is clearly valued like a high-growth stock would be. Using trailing metrics, the stock is trading at 40 times last 12-month revenue, around 65 times Ebitda and 76 times earnings per share, both in the highest range of the historical valuation of the stock.\nLooking ahead, the stock is trading at about 25 times forward revenue and 38 times forward Ebitda, which, despite being cheaper than a year ago, remains in the higher range of the historical valuation as well. A fairer valuation brings it closer to the GF Value of around $90 (on a post-split basis), which is a 30% to 40% discount to the current price and the price it was trading at toward the end of the first quarter of the year. It seems the excitement around the stock caused the market to overbuy, ignoring the slowing growth trend that is starting from this quarter onward.\nIndeed, the key risk here is that Nvidia is trading with an assumption of high growth, while the company's growth is expected to significantly slow down, which could cause a sharp contraction to its valuation, as is typically the case for growth stocks with fading growth.\nThe year-over-year revenue growth rate peaked in the fourth quarter, reaching 265%, and pulled back slightly to 262% in the first quarter. However, the stock is expected to only gain 109% in the second quarter, 72% in the third quarter, 55% in the fourth quarter and 36% in the first quarter of 2025. The downtrend is evident as the AI boom slows down, global economies potentially fall into a recession after a long tight monetary cycle and as competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) come after Nvidia's market share.\nThere is a second risk, however, which is what fueled the growth of Nvidia over the last several quarters: its exposure and overconcentration to a few companies, namely the Magnificent Seven. Indeed, Bloomberg data estimates that Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) makes up 15% of Nvidia's revenue, followed by Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) at 13%, Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) at 6% and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) at about 6%. This means that 40% of the company's revenue comes from four companies, which in turns means the latter have significant leverage in negotiating contracts with Nvidia while its competitors continue to catch up.\nHence, despite the company being high growth, its stretched valuation and customer concentration warrant caution.\nNvidia is selling the shovels to the gold miners, and there is an increasing number of them. Indeed, numerous partnerships announced during the last earnings release fuel optimism of renewed growth in the coming quarters.\nIn the Data Center segment, Nvidia announced Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) are going into production with Nvidia cuLitho to accelerate computational lithography, the semiconductor manufacturing industry's most compute-intensive workload. The company also expanded collaborations with Amazon's AWS, Alphabet's Google Cloud, Microsoft and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to advance generative AI innovation.\nAdditionally, the Data Center business partnered with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) MedTech to implement AI into surgery. For the Professional Visualization unit, Nvidia announced an expansion of the Siemens partnership and a new framework for the Apple Vision Pro.\nLast but not least, in the Automotive and Robotics division, Nvidia announced exciting partnerships with Chinese automakers BYD (BYDDY) and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) and American EV producer Lucid (NASDAQ:LUCD) to power their next-generation vehicle fleets.\nThis impressive pipeline shows Nvidia might have new growth catalysts up its sleeve that could help the stock outperform the broader market in the coming quarters.\nNvidia's astonishing ability to grow year after year and to find new sources and catalysts of growth makes the stock an attractive one to own in a growth-oriented portfolio. However, given the slowing growth and sales overconcentration risks, caution is advised.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "A surprisingly resilient economy and profit-filled AI boom are driving the United States\u2019 big tech giants toward a milestone that would have seemed impossible just a few decades ago. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple have all surpassed the $3 trillion market capitalization mark, and Google and Amazon are following close behind in the $2 trillion range.\nCombined, these five tech giants alone are now worth more than $14.5 trillion and make up roughly 32% of the S&P 500. For reference, in 2002, after the dot-com bubble burst, the total market capitalization of every U.S. stock was $11.1 trillion, according to Siblis Research data. Big tech\u2019s performance has been particularly impressive this year, with Nvidia, for example, surging from a $2 trillion market cap to a $3 trillion market cap in under 100 days.\nThat begs the question: which tech giant will hit the next big milestone, $4 trillion in market cap, first? Some bears argue that big tech companies\u2019 record run of performance can\u2019t continue forever, given their elevated valuations and the slowing economy, while the bulls believe this is just the beginning of a streak of AI-induced wins for big tech.\n\u201cI think, a year from now, we [will] have three $4 trillion market cap companies: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft,\u201d Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told Fortune.\nHe argued that many of his peers on Wall Street continue to underestimate the AI revolution and the health of the U.S. economy. \u201cUnless you have a telescope, you can't find a recession. And the Fed? Their next move is a cut not a hike. So, to me, all signs are bullish,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's 9 pm, and the party goes to 4 am\u2026the haters will hate, continuing to say that this is a bubble.\u201d\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nThere are, of course, a wide range of views on where big tech companies are headed, but many experts are convinced that chip giant Nvidia will be the first to reach the $4 trillion market cap mark, driven by the seemingly unending thirst for its AI-enabling hardware.\n\u201cThe first one to get there is likely to be the godfather of AI Jensen [Huang] and Nvidia, because they\u2019re the only game in town\u2014their GPUs are the new oil or gold in the tech world with no real competition,\u201d Ives said.\nNvidia stock has surged roughly 160% year to date and more than 3,000% over the past five years. That\u2019s led some analysts to warn that the tech giant\u2019s valuation has become stretched, and doesn\u2019t account for rising competition in the semiconductor market.\nAs David Trainer, founder and CEO of research firm New Constructs, told Fortune\u2019s Shawn Tully last month: \u201cNvidia\u2019s valuation is ridiculous. It\u2019s facing the same curse as Tesla. But when Tesla got profitable, loads of competitors entered the EV space, cutting margins and slowing sales. The same will happen with Nvidia.\u201d\nBut Ives noted that even though Nvidia\u2019s shares have surged, its revenues and earnings have followed suit. Nvidia raked in a record $26 billion in revenues and $14.8 billion in net income in the quarter that ended this April. In 2021, during the same quarter, the company had revenues of just $5.8 billion and net income of $1.9 billion.\nLouis Navellier, founder and chairman of family office Navellier & Associates, also brushed off the competition argument, claiming Nvidia essentially has a \u201cmonopoly\u201d on key AI chips which will lead to consistent sales and earnings growth for years to come. \u201cAnd, you know, Jensen is kind of like the new Elon, he\u2019s got kind of a cult status,\u201d he said, adding that will continue to drive retail investors in the stock.\nNvidia\u2019s market capitalization as of July 5: $3.14 trillion\nMicrosoft\u2019s booming cloud business and big investment into ChatGPT creator OpenAI have buoyed its shares over the past few years. But it\u2019s the company\u2019s diverse and sustainable revenue streams that will lead it to a $4 trillion market cap, according to Tim Pagliara, founder and chief investment officer of independent wealth management firm CapWealth.\nHe said Nvidia may briefly touch the $4 trillion milestone first, due to what he called the current AI \u201cmania,\u201d but Microsoft will be the \u201cmore sustainable\u201d $4 trillion company.\n\u201cThey're embracing AI, but they also have just a tremendous number of things in the pipeline. And I know as a small business owner, we just gladly keep paying them more per user per month for everything from Azure to some of the additional add ons that they have created for security and things like that,\u201d he added, referencing Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing business.\nPagliara thinks Microsoft\u2019s big tech rivals have riskier business models as well. Apple is dependent on consumers buying into its new iPhone offerings every few years, and Nvidia is benefiting from a lack of competition in the near term, he said. Meanwhile, Microsoft has multiple avenues for consistent revenue growth from the Azure cloud business and Office 365 to Windows and Linkedin.\nMarket cap: $3.48 trillion\nWhen it comes to a longer-term outlook, Apple is high on many analysts\u2019 lists because of its potential to use AI to get customers to upgrade their current phones and lure in more iPhone customers. It may not be the first to reach a $4 trillion market cap, but it will get there soon, these bulls say.\n\u201cI think over the next two, three years, the largest market cap that we will see is Apple, because they have 2.2 billion iOS devices,\u201d Ives predicted. \u201cConsumer AI is going to go through the walls for Cupertino\u2014they are only in the beginning of an AI-driven supercycle.\u201d\nLouis Navellier was also optimistic about Apple\u2019s future, but he said it will need a few \u201clittle breakthroughs\u201d to get more customers to buy new iPhones.\nHe pointed to new AI tools and the potential for folding iPhones as examples. \u201cI don't know if they're going to announce that in September, but if they do, it will be a $2,500 phone, and it will sell like crazy and send that stock soaring.\u201d\nMarket cap: $3.46 trillion\nThe Google parent\u2019s market cap is currently $2.36 trillion, leaving it well shy of the $4 trillion mark. Analysts said Alphabet will be able to capitalize on the AI revolution, but its missteps with hallucinations have left it behind, and its cloud business isn\u2019t performing as well as others. However, the search giant is taking talent from its peers in an attempt to catch up, recent reports have shown.\nIt\u2019s a similar story for Amazon, which just recently passed the $2 trillion milestone, and experts expect it will take time for share prices to nearly double. Wedbush\u2019s Ives argued that Amazon\u2019s cloud business, AWS, has also lost out to Microsoft. \u201c\u200b\u200bI think there was some hubris in underestimating what Nadella and Microsoft are doing, and with the crosstown rivals and in that 2-0-6 area code, it's been a bit of a gut punch for Amazon,\u201d he said.\nAnd when it comes to AI, Amazon is just \u201cbehind the eightball\u201d too, according to the veteran tech analyst. However, Ives noted that CEO Andy Jassy has made changes to the company\u2019s cloud business, and with a massive base of customers, Amazon should benefit more from AI moving forward.\nTo be sure, every tech giant on this list also faces risks. Antitrust regulations, cyber attacks, a slowing economy, and a reduction in AI spending should all be considered. But for now, the bulls remain bullish\u2013and they think you should be too.\n\u201cThe tech bears with their spreadsheets and valuations will stay in hibernation mode,\u201d Ives said. \u201cBut when everyone meets for breakfast at 6 am after this AI party. The bulls [will have] won and the bears just sound smart.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia Could Be Worth Nearly $50 Trillion In A Decade, Says Early Tesla, Amazon Investor: Nearly 2X That Of US Or 3X Of China's Current GDP",
        "Author": "  Kaustubh Bagalkote ",
        "Text": "A prominent tech investor predicted that NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) could achieve a market capitalization of nearly $50 trillion within the next decade.\nWhat Happened: James Anderson, an early investor in companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), expressed his bullish outlook on Nvidia\u2019s future potential, reported the Financial Times on Sunday. He suggested that the chipmaker\u2019s market cap could potentially surpass the combined value of the current S&P 500.\nDon't Miss:\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in a house-printing startup who\u2019s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry.\nGeneral Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share.\nAnderson\u2019s optimism stems from Nvidia\u2019s role in the burgeoning demand for AI chips, which are crucial for training and running advanced generative AI models. This demand has propelled Nvidia\u2019s shares to soar by 168% since the beginning of the year, pushing its market value above $3 trillion.\n\"The potential scale of Nvidia in the most optimistic outcome is both way higher than I've ever seen before and could lead to a market cap of double-digit trillions. This isn't a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia's lead is intact,\" Anderson said.\nFor context, Anderson\u2019s prediction of Nvidia hitting $50 trillion market capitalization would be nearly twice as much as the U.S.\u2019s current gross domestic product (GDP), which stands at $27.36 trillion, or nearly thrice as much as China\u2019s GDP of $17.79 trillion, according to data from the World Bank.\nDespite this remarkable growth, Anderson views Nvidia\u2019s potential as even greater, provided that artificial intelligence continues to deliver for customers and Nvidia maintains its lead in the industry.\nSee Also: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nAnderson, who now runs a $650 million fund at Lingotto Investment Management, believes that Nvidia\u2019s \u201cpersistent exponential progress, the competitive advantages in hardware and software, and the culture and leadership are exactly what we look for.\u201d\nHe also acknowledged that the path to this potential valuation would be volatile, with possible drawdowns of 35-40%. However, he expressed confidence in Nvidia\u2019s long-term prospects, stating that the company is at the forefront of solving serious problems in areas like autonomous driving, robotics, and drug discovery.\nAnderson projected that the actual growth in demand for data center AI chips was currently around 60% annually. Looking forward over the next decade, he estimated that sustained 60% growth in data center revenue alone, with unchanged margins, could lead to earnings of $1,350 per share and free cash flow of approximately $1,000 per share.\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield.\nAssuming a 5% free cash flow yield, this analysis suggests that Nvidia shares could potentially be valued at $20,000 in 10 years, implying a market capitalization of $49 trillion. Anderson assigned a probability of 10-15% to achieve this scenario, according to the report.\nWhy It Matters: The prediction from Anderson comes amid a broader context of excitement and caution in the market. The U.S. stock market has experienced a significant rally, largely driven by the promise of AI. This surge has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, with the S&P 500 index hitting new highs and the Nasdaq Composite index rising by 70% since the end of 2022.\nSee Also: This Income Stock Has Outperformed The S&P 500 For Over A Decade\nHowever, not everyone is optimistic. Craig Johnson, a managing director and chief market technician at Piper Sandler, has pointed out \u201cwarning flags\u201d in the market, suggesting that Nvidia might be in \u201cbubble-ish territory\u201d and hinting at a potential market pullback.\nEven Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, has acknowledged Nvidia\u2019s exceptional performance but forecasts \u201cshort-term indigestion\u201d for the company\u2019s business as customers reassess their AI strategies.\nDespite these concerns, some analysts remain bullish. Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, has a price target of $200 on Nvidia stock, citing the company\u2019s pivotal role in the AI space.\nAnderson gained prominence during his nearly four-decade tenure at Baillie Gifford. He oversaw its flagship Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which initially invested in Nvidia in 2016. His leadership played a pivotal role in transforming the Edinburgh-based private partnership into an unexpected standout in the tech investment sector.\nRead Next:\nRory McIlroy\u2019s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 \u2014 here\u2019s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100\nGen Z and Millennial millionaires couldn't care less for stocks and bonds \u2014 Here's what they're buying instead.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article Nvidia Could Be Worth Nearly $50 Trillion In A Decade, Says Early Tesla, Amazon Investor: Nearly 2X That Of US Or 3X Of China's Current GDP originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the hottest stock on the market due to its incredible rise thanks to unprecedented demand for artificial intelligence (AI). With the stock recently up around 160% this year, its rise has made many investors a lot of money.\nHowever, if you're going to be an Nvidia investor, there are three things you must know that could affect your perspective on the stock.\nAlthough Nvidia has some software products, it's not a software company. Its primary product is its graphics processing units (GPUs), which enable its users to train AI models. Because GPUs can process multiple calculations in parallel, they are effective at complex computing tasks. Combine that with the ability to hook hundreds or thousands together, and it makes sense that Nvidia's GPUs are flying off the shelf.\nHowever, times aren't always peachy at Nvidia.\nThe chip industry is known to be cyclical, as demand rises and falls based on a secondary trend. Nvidia's last two cyclical cycles were tied to cryptocurrency, and the company saw significant revenue drawdowns after the cycle was complete.\nHowever, Nvidia has always emerged a stronger company from its various cyclical drawdowns. This is key, as investors must weigh this success against the backdrop of another drawdown that is eventually coming.\nOnce AI computing demand is built out, Nvidia will undoubtedly see a drop in demand. The problem is, nobody knows if that's in the next quarter, next year, or the next decade. If it doesn't occur for a while, investing in Nvidia now could be smart. But investors could be in trouble if it's right around the corner.\nAfter a run-up like Nvidia's, it's no surprise that the stock has a premium price tag attached to it. But just how expensive is it?\nBecause Nvidia is a mature company, using the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a smart idea. Additionally, because Nvidia is experiencing significant change, the forward P/E ratio is also a useful metric, as the two combined show what expectations are built into the stock over the next 12 months.\nA valuation of 47 times forward earnings is incredibly expensive, especially considering the S&P 500 trades for around 22.7 times forward earnings. Because of Nvidia's premium status and top-tier execution, seeing the stock trade at a 30 times earnings multiple when the pandemonium has settled down isn't out of the question. But for Nvidia to reach that valuation, it must grow its earnings by 151%.\nWhile some may think that's easy, especially considering that Nvidia grew its earnings per share by 629% in Q1 of FY 2025 (ending April 28), it will start reaching quarters with tougher comparison figures. As a result, its growth rates won't look as impressive, even though they will still be rapid.\nWall Street analysts expect Nvidia to grow its earnings by 60% over the next 12 months. So it's not out of the question that the company must continue growing at its current pace for two years to return to a reasonable valuation.\nThat's a long time of sustained strong growth. But is it realistic?\nAlthough it seems like all anyone has talked about is AI this and AI that, it's because AI will be a life-altering product like the internet. Technology has barely scratched the surface of how AI can assist in daily tasks, and to power the next wave of innovation even more computing power will be needed.\nFurthermore, a GPU used in a data center lasts around five years, so eventually it will need to be replaced. This will fuel another wave of demand for Nvidia's GPUs, which could further extend Nvidia's growth.\nAs an investor, Nvidia's valuation scares me. But there is a case to be made that the stock could still be worth the price you're paying today if the growth extends out for another few years.\nIf you keep that in mind, Nvidia stock may be for you. Otherwise, if you invest in an index fund, you'll still have heavy Nvidia exposure because it makes up about 6.7% of the S&P 500.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "When the internet started to become mainstream three decades ago, the growth arc for businesses in America and around the globe completely changed. After decades of patiently waiting, Wall Street and investors have identified what they believe is the next breakthrough innovation that's going to alter the growth trajectory for corporate America: artificial intelligence (AI).\nAI relies on software and systems to handle tasks that would normally be assigned to humans. What makes this technology so appealing is the capacity for AI software and systems to learn and evolve over time without human intervention or oversight. This effectively gives AI utility in virtually all sectors and industries.\nThe addressable long-term potential of artificial intelligence isn't lost on Wall Street or its analysts. Most price targets from Wall Street pundits and financial institutions point to upside for market-leading AI stocks. But this doesn't mean the outlook for all AI stocks is equal.\nWhile most pundits expect the hardware kingpin of AI, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), to increase in value over the coming year, high-water price targets from select Wall Street analysts suggest two other AI stocks could more than double investor's money in the coming 12 months and leave Nvidia in the dust.\nAmong the more than three dozen analysts and pundits that have weighed in on Nvidia, none is more optimistic about its future than Rosenblatt's Hans Mosesmann.\nFollowing the completion of Nvidia's historic 10-for-1 stock split in early June, Mosesmann increased his and his firm's price target on the company to $200 per share from $140. This implies a valuation of nearly $5 trillion and would result in shares gaining an additional 59% from where they ended on July 5.\nMosesmann's lofty price target is based on Nvidia retaining its dominance in two key facets of the AI revolution. The first being its monopoly like market share of AI-driven graphics processing units (GPUs). The analysts at TechInsights found that Nvidia was responsible for 3.76 million of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs that shipped were shipped in 2023. With clear-cut compute advantages and a backlog of next-generation GPU architecture waiting in the wings (Blackwell and Rubin), Mosesmann anticipates Nvidia will be the go-to hardware provider for AI-accelerated data centers.\nMosesmann also expects Nvidia to reap the rewards of its CUDA platform, which is the toolkit developers use to build large language models. This software perfectly aligns with Nvidia's hardware monopoly to keep AI-focused businesses locked within its ecosystem of products and services.\nDespite this overwhelming euphoria surrounding Nvidia, the path forward for the company should be significantly bumpier than the previous 18 months.\nFor example, competition is cropping up at a rapid pace. In addition to fighting back against external AI-GPU developers, all four of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are developing AI chips for their data centers. Even if Nvidia's chips maintain their compute advantage, the sheer presence of additional AI-GPUs will minimize the scarcity that sent the price of Nvidia's GPUs into the stratosphere and weigh down its margins.\nWhat's more, history doesn't agree with a majority of Wall Street analysts. Including the advent of the internet, every next-big-thing innovation, technology, or trend over the last 30 years has worked its way through a bubble. Since no company has more directly benefited from the rise of AI than Nvidia, it would, presumably, be the likeliest to get clobbered if and when the AI bubble bursts.\nAlthough Nvidia's path forward could be bumpy, a pair of Wall Street analysts believe two other AI stocks can run circles around this artificial intelligence leader over the next year.\nThe first AI stock that has the ability to leave Nvidia in the dust, at least on a return basis over the next year, is China-based electric-vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NYSE: NIO). According to Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsiao, Nio can reach $10 per share, which would represent an increase of 116% from where shares ended on July 5.\nOne of the catalysts fueling Hsiao's optimism is Nio's rapid growth in production and deliveries. In particular, Nio has been averaging around 5,000 orders per week, or in the neighborhood of 20,000 deliveries per month. Moving past the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to stringent lockdowns in China, has unraveled the supply chain kinks that had previously held back Nio's production expansion.\nTo add to this point, Nio has completed the transition of its fleet to its new NT 2.0 platform. This new platform incorporates a number of advanced driver assistance system upgrades, including autonomous driving capabilities, which is one aspect of Nio's AI ties. Since transitioning to NT 2.0, demand for Nio's EVs has picked up.\nHsiao and his team are also excited about the 2024 launch of Nio's second vehicle brand, known as Onvo. Whereas Nio has predominantly focused on higher-earning consumers with its existing lineup, Onvo is a family oriented battery-EV brand with a lower price point that can be a more direct competitor to the likes of Tesla in China.\nThe final piece of the puzzle is that it's swimming in capital. The company closed out the March quarter with approximately $6.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various investments. This gives Nio ample runway to introduce new EVs and ramp up production.\nThe caveat to all of the above is that building a car company from the ground up is no easy task. Nio is still burning cash and not particularly close to generating a profit. While Onvo and its battery-as-a-service subscription might be able to lift margins, Nio remains a work-in-progress that'll require patience from its shareholders.\nThe second artificial intelligence stock expected to more than double investor's money and leave Nvidia eating its dust is yet another China-based company, Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU). According to analyst Fawne Jiang of Benchmark, Baidu has a path to $180 per share -- a 102% gain from its closing price on July 5 -- over the next 12 months.\nBaidu is best-known for its market-leading internet search engine. Based on data from GlobalStats, the company's search engine accounted for about a 53% share of internet search in the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product in June. With few exceptions, Baidu has controlled a 50% to 85% monthly share of internet search in China dating back 10 years.\nAs the go-to internet search engine in China, it's often able to command substantial ad-pricing power from businesses. Although China's bounce-back from the COVID-19 pandemic has been filled with more potholes than initially anticipated, it's tough to envision Baidu struggling for long when it retains a clear moat in advertising.\nHowever, it's Baidu's ancillary AI operations that could be its biggest growth driver for the remainder of the decade (if not well beyond). Baidu's AI Cloud is the fourth-largest cloud infrastructure service platform in China, based on total spending. Enterprise spending on cloud services is in its early stages of ramping up, and cloud-service margins provide far more pop for Baidu than advertising margins.\nAdditionally, Baidu is the parent of Apollo Go, the world's leading autonomous ride-hailing service. As of April 19, Apollo Go had surpassed 6 million cumulative rides since its inception.\nSimilar to Nio, Baidu is also sitting on quite the treasure chest of available capital. It ended the first quarter with around $26 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various investments at its disposal. Given Baidu's forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 7.5, the risk-versus-reward profile for the company would certainly favor upside.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Owns 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks, and These 2 Have Soared the Most",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio ",
        "Text": "Nvidia was a $360 billion company at the start of 2023. A mere 18 months later, it's now worth $3.1 trillion, making it the world's third-largest company behind Microsoft and Apple.\nNvidia designs the most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which developers use to build, train, and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) models. In the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), those chips sent the company's data center revenue skyrocketing 427% year over year to a record $22.6 billion.\nNvidia is now spreading some of that wealth by investing in smaller AI companies, a strategy that supports the industry's growth and could lead to a nice return for its own shareholders if the bets pay off.\nAccording to Nvidia's latest form 13F, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, the chipmaker holds a stake in the following AI companies:\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM), which built the architecture most semiconductor companies use to design their chips.\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), which develops voice recognition and conversational AI software.\nNano-X Imaging, which uses AI to produce better results from medical imaging.\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals, which uses AI to aid in drug discovery.\nIt invested in each company at the end of 2023. Arm Holdings received the largest investment at around $147 million, which is more than Nvidia deployed into the other three stocks combined. Today, that Arm position is worth $311 million thanks to a 130% gain in the stock in 2024 already.\nNvidia invested around $3.7 million in SoundHound AI, and its stock has climbed 87% year to date, which now places that value at $6.7 million.\nArm and SoundHound are the standout performers, and here's why that could continue.\nNvidia tried to buy Arm for $40 billion in 2020, but it was forced to abandon the deal because regulators said it was anticompetitive. It's no surprise, because Arm built the architecture that many leading semiconductor makers use to design their chips \u2014 including Nvidia and one of its closest competitors, Advanced Micro Devices.\nArm specializes in central processing units (CPUs), which are used in personal computers (PCs), smartphones, and even some of the GPUs designed by Nvidia to increase efficiency. Its upcoming GB200, for example, is configured with a combination of two GPUs and two Arm-based CPUs, and it's capable of inferencing AI models at five times the speed of its flagship H100, which currently dominates the data center market. This will drive costs down for developers, who often pay for computing capacity on a by-the-minute basis.\nAn estimated 99% of smartphone CPUs also use Arm's architecture, so the company is overwhelmingly dominant in that segment. Plus, Microsoft is integrating AI into the Windows operating system, which is triggering a new wave of demand for next-generation chips from computer manufacturers. Arm CEO Rene Haas believes his company can capture a 50% share of the Windows PC market within five years.\nThe company likely has a bright future, but investors should be wary of its lofty valuation before they rush to buy the stock. It generated $3.2 billion in revenue during fiscal 2024 (ended March 31), and based on its market capitalization of $169.8 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 53.\nThat makes it even more expensive than Nvidia stock, with its P/S ratio of 38.7. Keep in mind, Nvidia is expected to nearly double its revenue in its current fiscal 2025, whereas Arm is projected to grow its revenue by just 23%. It doesn't make much sense to pay a higher valuation for Arm relative to Nvidia, when Arm is growing at a much slower pace.\nNvidia bought Arm stock at a much cheaper price than where it trades today, so it might be best for investors to wait for a pullback before joining the party.\nSoundHound AI developed a suite of conversational AI software tools that have been deployed by businesses in the hospitality, restaurant, and automotive industries. They can hold entire spoken conversations with a user, making them extremely useful in high-pressure settings where fast answers are required to serve customers.\nThe restaurant industry is using SoundHound's new Employee Assist tool to give workers a helpful virtual assistant they can call upon at any time. It understands store policies, and it can even offer employees guidance when making menu items. The technology is also used to take customer orders in a drive-thru lane, over the phone, and in a store.\nWhite Castle, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Krispy Kreme are just some of the chains using it. With help from its acquisition of restaurant AI company SYNQ3, SoundHound is now in 10,000 locations with 100,000 more in the pipeline, and management says its addressable market includes 1 million restaurants and 30 million other businesses across North America. So the company has barely scratched the surface of an opportunity that could be worth $100 billion.\nSoundHound's in-car voice assistant is used by leading automotive brands like Honda, Hyundai, and Stellantis (which owns Jeep, Dodge, and Chrysler). And the company recently partnered with Nvidia's Drive platform to refine the voice assistant by delivering it on the edge, which means users won't need network connectivity to access it. That improves privacy and enables it to work even in geographic areas with no network service.\nSoundHound generated $11.6 million in revenue during the recent fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended March 31), representing 73% growth from the year-ago period. Its order backlog also soared 80% to a record $682 million, so there is plenty of demand in the pipeline. Considering its stock trades at a P/S of 19.5, it looks like a much better value than Arm.\nHowever, SoundHound lost $33 million during the first quarter. Given that it has only $117 million in cash on hand, the company will probably have to raise money by selling equity, which will dilute existing shareholders. Therefore, this stock should be reserved for investors with a high risk tolerance.\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Arm Holdings wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Although most investors are captivated by the long-term potential of artificial intelligence (AI), companies enacting stock splits are an equally hot trend on Wall Street.\nA stock split is an event that allows publicly traded companies an opportunity to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count. It's superficial in the sense that stock splits don't affect a company's market valuation or operating performance.\nThe two variations of stock splits are forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are purposely reducing their nominal share price to make it more affordable for everyday investors and/or their employees. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split is aimed at increasing a company's share price, often with the goal of meeting continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.\nAlthough some reverse-stock splits can be long-term winners, most investors tend to focus their attention on public companies conducting forward splits. High-flying stocks in need of a forward split are usually out-executing and out-innovating their competition.\nSince 2024 began, in the neighborhood of a dozen high-profile companies have announced and/or completed a stock split -- but none have garnered more attention than AI titan Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in January 1999, Nvidia has completed six forward splits. The latest was announced by the company's board on May 22 -- a 10-for-1 stock split -- with an effective date of June 7. At the snap of a finger, Nvidia's share price of more than $1,200 was adjusted to a little north of $120.\nThe reason Nvidia required its largest stock split since going public has everything to do with its AI dominance.\nSince the start of 2023, Nvidia's AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the undisputed standard in high-compute data centers. By some estimates, the company holds a virtual monopoly on the AI-GPUs that were shipped for use in enterprise data centers last year.\nOn top of being the preferred hardware provider for AI-accelerated data centers, demand for the company's H100 GPU has overwhelmed supply. Even with world-leading foundry services company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rapidly upping its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity for high-bandwidth memory packaging, Nvidia is nowhere close to meeting enterprise demand for its chips. As a result, it's been able to meaningfully increase the selling price of its GPUs, which has provided a hearty boost to its adjusted gross margin.\nNvidia has plans to retain its first-mover advantages, as well. While most external competitors are playing catch-up to the H100, Nvidia is expected to release its next-generation AI-GPU architecture, known as Blackwell, later this year. Blackwell offers computational improvements in six areas, including quantum computing, generative AI solutions, and engineering simulation, to name a few. In June, CEO Jensen Huang teased the eventual rollout of its Rubin GPU architecture by 2026.\nNvidia's 10-for-1 stock split has laid a path for other fast-growing, market-leading businesses to follow. Interestingly enough, two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" might be next to answer the call.\nAs a quick refresher, the Magnificent Seven account for seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in America. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nNvidia\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia have market valuations in excess of $3 trillion; Alphabet and Amazon are valued at north of $2 trillion; Meta is worth close to $1.4 trillion; and while Tesla is currently below $1 trillion, it's previously topped this psychological level.\nAmong Nvidia's six peers in the Magnificent Seven, two are primed to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks.\nThe first Magnificent Seven component that's long overdue for a stock split is the only member that's yet to ever complete one. I'm talking about social media colossus Meta Platforms. Shares of the company have risen by more than 1,300% since its debut in 2012, with the company's stock tipping the scales at roughly $540, as of the closing bell on July 5.\nThough Meta is among the basket of companies undeniably benefiting from the AI revolution, it would be well-insulated if the AI bubble were to burst at some point in the future. That's because nearly 98% of Meta's sales can be traced to advertising on its social media platforms.\nMeta is the parent company behind Facebook, the most-visited social platform globally, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. These are some of the world's most-downloaded social apps, and they collectively helped to attract 3.24 billion daily active users during the March-ended quarter. Businesses are well aware that no other social media company offers access to more eyeballs than Meta, which is what affords the company such exceptional ad-pricing power.\nSomething else working in Meta's favor is its treasure trove of cash. As of March 31, Meta was sitting on more than $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. To boot, it's also generated north of $76 billion in cash from its operations over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has the luxury of betting big on AI data centers, the metaverse, and augmented/virtual reality devices thanks to his company's immense cash-flow generation.\nWith Meta's stock well over $500 and the company's long-term growth prospects improving, its very first stock split would seem to be in the cards.\nThe second Magnificent Seven member that looks ready to follow in Nvidia's footsteps and become Wall Street's newest stock-split stock is software and cloud juggernaut Microsoft.\nSince its March 1986 IPO, Microsoft has conducted nine forward splits. However, the last stock split it completed was back in February 2003! With the world's largest company by market cap closing the July 5 session at $467.56 per share, the ingredients are on the table for Microsoft to announce a stock split.\nThe beauty of Microsoft's operating model is that it relies on sizable margins from its legacy operations to fund its high-growth initiatives. Although iconic software segments like Windows and Office aren't growing like they once were, the exceptional moats and margins associated with these divisions provide Microsoft with plenty of cash to reinvest in the cloud and AI, or perhaps deploy when making acquisitions.\nThe bread-and-butter to Microsoft's future looks to be cloud infrastructure service platform Azure. While Microsoft has AI and cloud ties in other operating segments, Azure is consistently its fastest-growing segment -- 31% constant-currency sales growth in the fiscal third quarter (ended March 31). Azure ranks second to Amazon Web Services in global cloud infrastructure service market share.\nSimilar to Meta Platforms, Microsoft's balance sheet and cash-flow generation afford it the ability to take risks that few other companies can match. It closed out the fiscal third quarter with $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and has generated $110 billion in operating cash flow over the TTM period. This is what allowed Microsoft to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard last year for $68.7 billion in an all-cash deal.\nWhat better way for the world's largest public company to excite Wall Street and its shareholders than by being the next Magnificent Seven component to announce a stock split.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has done a lot over the past five years. Five years ago, it was nearing the bottom of a cycle thanks to a collapse in the cryptocurrency market. Now, it's reaching new highs as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand for creating artificial intelligence (AI) models.\nWhile it would have been nearly impossible to predict all of the places Nvidia has gone over the past five years, I'm going to speculate on where it could go in the next five years. Although this prediction will likely be wrong in some ways, it's good at least to develop an investment thesis for the market's most dominant company right now.\nNvidia's GPUs are -- hands down - the best in class. There's a reason why all of the biggest companies that provide the tools to make AI models or create them in-house are using Nvidia GPUs nearly exclusively. However, that exclusivity may be dwindling.\nBecause GPUs can do multiple calculations in parallel, they are fantastic for creating AI models. However, if the only thing that the GPU will be doing is training AI models, more efficient hardware is available. For instance, Google Cloud's tensor processing unit (TPU) is more effective at training AI models than a GPU if the workload is set up to be run on a TPU.\nThis still leaves a use case for GPUs, which are fantastic for running initial models. However, custom-designed AI chips like TPUs can exceed the performance of GPUs when they are used for a specific purpose.\nGoogle Cloud isn't the only one creating these custom chips. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Meta Platforms are also creating their own custom-designed chips. This could present a problem for Nvidia over the next five years, as many of its largest customers are bringing these designs in-house. Demand for Nvidia GPUs will still likely be high, but it may not be as high as it is now.\nOn the plus side for Nvidia, all of the record-setting number of GPUs it has sold over the past year will eventually need to be replaced. While there is no hard and fast rule, it's common for these GPUs to last between three and five years in a data center. After that, they'll either need to be replaced (whether by some in-house design or Nvidia's latest product) or decommissioned.\nThe computing power to run these models continuously isn't going away, so decommissioning these GPUs isn't an option. This will create essentially a long-term subscription effect, and five years from now, Nvidia will likely see another wave of replacing the products it is selling right now.\nThat's not to mention all of the technological improvements that will likely be made from now until then, as new chip technology (like Taiwan Semiconductor's 2-nanometer chip technology that will be more efficient than the previous generation) will create more powerful and efficient GPUs that will help its users out over the long run.\nBut is all of that already baked into the stock price?\nIt's no secret that Nvidia's stock is expensive. The shares trade at 73 times trailing and 46 times forward earnings, which means significant growth is already priced into the stock.\nHowever, Nvidia's record margins are not often discussed. Nvidia's near-60% profit-margin levels are unbelievable and are a primary reason why many companies are starting to design their chips in-house.\nBecause demand for Nvidia's GPUs is so high right now, the company can afford to charge a premium for its products. Eventually, that won't be the case, and its profit margins will likely fall over the next five years.\nWhen that happens, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio will increase due to earnings either growing at a slower pace or falling. This is a huge risk associated with the stock, as the market believes Nvidia's revenue will keep going straight up forever.\nWhile demand for Nvidia's products will likely remain elevated, don't be surprised when Nvida faces challenges with in-house solutions in the next few years. There's an old saying that a company's margins are a competitor's opportunity, and when Nvidia's margins reach these levels, there's bound to be competition soon.\nAs a result, Nvidia's stock may face some pressure over the next five years. This unbelievable demand boom won't last forever, and the opportunity is just too large for every company to sit still and watch Nvidia take their money.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw a significant share price rise of 70% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The recent share price gains has brought the company back closer to its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s take a look at NVIDIA\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n View our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nAccording to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 74.56x is currently well-above the industry average of 31.27x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since NVIDIA\u2019s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. NVIDIA's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? NVDA\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NVDA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nIn light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

        "Title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying 2 Supercharged Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine ",
        "Text": "Many investors see Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) as the quintessential artificial intelligence (AI) stock because its chips provide the computing horsepower needed to train the most advanced AI systems, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Tesla's full self-driving software.\nHowever, some hedge fund billionaires sold Nvidia stock during the first quarter, while purchasing shares of Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and/or Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), two supercharged AI stocks with year-to-date returns of 59% and 198%, respectively.\nLouis Bacon of Moore Capital Management sold 2,006 shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 19%. Meanwhile, Bacon started a small position in Super Micro Computer.\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management sold 720,000 shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 35%. Meanwhile, Englander increased his positions in Palantir and Super Micro Computer by 4% and 235%, respectively.\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 2.9 million shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 68%. Meanwhile, Laffont increased his position in Palantir by 40%.\nTrades made by Israel Englander are especially noteworthy because Millennium Management handily beat the S&P 500 over the last three years , and it ranks as the second-best performing hedge fund of all-time as measured by net gains since inception. Here's what investors should know about Palantir and Supermicro.\nPalantir specializes in data analytics. Its software lets government and commercial clients integrate data, develop artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models, and build applications that lean on those data sets and models to improve decision-making. Palantir recently introduced its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), a product that brings support for large language models and generative AI to its existing software.\nCertain industry analysts have praised the company for its technological prowess. Forrester Research ranked Palantir Foundry as the best AI/ML platform in a report published in July 2022. And Dresner Advisory Services ranked Palantir as a leader in the AI/ML and data science market in a report published in August 2023.\nHowever, other analysts are skeptical. Rishi Jaluria of RBC Capital says conversations with industry observers and company employees have led to the conclusion that Palantir does not offer \"anything truly differentiated when it comes to generative AI.\"\nPalantir reported reasonably good financial results in the first quarter, beating estimates on the top line and meeting expectations on the bottom line. Its customer count increased 42% to 554, and the average existing customer spent 11% more. In turn, revenue increased 21% to $634 million, the third consecutive sequential acceleration, and non-GAAP earnings increased 60% to $0.08 per diluted share.\nCFO Dave Glazer said the commercial segment benefited from \"unprecedented demand driven by momentum from AIP.\" However, the stock still slipped 7% following the first-quarter report because management guided for full-year revenue growth of 20%, implying a slight deceleration in the coming quarters. Analysts anticipated full-year revenue growth of 22%.\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Palantir to grow adjusted earnings per share at 22% annually through 2026. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 97 times earnings look very expensive. Investors should be cautious with this stock. Personally, I plan to avoid Palantir until earnings growth accelerates or the valuation improves.\nSuper Micro Computer designs high-performance computing platforms for enterprise and cloud data centers. Its portfolio includes servers and storage systems, ranging from individual devices to full rack solutions. Its products can be optimized for use cases like artificial intelligence and 5G infrastructure, and they feature chips like Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) and Intel central processing units (CPUs).\nImportantly, Supermicro is the market leader in AI servers due to manufacturing prowess and its building-block approach to product development. To elaborate, nearly half of its workforce are engineers, and it handles most research and development internally. \"Our engineering aptitude, coupled with our internal manufacturing capability, enables rapid prototyping and product roll-out.\"\nAdditionally, Supermicro's modular product design reduces time to market, and affords clients flexibility in designing custom solutions. It can \"quickly assemble a broad portfolio of solutions by leveraging common building blocks across product lines.\" In other words, Supermicro can rapidly integrate the latest CPUs, GPUs, and memory into preassembled server chassis, such that it often beats competitors to market by two to six months.\nIndeed, Supermicro \"anticipates being first-to-market in deploying full rack clusters featuring Nvidia Blackwell GPUs.\" That is advantageous because businesses are eager to purchase AI hardware, so they are turning to the server maker that brings computing products to market at the fastest clip. As a result, Supermicro's AI server market share is expected to reach 23% by the end of 2024, up from 10% at the beginning of the year.\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Supermicro to grow earnings per share at 48% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 47 times earnings look very reasonable. Indeed, it gives a PEG ratio \u2014 the price-to-earnings ratio divided by the forecasted earnings growth \u2014 of roughly 1. For context, using the same methodology, Palantir currently has a PEG ratio of 4.4.\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock soared more than 500% over the past three years, prompting investors to wonder if it would be ripe for a slowdown 2024. But enthusiasm about this artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader continued, and the stock surged nearly 150% in the first half. This is as the company reported triple-digit gains in earnings and prepared for the launch of a whole new architecture, known as Blackwell, later this year.\nMeanwhile, to make this high-flying stock more accessible to a broader range of investors, Nvidia completed a 10-for-1 stock split a few weeks ago. This brought the per-share price down from more than $1,000 to about $120. Now, as the second half of the year starts to unfold, investors are wondering if the stock performance slowdown some anticipated will happen -- or if this top stock will continue to roar higher and even reach $200. Is Nvidia heading to $200 in the second half? Let's find out.\nFirst, a quick bit about why Nvidia stock has skyrocketed in recent years -- after all, there are plenty of chipmakers out there. Nvidia's success is due to the top performance of its graphics processing units (GPUs), or chips used to power AI tasks. They are recognized as the fastest around, and on top of this, the company has developed an entire ecosystem of products and services, meaning customers can rely on Nvidia for all of their AI needs.\nNvidia's AI portfolio is available through the major cloud companies, making it easy to find and access these top products and services.\nAll of this has helped Nvidia's revenue to soar to records quarter after quarter. In the most recent three-month period, Nvidia reported $26 billion in total revenue, driven by AI demand. This is more than double the company's full year revenue as recently as in the 2020 fiscal year. So the AI boom has driven enormous growth at Nvidia, and that's why investors have piled into the stock.\nNow, let's consider the company's share price, about $121 as of this writing. Wall Street's average estimate calls for a 10% gain within the coming 12 months, but at least one of the most bullish analysts predicts the stock will advance 65% to $200 within that time period. Hans Mosesmann, a Rosenblatt analyst, recently raised his price target to that level from $140 -- that would bring Nvidia to almost a $5 trillion valuation from $2.9 trillion right now. Today, the market's most valuable company is Microsoft, with a market cap of more than $3.2 trillion.\nThough this may seem like a big potential jump, especially if we look at market value, it's important to remember that Nvidia continues to grow in the triple digits. The company predicts revenue of about $28 billion in the second quarter, which would represent an increase of more than 100% from the year-earlier period. And Nvidia has a huge catalyst ahead, the release of its Blackwell architecture and chip -- demand already has exceeded supply and Nvidia expects this trend to continue into next year.\nAll of this means it's very possible Nvidia could reach $200 a year from now. What about in the second half of this year though? Nvidia is likely to gain, maybe even in the double digits, buoyed by optimism about the Blackwell release and ongoing growth. But I wouldn't expect the stock to reach $200 so quickly. Some investors may wait to monitor the Blackwell release and see how it translates into earnings growth.\nWhat does all of this mean for you as an investor? It actually doesn't matter whether Nvidia reaches $200 this year, next year, or a bit later. What's most important is Nvidia's ability to maintain its AI leadership and generate earnings growth over time -- if the company can do this, there's reason to be optimistic about long-term stock performance. And, right now, considering Nvidia's solid AI platform and plans for annual innovation, there's reason to be optimistic about this top AI stock over the long run.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Ethan Feller ",
        "Text": "Although voices of doubt continue to rise, the artificial intelligence boom continues. Just this week, FY26 sales estimates for Nvidia\u00a0NVDA\u00a0have again rocketed higher, with a UBS analyst raising the top line forecast to $204 billion.\nFor reference, annual sales at Nvidia in 2022 were just $26 billion and in the trailing twelve months were $80 billion.\nBecause of the huge capex spending on AI infrastructure from other big tech companies, Nvidia has been a huge beneficiary, and experienced reoccurring earnings and sales upgrades. Here I will share three reasons why Nvidia is still a worthy investment at current levels, and share two market-beating stocks (Dell Technologies\u00a0DELL\u00a0and Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0AMD) also set to benefit from AI.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor investors that want exposure to artificial intelligence, Nvidia stock is the most logical way to express it. As the technology is still in a nascent period, infrastructure investments dominate the market.\nWith its advanced GPUs, Nvidia is the only game in town for tech companies that need to up their computing power. This \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d advantage has been the game changer for Nvidia and the reason why investors keep gobbling up the stock.\nIn the price action chart below, we can see Nvidia stock gapped higher this morning, breaking out from a technical bull flag. This is another win for the bulls, and I would not be surprised to see NVDA stock make another new all-time high in the near future.\nImage Source: TradingView\nAfter almost two years, Nvidia still maintains a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.\nI look at the Zacks rank every morning, and Nvidia has sat on it longer than any other stock I have seen. The continuous revisions higher to its earnings and sales estimates is truly a sight to behold and I certainly haven\u2019t seen anything like it before.\nIn just the last month, earnings estimates have again been upgraded.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nToday, Nvidia is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 50.7x, which is admittedly a relatively high level. However, Nvidia has long maintained a premium valuation, and this is just above its 10-year median of 42.5x.\nIt is also worth noting that EPS are forecast to grow at an incredible rate over the next 3-5 years. Analysts are projecting annual growth of 37.5% for profits, bolstering the elevated valuation.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nUnderstandably for some investors, it is challenging psychologically to buy a stock like Nvidia. And really the best way to play this AI boom, is through a basket of stocks.\nTwo additional companies that are riding the AI boom are Dell Technologies and Advanced Micro Devices.\nDell Technologies currently enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating and is on the verge of a major technical breakout.\nJust this morning, DELL stock cleared an upper level of resistance, possibly giving the green light to investors looking to buy the stock.\nImage Source: TradingView\nWhile AMD currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting a flat earnings revision trend, it has very impressive growth estimates, nonetheless.\nSales growth is expected to accelerate next year to 25%, while EPS are expected to grow 33% annually over the next 3-5 years. Like both DELL and NVDA, AMD also shows strong momentum, which picked up in the last week. The stock has rallied nearly 10% in just the last three trading days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nThe future of artificial intelligence is undeniably bright, and Nvidia stands to be a major beneficiary. With its powerful GPUs and dominant market share, Nvidia offers a compelling way to gain exposure to this booming industry. While the stock's valuation is high, strong earnings growth forecasts help justify the premium.\nHowever, for investors hesitant about Nvidia's price tag, Dell Technologies and Advanced Micro Devices offer attractive alternatives. Both companies are well-positioned to capitalize on the AI boom, boasting strong growth potential and positive momentum.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is falling in Wednesday's trading. The company's share price was down 5.5% of 2:45 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index had fallen 2.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 3.3%.\nNvidia stock is losing ground in conjunction with recent earnings reports from two of the world's biggest and most influential companies. Alphabet and Tesla each issued second-quarter results and guidance yesterday, and the reports kicked off a substantial pullback across the stock market.\nEarnings season is underway, and Alphabet and Tesla were the first members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" to report earnings. The group, which also includes Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms, is highly influential when it comes to shaping overall stock market sentiment. Unfortunately, Wall Street wasn't impressed with either of yesterday's most high-profile quarterly reports.\nWhile Alphabet's Q2 report arrived with sales and earnings that beat Wall Street's targets, the company expects that costs will rise in the near term. Management expects the business's operating income margin will slip on a sequential basis due to increased infrastructure investments and depreciation. All in all, it was actually a very strong second quarter for the Google parent, but a moderate delay for profit growth seems to have spooked the market.\nTesla's report was more concerning. While the company managed to post revenue of $25.5 billion and beat the average analyst estimate by $760 million in the quarter, profits fell short. The company posted non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $0.52, missing Wall Street's target for per-share earnings of $0.62. Price cuts have helped sales, but margins are slipping, and it looks like the business could face some continued inventory issues.\nAlphabet stock was down 4.9% as of this writing. Meanwhile, Tesla was down 10.9%.\nBut there was actually some good news for Nvidia in both of these reports. Google Cloud revenue rose 29% year over year to reach $10.35 billion in Q2, which tracks with demand for the GPU leader's tech continuing to be robust. While the market was concerned about Alphabet's rising infrastructure spending, there's a fair chance this is actually a bullish signal for Nvidia.\nTesla is also spending heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) and will continue to do so according to comments in its quarterly call. With growth for the company's auto business stalling, investors aren't thrilled with the costs associated with perfecting autonomous driving and other artificial intelligence initiatives. But it seems unlikely that CEO Elon Musk will let off the gas, and the company should continue to be an eager Nvidia customer.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Prediction: This Move From Nvidia in the Second Half Will Be Much Bigger Than the Stock Split",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has soared over the past few years, and the stock added to gains in recent times when it announced something a lot of investors had been waiting for: a stock split. The company decided to launch a 10-for-1 split to bring its shares down to a level that would make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy. These operations involve the issuance of more shares to current holders to make that happen.\nPrior to the operation, Nvidia surged to more than $1,000 a share \u2014 a level that may be a psychological barrier for some investors and a difficult buy for those aiming to take a small position. Now, with Nvidia shares trading around $120, these problems have disappeared. So, though stock splits aren't catalysts for share performance, they can represent a positive move for a company.\nBut Nvidia's big moves this year aren't over. In fact, Nvidia has something major planned for the second half. My prediction is this move from the artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant will be much bigger than the stock split \u2014 and offer you a great reason to buy the stock. Let's check out what's ahead.\nOf course, gaining access to Nvidia for a lower per-share price, thanks to the stock split, is exciting, but it's important to remember that splits don't change a company's valuation: Nvidia isn't any cheaper today than it was prior to the split. In fact, a stock split doesn't change anything fundamental.\nThis upcoming move, however, will. First, a bit of background. Nvidia already is the world's AI chip leader, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) holding 80% share of the market. This is because Nvidia's GPUs are the fastest around, powering critical AI tasks like training and inferencing \u2014 the processes that help large language models do their job of solving complex tasks.\nNvidia also sells a variety of related AI products and services that make it the go-to destination for those launching an AI project. All of this has helped the company increase revenue and net income in the triple digits quarter after quarter.\nNow, moving along to my prediction: Nvidia's upcoming launch of its Blackwell architecture and best chip yet is much bigger news for the company and could represent a significant catalyst for the stock in the near term as well as over time as this platform adds to revenue.\nBlackwell could be a game changer because it represents a whole new way of powering AI, achieving incredible performance at a cost and energy consumption that's as much as 25 times lower than Hopper, the previous system. This is a critical feature because this savings reduces an AI customer's overall costs, potentially making the Nvidia system the most economical choice over time.\nBlackwell includes six transformative innovations, including the world's most powerful chip; the next generation Nvidia NVLink to offer high-speed communication among as many as 576 GPUs; a system of preventative maintenance to maximize system function; and more. And the Blackwell GPU offers as much as four-times-faster training and 30-times-faster inference than Nvidia's current leading chip, the H100.\nAnd now the really good news is this: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply, and he expects this to continue into next year. The launch strategy, making Blackwell available in more than 100 original equipment manufacturer and original design manufacturer systems, could ensure a strong start. All of this is reason to be optimistic about the platform's debut and its contribution to revenue in the coming quarters.\nThe Blackwell launch also may reassure investors who worry about rivals taking market share from the chip giant because it should set Nvidia significantly ahead.\nSo, even though Nvidia made headlines for its stock split in recent times, the upcoming launch of Blackwell is much bigger news \u2014 and news that could help this already top-performing AI stock continue its gains in the second half and beyond. And that makes Nvidia a great buy now, even after its 150% increase in the first half of the year.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "There has been an ongoing rotation in the stock market, and one of the losers has been previously high-flying Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares of the leading artificial intelligence (AI) chip and software maker continued to drop on Tuesday.\nToday, shares fell more than 8% before paring some of that drop. At the intraday low of about $102.5 per share, the stock was down more than 25% from its recent June intraday high of more than $140. As of 2:15 p.m. ET, shares were still lower on the day by 5.6%.\nBut a sector rotation might not be the only factor driving the drop. It's true that investors are moving out of the large tech companies and into previously lagging small-cap stocks as they prepare for the first interest rate cuts since 2020.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has also been selling the stock, and sometimes that spooks investors. Especially since the stock has more than doubled year to date, even after the recent decline. Huang has sold more than 3 million shares since mid-June at an average price of about $126 per share, reports Barron's.\nBut insider sales can be made for more reasons than just stock valuation. In fact, Huang's sales have been made through a prearranged trading plan known as Rule 10b5-1. That allows company insiders to sell a planned amount of stock at a scheduled time or set intervals.\nInvestors might be seeing Huang's sales as a sign it could also be time to de-risk their positions as well. Nvidia won't announce its fiscal second-quarter results until Aug. 28, but investors are already watching earnings reports in the sector this week.\nNvidia shares will likely react to what other prominent tech companies in the artificial intelligence sector like Microsoft and Advanced Micro Devices say about AI investments and demand for chips when each company reports after today's closing bell. Some investors would rather avoid the volatility, and they look to be selling Nvidia stock again today.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jen-Hsun Huang has been selling shares of his company's stock over the past two months, including 840,000 shares last week worth $59.3 million. The CEO has taken advantage of the stock's huge rise in share price, which has more than doubled this year and is up an astronomical 2,700% over the past five years.\nLet's take a closer close at the recent sales of Nvidia by executives and whether investors should follow suit.\nHuang's disposal of Nvidia shares last week continues a pattern of him selling the stock in recent months. Since June, Huang has sold 2.88 million shares of Nvidia while also gifting another 445,000 shares.\nThe sales are being done through what is known as a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which allows corporate insiders to sell company stock using predetermined trading instructions. The plans begin after a \"cooling off period\" and are generally set up to avoid any conflicts of interest and avoid insider trading issues.\nHuang initially set up the 10b5-1 plan in March and plans to sell 6 million shares (split adjusted) by the end of March 2025. However, with the CEO already selling nearly half of the 6 million shares tabbed to be sold, he is on pace to complete the trading plan in the next few months.\nWhile 6 million shares of Nvidia is a lot of stock, Huang still currently owns 864.1 million shares of Nvidia. As such, the stock sales are really just a drop in the bucket for the CEO.\nNow Huang isn't the only Nvidia insider who has been selling stock over the past two months. CFO Colette Kress, Principal Accounting Officer Donald Robertson Jr., EVP of Operations Debora Shoquist, EVP of Worldwide Field Operations Ajay Puri, and a few directors have also been selling shares. Most, however, continue to hold substantial positions in Nvidia stock.\nGiven the huge moves in the stock over the past few years, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Nvidia executives would want to cash in on some of their good fortune. It also isn't a bad portfolio management move to diversify some of their holding away from what very likely is their greatest source of wealth by far.\nThis is a bit more complicated question than it seems, as every individual's situation is different. For investors who have racked up huge gains in the stock, it could certainly be a prudent decision to trim positions and take some profits. Having one position be a large percentage of your portfolio, for example, increases risks, and at the end of the day, no one has a crystal ball into the future.\nThat said, Nvidia continues to look to have a long runway of growth with artificial intelligence (AI) still in its early days and companies continuing to look to build out data-center infrastructure to support AI applications. Nvidia's graphic processings units (GPUs) are used for both training large language models (LLMs) and AI inference, and demand for its newest chips continues to outstrip supply.\nWhile not the only GPU maker, the company has been able to create a wide moat through its Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software platform, which is the program whereby developers generally learn to program GPUs. This, combined with the company pushing the envelope on new chip architecture development to every year, should help keep Nvidia as the undisputed market leader in the build-out of AI infrastructure.\nMeanwhile, despite its strong performance over the past few years, the stock still trades at an attractive valuation. Based on 2025 analyst estimates, Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 32 times, while its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is under 0.7 times. Any number under 1 times is generally considered undervalued, especially for a growth stock.\nNow that doesn't mean that Nvidia is without risks. The largest risk to the stock is that GPU demand cools once the initial clamor for the hardware is met. If this happens and baseline demand turns out to be much lower than current demand, then the stock will tumble.\nThus, while I think Nvidia currently continues to look like an attractive buy based on its potential and valuation, it's still a smart move to take some profits on the way up and trim positions to keep them at appropriate levels.

        "Author": "  Anthony Lee ",
        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 8% in the afternoon session after the major indices fell with the Nasdaq down 1.2% while the S&P fell 0.6%. Investors are likely taking profits in megacap tech companies ahead of a big earnings week. Some of the big tech companies reporting earnings later in the week include Meta, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.\nAlso, investors may be positioning ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on July 31, 2024, for an update on the pace of rate cuts expected in the near term. The consensus estimate is for the Committee to start cutting rates as early as September 2024.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 16 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago, when the company dropped 5.6% as major indices declined, with the Nasdaq down 3%, while the S&P 500 fell by 1.7% following weaker-than-expected earnings from Alphabet (YouTube Advertising revenue missed estimates) and Tesla (7% drop in auto revenue). Tech giants, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Apple, have shed some of their year-to-date gains as a new market narrative\u2014in favor of small-caps stocks\u2014gains some momentum following the growing conviction that the Fed will start to cut rates in the second half of the year. The sentiment also benefitted from improved inflation prints last month, as the headline numbers edged closer to the Fed's 2% target. Overall, the shift suggests investors are finding more reasons to hold positions in risk assets, especially small caps that tend to be more volatile.\nNvidia is up 120% since the beginning of the year, but at $106.10 per share it is still trading 21.7% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $24,130.\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia Is Buying Shares of These 5 AI Companies. Should You Do the Same?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is one of the most closely watched companies in the world. It was once primarily known as a top supplier of gaming GPUs for PCs, but it subsequently evolved into the dominant producer of high-end data center GPUs.\nNvidia now generates most of its revenue from its data center GPUs, and demand for those chips is still outstripping supply as the artificial intelligence (AI) market expands. That's why its stock rallied more than 3,000% over the past five years, and why it's considered a linchpin and bellwether of the AI industry.\nNvidia could still have plenty of room to run as more companies launch AI applications, but the chipmaker has also been buying up shares of smaller AI companies. Let's look at five of those investments and see whether they could have a spot in your portfolio.\nIn a 13F filing earlier this year, Nvidia disclosed its investments in five companies as of Dec. 31, 2023: SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM), Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RXRX), Nano-X Imaging (NASDAQ: NNOX), and TuSimple Holdings. Here's how much Nvidia invested in each of those companies, and how much their shares have rallied or declined since that disclosure.\nCompany\nShares Bought\nMarket Value 12/31/2023\nMarket Value 7/6/2024\nGain (Loss)\nSoundHound AI\n1,730,883\n$3.67 million\n$7.25 million\n98%\nArm Holdings\n1,960,784\n$147.34 million\n$355.27 million\n141%\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals\n7,706,363\n$75.98 million\n$56.41 million\n(26%)\nNano-X Imaging\n59,632\n$0.38 million\n$0.41 million\n8%\nTuSimple Holdings*\n3,465,372\n$3.04 million\n$0.87 million\n(71%)\nData source: Nvidia. *TuSimple delisted itself from the Nasdaq and moved to the OTC market in January 2024.\nSoundHound AI and Arm generated much bigger gains than the other three stocks. SoundHound develops audio and speech recognition technologies, and its Houndify platform has been used to create customized voice tools for automakers like Hyundai, smart-TV makers like Vizio, and fast-food chains like Church's Chicken.\nArm designs power-efficient chips that are used in about 99% of the world's premium smartphones. Chipmakers like Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Apple all license Arm's designs for their own mobile chips. Nvidia also licenses Arm's designs for its Tegra CPUs, which are used in set-top boxes, Nintendo's Switch consoles, and automotive infotainment systems.\nNvidia has been bullish on both of these AI companies for a long time. It was one of SoundHound's earliest investors when it was still a start-up, and it nearly acquired Arm for $40 billion before antitrust regulators scuttled the deal in 2022.\nRecursion, Nano-X, and TuSimple are smaller and more speculative companies. Recursion uses AI algorithms to process drug discovery tests, Nano-X is a producer of digital X-ray sources and develops AI tools for identifying undetected chronic diseases, and TuSimple is a Chinese autonomous trucking company.\nOut of these five companies, only Arm is consistently profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. Therefore, it's easier to compare these five stocks using their estimated revenue growth and enterprise values.\nCompany\nRevenue (Last Fiscal Year)\nEnterprise Value\nEV/Revenue Ratio (Current Fiscal Year)\nEstimated CAGR (Next 2 Fiscal Years)\nSoundHound AI\n$45.9 million\n$1.3 billion\n20\n50%\nArm Holdings\n$3.2 billion\n$185.1 billion\n47\n23%\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals\n$44.6 million\n$1.6 billion\n27\n19%\nNano-X Imaging\n$9.9 million\n$395.3 million\n25\n130%\nTuSimple Holdings\n$0.3 million\n$60.9 million\n198\nN/A*\nData source: Marketscreener. *Due to delisting from Nasdaq. CAGR = compound annual growth rate.\nNone of these stocks look cheap right now, but SoundHound arguably looks like the most reasonably valued one relative to its growth potential. Arm runs a more stable business, but its valuation has been inflated by the buying frenzy in AI stocks.\nRecursion and Nano-X are developing promising technologies, but they haven't scaled up their businesses yet. As for TuSimple, the autonomous trucking company was caught in the crossfire of the escalating tech war between the U.S. and China, and it voluntarily delisted its shares from the Nasdaq earlier this year. That lack of visibility, along with its steep losses and sky-high valuation, make it a tough stock to recommend.\nThese five stocks are all tiny investments for Nvidia, which ended its latest quarter with $7.59 billion in cash and equivalents. The GPU giant won't lose much sleep if one of these companies goes under, but growth-oriented investors should stick with the two most established companies \u2014 namely, Arm and SoundHound \u2014 and simply keep an eye on the more speculative ones for now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Anirudha Bhagat ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has experienced an impressive 146.6% surge in its stock price year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry and The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK ETF\u2019s gains of 106.3% and 19.1%, respectively. This YTD performance makes the graphic processing unit (GPU) maker the third publicly traded U.S. company alongside Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL, which currently have a valuation of more than $3 trillion.\nWith a market capitalization of $3.414 trillion as of Jul 2, Microsoft is the most valuable company in the world. Apple holds the second spot with a market capitalization of $3.378 trillion, while NVIDIA is in the third position with a market capitalization of $3.058 trillion.\nAs a leading player in the semiconductor industry, NVIDIA has benefited from its dominance in GPUs and strategic expansion into artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and autonomous vehicles. Given this remarkable growth, the question arises whether it is too late to buy into NVIDIA or if there is still room for further appreciation.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA's remarkable stock performance has been primarily driven by the anticipation that the company will reap substantial benefits from the growing investments in generative AI. Given NVIDIA's leading position in this space and the vast opportunities generative AI presents, the stock seems poised to maintain its upward trajectory throughout the year.\nThe increasing demand for workflow modernization across various industries is expected to elevate the need for generative AI applications. According to a recent report by Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is projected to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.\nHowever, generative AI requires extensive expertise for content creation and significant computational power. As a result, enterprises developing generative AI-based applications will need to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\nNVIDIA's next-generation chips, renowned for their high computing power, are likely to become the preferred choice for enterprises. The company\u2019s GPUs are already widely used in AI models, which is expanding NVIDIA\u2019s presence in emerging markets such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\nThe generative AI revolution is expected to drive substantial demand for NVIDIA's next-generation, high-computing power chips. With the increasing AI investments in the data center sector, NVIDIA anticipates its second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues to reach $28 billion from $13.51 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nNVIDIA's strong product portfolio, leadership in AI and relentless innovation present a compelling investment opportunity. Moreover, the shares of NVIDIA are trading above the 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe company enjoys high market esteem, and savvy investors should consider leveraging NVDA\u2019s potential for sustained long-term growth. NVIDIA boasts an impressive long-term expected earnings growth rate of 37.6%, significantly outpacing the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s growth rate of 18.9%. This semiconductor company\u2019s earnings have consistently exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 24%.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $117.55 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of approximately 93%. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by a penny to $2.53 per share over the past seven days, which calls for year-over-year growth of 113.4%.\nFinancially, NVIDIA is on solid ground, with ample cash reserves that provide a cushion against market volatility. As of Apr 28, 2024, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $31.44 billion, up from $25.98 billion on Jan 28, 2024.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s stock trades at a one-year forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23.01, which is higher than the Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s forward P/S multiple of 19.2. While this might be perceived as a risk, the premium is justified due to NVIDIA's consistent financial performance and substantial growth prospects in emerging sectors such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAdditionally, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and currently boasts a Growth Score of A, making it a highly attractive investment option, according to Zacks' proprietary methodology.

        "Author": "  Maleha Afzal ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stories.\nChina and the United States continue to compete against each other as the AI boom continues to reign in the tech industry. On July 2, Reuters reported that China plans to develop 50 new national and industrial standards for artificial intelligence by 2026. The country aims to standardize systems in the artificial intelligence sector by providing thorough guidelines to companies and budding startups. Furthermore, on July 3, Reuters reported that China filed six times more patents than the United States for inventions in AI like chatbots. On a global scale, more than 50,000 patent applications were filed in the past decade, a quarter of which were filed in 2023 alone. China filed 38,000 generative AI applications between 2014 and 2023, while the United States only filed slightly over 6,200 applications during the same period. Of the total applications, ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft filed the largest number of applications. The report added that Chinese patent applications covered a wider range of sectors such as autonomous driving, publishing, and document management. South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.\nThe United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.\nWhile the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.\nOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.\nIn another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.\nAnthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.\nClaude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.\nA lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 186\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most popular AI stories at the moment. The company is pioneering AI software and hardware products. The company's Advanced AI platform for Enterprise improves productivity, streamlines AI workflows, and ensures faster deployment and processing of AI. Earlier this year, the company introduced its Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU), backed by six different technologies in data processing, design automation, drug design, quantum computing, and generative AI.\nOverall, the company logged $22.6 billion in data center revenue, up 23% from the previous quarter and 427% year-over-year. The revenue growth was driven by strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU Computing platform. Compute revenue grew by 5x and networking revenue expanded by 3x compared to the previous year. The Hopper GPU is one of the world's first accelerated computing platforms, built with over 80 billion transistors. Nvidia's advancements in AI are accelerating at a rapid pace. On June 19, the company launched the NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX, a set of microservices that enable the development of autonomous machines using AI.\nMoor Insights & Strategy Founder, CEO, and Chief Analyst Patrick Moorhead, recently talked about NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in an interview on Yahoo Finance. He positions Nvidia as the primary provider of AI infrastructure systems. He compares Nvidia's position to Cisco, the driver of infrastructure from the internet age in the early 2000s. Moorhead highlights that the company's dominant position is backed by sustained enterprise demand, and he sees nothing changing in the next six to nine months. However, he suggests that to maintain its dominance, Nvidia needs to emphasize growth in enterprise.\nAt the close of Q1 2024, 186 investors were bullish on NVDA, with total stakes amounting to $48.3 billion. Of those, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the highest stakeholder with a position of $18.74 billion.\nOn July 1, Morgan Stanley maintained an overweight rating on the stock and raised its price target from $116 to $144.\nHere are some comments about Nvidia from the Meridian Funds Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system-on-a-chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. The company has experienced strong performance recently due to booming demand for its data center products, particularly those related to artificial intelligence. A major driver of Nvidia\u2019s recent success has been the growing adoption of its GPU accelerators for AI training and inference across various end markets. The company\u2019s GPUs have become an industry standard for training large language models (LLMs), and its networking solutions, such as NVLink and InfiniBand, are critical to maximizing the performance of AI systems. Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell GPU platform is expected to further extend its lead in the AI accelerator market, with significant performance and total cost of ownership benefits over its predecessors. As the AI market continues to expand with growing adoption across enterprises and sovereign nations, we expect Nvidia to maintain its dominance and experience sustained growth in its data center business. Beyond data centers, Nvidia has also benefited from strong demand in its gaming business, which has recovered after a period of inventory digestion in 2022. The company\u2019s gaming GPUs have been well-received, and its focus on the high-end market has supported growth in average selling prices. Looking ahead, we expect the gaming market to remain healthy with ongoing growth potential. Nvidia also sees opportunities to diversify its business and foray into new markets, such as automotive and robotics.

The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price was up 4.1% as of 1:30 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nNvidia stock is gaining ground today thanks to news that it's developing a new, high-performance AI processor for the Chinese market. The stock is also getting a boost thanks to bullish coverage from analysts.\nReuters published a report this morning suggesting that Nvidia is designing a new offshoot variant of its most powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) for the Chinese market. Shipments of the B20 chip and related processor technology are expected to begin in China in the second quarter of 2025.\nConcerns about Nvidia's ability to sell advanced processors in the country due to restrictions enacted by the U.S. and other allies have been dragging on the company's stock recently. In addition to potentially creating a sizable short-term revenue stream, the move also signals that Nvidia does not appear to pivoting from China -- one of the largest markets for its hardware and services.\nIn a note published this morning, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar raised his one-year price target on Nvidia stock from $120 per share to $140 per share. The firm's lead analyst on the company cited favorable business trends and the launch of the AI leader's new Blackwell chip platform in October as catalysts for the increase. The first Blackwell processors are expected to deliver major leaps in performance over Nvidia's current high-end chips, which are already best-in-class.\nLoop Capital also published a bullish note on Nvidia stock, reiterating its buy rating and raising its one-year price target from $120 per share to $175 per share. Analyst Ananda Baruah thinks the company could be on track to deliver revenue from its data center segment that far exceeds Wall Street's expectations. Baruah thinks that data center revenue for 2025 could come in between $215 billion and $240 billion, while the average analyst estimate calls for sales of $145 billion. The analyst also thinks that sales for the compute segment could hit between $200 billion and $225 billion, ahead of Wall Street's target for sales of $132 billion.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Shares fell 1.9% on Friday, compared with a gain of 1% for the Nasdaq 100 Index.\nAdditional upside \u201cwill only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet,\u201d Ferragu wrote.\nWhile the \u201cquality of the franchise is nevertheless intact,\u201d there is, \u201cif anything, a risk of derating\u201d should the current outlook remain unchanged, he added.\nNvidia is the second-best performer among S&P 500 components this year, behind Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI), another favorite among AI investors. The climb has added almost $1.9 trillion to Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization, and briefly resulted in it attaining the title of the world\u2019s largest company.\nAnalyst downgrades are rare for a company that has become the biggest beneficiary of the artificial intelligence spending boom. Nearly 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock. However, valuation is often cited as a concern. Nvidia trades at more than 22 times estimated revenue for the next 12 months, making it the most expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index by this measure.\nNew Street set a one-year price target of $135 for Nvidia, compared with its Friday close of $125.82.\nBeyond Nvidia, New Street is positive on both Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

        "Text": "Chip stocks Nvidia (NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), and ASML (ASML) have all soared this year thanks to investor bets on the artificial intelligence boom. On Wednesday, their momentum came to a screeching halt.\nThe three stocks slid for reasons ranging from investor concern over export restrictions to a broader rotation out of tech stocks.\nOne headwind that emerged was the potential for tighter restrictions on exports of semiconductor technology to China.\nBloomberg reported the Biden administration is considering implementing a more severe curb involving controls on foreign-manufactured products that use even the smallest amount of American technology.\nCurrent restrictions have already impacted US-based companies\u2019 ability to sell to China. Nvidia sales to China decreased as a percentage of total data center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024.\nASML stock saw the steepest decline on Wednesday, falling more than 12%. Shares of the Netherlands-based chip equipment maker were also pressured following its third quarter guidance.\nWhile ASML beat its second quarter top- and bottom-line expectations, its revenue forecast for the current quarter came in shy of the consensus analyst estimate.\nThe company also said it expects quarterly gross margin in the range of 50% to 51% versus Wall Street expectations of 51.1%.\nAlso dragging down chip stocks were comments from former president Donald Trump, who said Taiwan \"should pay\" the US for protection against any aggression from China.\n\u201cYou know, we\u2019re no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn\u2019t give us anything,\u201d Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek in an interview published on Tuesday.\nHe also said Taiwan took \"about 100%\" of the US chip business.\nTrump's comments sent shares of chip manufacturing and design giant TSMC plummeting more than 7% on Wednesday.\nMany chipmakers, including Nvidia, depend on Taiwan for manufacturing. The island located east of China is a major semiconductor hub with roughly 92% of the world\u2019s most advanced chipmaking capacity, according to the US International Trade Commission.\nIt's worth noting shares of semiconductor companies Intel (INTC) and GlobalFoundries (GFS) were up during the session. Both companies are seen beneficiaries of the Biden administration's push to onshore chip production to the US.\nThe semis sell-off comes as investors have recently rotated out of big-cap names into small-cap stocks.\nThe rotation out technology began last week after the latest inflation print gave investors more optimism that the Federal Reserve would start cutting rates in September.\nThe Russell 2000 (^RUT) outperformed large-cap stocks on the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) over a five-session streak.\nOn Wednesday the small-cap index fell roughly 1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped almost 3%.\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) share prices have recently reversed course after seemingly pushing higher for months without a breather. The stock now trades nearly 13% off its intraday high price of over $140 per share hit last month.\nThere is one Wall Street analyst who thinks shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) leader will soon rebound and even exceed its all-time high. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore put out a new note on Nvidia on Monday increasing his price target from $116 to $144 per share. Moore determined that share price based on what he sees as a jump in earnings per share (EPS) through next year. Moore thinks Nvidia stock is worth buying as his new price target would represent a gain of about 17.5% from its current price.\nAfter data checks pointed to strong demand in China and Taiwan, as well as the U.S., Moore raised his EPS estimate for the semiconductor giant from $2.94 to $3.34 per share for next year. Moore believes Nvidia, \"remains the most compelling narrative in the AI [semiconductor] space, and as we transition from H100 to H200 and then Blackwell, visibility and backlog will improve materially.\"\nThat last point is the key to an investment in Nvidia right now. Even after its recent correction, Nvidia shares had run up ahead of revenue and earnings growth. In other words, further growth is already built into the stock price to some extent.\nBut even as Nvidia prepares to begin bulk shipments of its new, Blackwell AI platform, its H100 and H200 graphics processing units (GPUs) are still in high demand. That's because many of Nvidia's customers have been waiting in line to get these high-strength computing chips needed for training generative AI models.\nThose sales will remain strong even as shipments of the new Blackwell chip accelerate. That's why investors should still feel comfortable buying Nvidia shares. Even after the massive gains, there is a strong base of sales, and an even stronger pipeline of new AI products ahead.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nThe U.S. is considering new trade restrictions that could prevent Nvidia from selling its China-oriented\u00a0HGX-H20\u00a0AI GPU, according to a Jefferies note to clients, reports\u00a0QZ. This is part of the U.S. government's plan to restrict China's access to advanced AI technology, and if implemented, it could cost Nvidia an estimated\u00a0$12 billion\u00a0in revenue.\nNvidia's new HGX H20 GPUs are designed to comply with U.S. export rules while still offering strong AI performance. They provide up to 296 INT8 TOPS/FP8 TFLOPS, 96 GB of HBM3 memory, and 4.0 TB/s memory bandwidth, making them competitive against entry-level AI processors. Despite appearing less potent on paper, the HGX H20 outperforms its direct competitor, Huawei's Ascend 920-series AI processors, in practical applications due to better memory performance. It is what concerns U.S. lawmakers.\nNvidia's H20 product may face a sales ban when the U.S. reviews its semiconductor export policies in October, reports QZ based on a Jefferies report. This ban could take several forms, including a product-specific prohibition, a reduction in a chip's computing power, or a limit on its memory capacity.\nMost Chinese AI companies have developed their application ecosystems on Nvidia's CUDA platform, so transitioning to others (e.g., Huawei Ascend) would be expensive and time-consuming. Given that the HGX H20 GPU is fully compatible with Nvidia's CUDA platform, it is the preferred choice for many companies and applications despite being significantly slower than the full-featured\u00a0H100.\nIt is noteworthy that despite existing export controls, Chinese companies have obtained advanced Nvidia GPUs for AI and HPC through\u00a0intermediaries and by renting servers from companies like Google and Microsoft inappropriate cloud services.\nThe U.S. may also extend export restrictions to other Asian countries, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and potentially overseas Chinese companies. However, the report says enforcing these extended controls would be complex and challenging to implement effectively.\nEnforcing (or denying) access to Chinese entities from the cloud might be problematic. Given the vast processing performance requirements for AI large-language training, it is almost inevitable that Chinese entities will access GPU performance one way or another, which means they would simply rent instances in the cloud.\n"

I am neutral on the outlook for Nvidia stock, as I believe the current valuation reflects the economic reality facing the company.\nNvidia still has the backing of analysts who believe in its innovation and market competitiveness. For example, Morgan Stanley (MS) recently upgraded its rating on Nvidia and set a price target of $144, citing their confidence in the company\u2019s ability to stay at the top of the AI chip industry.\nBlackwell chips, which are faster and more versatile compared to existing AI chips, are expected to attract strong demand from big tech companies, such as Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), as these companies accelerate their AI investments.\nEach Blackwell chip is expected to be priced between $35,000 and $50,000, contributing positively to Nvidia\u2019s profit margins, given that H100 and H200 chips \u2013 Nvidia\u2019s best-selling products today \u2013 are priced between $25,000 to $40,000.\nEdward Jones analysts also pointed out recently that Nvidia\u2019s massive share in the AI chip market and its comfortable lead in the GPU market highlight the company\u2019s competitive advantages.\nNvidia has successfully transitioned from a gaming-oriented chip developer to one focused on data centers. This new focus has allowed the company to expand its horizons and cater to the growing demand for data center GPUs. The CUDA platform \u2013 an AI development standard across various domains that allows developers to optimize processor performance while easily creating robust AI applications \u2013 has also been a growth driver in recent times and is expected to contribute positively to Nvidia\u2019s growth in the future.\nAccording to many Wall Street analysts, Nvidia\u2019s ability to continue to attract and retain engineering talent is also a key differentiator, as it positions the company to be at the forefront of innovation.\nThough analysts are generally positive about Nvidia stock, some are questioning the sustainability of earnings growth as well as current valuation levels. For instance, New Street Research recently downgraded Nvidia due to its extended valuation. New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu believes there will be limited upside from here unless Nvidia boosts the outlook beyond 2025 meaningfully, which is not likely to happen anytime soon.\nNvidia is currently valued at a forward P/E of 47x, which does not scream overvaluation, but this may change if growth decelerates in the foreseeable future.\nDA Davidson analyst Gil Luria is bearish on Nvidia, as he believes the demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs will decline in the next 18 months as tech giants such as Amazon and Meta Platforms (META) are likely to develop their own chips. Barclays (BCS) analyst Blayne Curtis also noted recently that Nvidia\u2019s long-term outlook is not as rosy as it seems, given that some of its biggest customers are already looking for a solution to reduce their dependency on Nvidia chips.\nNvidia is enjoying competitive advantages, evident from its industry-leading gross margin and leading market share. According to Mizuho Securities, Nvidia controls between 70% and 95% of the market for AI chips, which gives the company pricing power. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia\u2019s gross margins came to 78% compared to just 41% for Intel (INTC) and 51% for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\nThese competitive advantages will help Nvidia report strong earnings growth in the next few quarters, but some risks are looming on the horizon. Last November, at the DealBook Summit, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang admitted that he wakes up every morning in fear that the company will fail due to increasing competition.\nAMD, with its Radeon Instinct GPUs, is trying to capture a share of the growing data center market, and the company\u2019s acquisition of Xilinx in 2022 has helped it gain traction in the AI and machine learning field. Intel is also making inroads into the data center market with its Habana Gaudi AI processors, which are designed to compete with Nvidia\u2019s data center GPUs.\nThe biggest threat to Nvidia\u2019s AI dominance comes from big tech giants who are focused on reducing their reliance on Nvidia\u2019s products.\nGoogle, wanting to be self-sufficient when it comes to sourcing advanced AI chips, has developed an in-house AI chip series called Tensor Processing Units. These chips are already used in Google\u2019s data centers. Amazon has also developed its own AI chips called Inferentia and Trainium, targeting AWS customers who use Nvidia GPUs for AI applications. In addition to these tech giants, Microsoft and Meta have also announced investments in their own AI chips.\nBased on the ratings of 41 Wall Street analysts, NVDA stock comes in as a Strong Buy, with 37 Buy ratings and four Holds. The average Nvidia stock price target is $140.85, which implies upside potential of 11.5% from the current market price.\nNvidia is enjoying competitive advantages, which justifies the premium valuation it trades at. However, competition in the AI chip market is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years, with rival chipmakers and big tech companies aggressively investing in AI chips to grab a share of this booming market. Because of this looming threat, Nvidia seems fairly valued today, with no margin of safety to attract new investors at the current stock price.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock fell again in Tuesday's trading. The artificial intelligence (AI) frontrunner's share price ended the daily session down 7%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nNvidia's pullback in today's trading appears to be a classic case of a \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" dynamic. Yesterday, CEO Jensen Huang participated in two fireside chats at the SIGGRAPH 2024 conference \u2014 and some investors had set their expectations very high. A report suggesting that Apple had used chips designed by Alphabet to train AI models was also a factor in the sell-off. Nvidia stock is now down roughly 24% from the lifetime high that it hit on June 18.\nWhile CEO Jensen Huang provided some interesting commentary and projections about AI assistants and other opportunities yesterday, investors were expecting more. Nvidia did announce new AI models, support services for robotics technologies, and an acceleration of its own humanoid robot development in conjunction with Huang's events at the SIGGRAPH conference. But that still wasn't enough to move the stock in a bullish direction.\nAdding another bearish catalyst, Reuters reported today that Apple had used Alphabet's chips to train two of its AI models. Thus far, Nvidia has had a clear edge when it comes to advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence applications \u2014 and this strength has been the driving force in the stock's incredible rise.\nIf Alphabet and other big tech companies can deliver tech that rivals Nvidia's for AI training, the semiconductor specialist could be in trouble. On the other hand, it's not clear that the company's dominance in the high-end GPU space is actually being threatened \u2014 and the recent pullback could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors.\nAfter recent sell-offs, Nvidia is now trading at roughly 38 times this year's expected earnings and 21 times expected sales. The company has already been posting stellar sales growth and margins, and it looks like the excellent expansion momentum and profits are poised to continue in the near term.\nWith its last guidance update, Nvidia estimated that sales would increase 107% year over year to reach $28 billion in the second quarter and a 74.8% gross margin. There's a very good chance that the AI leader will blow past its growth target when it reports earnings at the end of August, and sales growth could accelerate again soon after. The company's next-generation Blackwell processor platform is scheduled to debut in this year's Q4 and is poised to be another powerful performance driver.\nGiven the incredible expectations surrounding Nvidia, it's not shocking that the stock has seen high levels of volatility lately. But the company's valuation actually looks reasonable in the context of its recent momentum and near-term growth trajectory, and there's a good chance that the chip specialist will continue to see powerful, long-term tailwinds from the rise of AI.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Noel Randewich\n(Reuters) -Nvidia added about $330 billion in stock market value on Wednesday, a record one-day gain for any company on Wall Street after Microsoft and Advanced Micro Devices reignited the AI rally.\nNvidia surged nearly 13% on expectations its top-of-the-line processors will remain in tight demand after Microsoft late on Tuesday reported a massive increase in artificial intelligence expenditures.\nAlso lifting Nvidia and other chipmakers, Advanced Micro Devices ratcheted up its 2024 forecast for its AI chip sales. Microsoft fell 1.1%.\n\"Microsoft reported some deceleration in its core cloud business, but a huge increase in capex. That represents a transfer of wealth from Microsoft shareholders to Nvidia shareholders,\" said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson.\nNvidia's surge in stock market value shattered Wall Street's previous record, which Nvidia also set on Feb. 22 with a $277 billion gain.\nNvidia is now valued at $2.88 trillion, making it Wall Street's third most valuable company, behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia's highest ever closing stock market value was $3.34 trillion on June 18, according to LSEG.\nThe PHLX chip index surged 7% in its biggest one-day gain since 2022. The index sold off for much of July over worries that a rally fueled by optimism about AI had become overextended. It remains down 11% from its record high close on July 10.\nIn its report, Microsoft said revenue from its Intelligent Cloud unit - home to the Azure cloud-computing platform - jumped 19% to $28.5 billion, but missed analysts' estimates of $28.7 billion.\n\"Since Microsoft makes up approximately 20% of demand for Nvidia's highest quality AI chips, increasing capex spend at Microsoft is good news for Nvidia's bottom line,\" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.\n\"Since Nvidia remains the leading hardware producer for AI technology, increasing capex spend by its biggest customers bodes well for Nvidia's results.\"\nIts capital expenditure, including finance leases, surged 78% in the quarter to $19 billion, with Microsoft saying it needs to expand its global network of data centers and overcome capacity constraints to meet AI demand.\nThe growing cost of the AI race shook investor confidence after Alphabet last week reported a bigger-than-expected rise in capital expenditure to support its generative AI technology.\nTechnology companies have faced high expectations going into this earnings season. Analysts on average see technology companies in the S&P 500 growing their aggregated earnings by almost 10%, according to LSEG data.\nAMD surged more than 4% after it forecast third-quarter revenue above market estimates on Tuesday, banking on demand for its AI chips staying strong.\nBroadcom, which also sells AI-related chips rallied 12%.\n\"We're still in a tough macro environment. AI is absolutely real, but requires a lot of investment and that is visible in the capex numbers,\" said Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Anna Tong in San Francisco and Aditya Soni, Yuvraj Malik, Kanchana Chakravarty and Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by David Gregorio, Arun Koyyur and Marguerita Choy)\n"

        "Title": "AMD Might Not Beat Nvidia, but Here's Why It's Still a Long-Term Buy",
        "Author": "  John Kinsellagh, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "With a 90% market share, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) reigns as the undisputed King of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) chip market. Yet, in an ironic twist, the company's very success has created favorable conditions for its rivals to take down the AI titan a notch or two from atop its perch. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) realizes the opportunity a supply-constrained Nvidia has presented and intends to fully exploit these fortuitous circumstances to its advantage.\nNvidia's unprecedented revenue growth, its rising stock price and consequential market capitalization have all demonstrated that the AI infrastructure market is sustainable and unbounded. Hyper-demand for Nvidia's chips has dispelled any lingering doubts that AI mania is merely another dot.com bubble waiting to burst.\nGraphics Processing Unit (GPU)chips are the lifeblood of generative AI systems. Semiconductor companies, such as AMD, provide the essential chip architecture capabilities necessary to create and sustain such systems. Tech companies that build or design these indispensable components are the only businesses at present able to convert the AI hype into an appreciable revenue reality.\nHardware companies such as Dell and Lenovo, as well as cloud providers, need AI chips immediately at competitive prices to meet rising customer demand. They can't secure chips from Nvidia fast enough, which means buying GPU hardware from other sources.\nRealizing the profit potential presented by this current supply and demand imbalance, AMD has stepped into this supply void swiftly. It has seized this opportunity by quickly ramping up production of its AI GPU series 1300 processors as an alternative to Nvidia's offerings for a tech sector hungry for data center chips.\nLike other semiconductor companies, over the past two years, AMD has suffered from a chip glut that is only now starting to dissipate as tech companies wind down their excess inventories. Poor performance in the company's two non-data center segments resulted in tepid overall revenue growth of 2% year-over-year.The company's gaming segment was down 48% year-over-year; its embedded segment, which provides processing needs for the industrial, automotive and testing industries, fell 46% year-over-year.\nThe more telling metric for ascertaining the company's prospects, however, is the astounding growth in the company's data center business. Revenues from this segment grew an astounding 80% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. The client segment, which provides CPUs for servers, laptops, mobile and desktop devices, surged 85% to $1.4 billion.\nAccelerated growth from the data center and client segments prompted the company to raise its full-year 2024 guidance from $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion. CEO Lisa Su stated that based on customer engagements, these estimates are realistic.\nOver time, earnings from AMD's cloud GPU sales will far surpass that of the two non-data center segments that have dragged down overall revenue.\nGiven its flat year-over-year revenue growth, at 46 times the next twelve months' earnings, AMD's current valuation appears to be stretched. At 47 for the same multiple, Nvidia barely beats AMD by this same metric, even though its recent growth rate has been much greater.\nSince it's categorized as a semiconductor stock, AMD's current valuation, however, doesn't fully reflect its long-term revenue potential. For a company just entering the AI GPU business, AMD's data center growth was off the charts. The market will continue to respond favorably to AMD's offerings because cloud providers welcome the competition. Many don't want to be locked into Nvidia's ecosystem.\nBy some estimates, the AI market could grow to $403 billion by 2027 and $1 trillion by 2030. These projections demonstrate the extent to which AMD can benefit from AI's long-term revenue potential.\nCloud providers want competitive chip pricing which opens a wide door for AMD and others to carve into Nvidia's market share. With its focused AI data center strategy, over time, AMD's valuation as an AI stock will grow, as the company's increasing earnings reveal that its long-term AI growth potential is sustainable.\nInvestors shouldn't expect any short-term gains from the stock. Purchasing AMD is suitable only for those with a long-term investment horizon.\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Christiaan Hetzner ",
        "Text": "Nvidia H100 chips are still the hottest commodity in the tech industry, but sadly the same cannot necessarily be said about its stock.\nShares in Jensen Huang\u2019s semiconductor company have plunged 20% since their all-time closing high on June 18, usually considered to be the start of a bear market. Already roughly more than $780 billion have been wiped off its market cap, an amount equivalent to the entire value of Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla or an Eli Lilly, the pharma group behind GLP-1 weight-loss drug Zepbound.\nWhile the stock saw a relief rally, yo-yoing sharply higher on Wednesday, it only snapped back to last week\u2019s levels, and the gains could prove short-lived as sentiment across the sector remains fragile.\nThe Futurum Group, a research and advisory firm for the tech industry, told the Financial Times the weakness was likely just a rotation out of sectors that performed well over the course of the year as opposed to anything related to its underlying fundamentals.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen money flow out of Big Tech mostly, I think, because they have had an incredible run-up,\u201d CEO Daniel Newman said, \u201cand that, of course, gave room for a little bit of a selloff.\u201d\nNvidia sells graphic processors best suited for training neural networks like transformers used in the development of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and other large language models. Its most advanced chips are so powerful the U.S. imposes export controls to ensure they do not fall into the hands of strategic rivals like China.\nConcerns have grown in recent weeks, however, that major cloud-computing providers\u2014including hyperscalers Amazon, Microsoft and Google\u2014as well as other megacap companies investing heavily in AI, such as Meta and Tesla, may not see a sufficient return on their investments.\nMicrosoft predicted revenue growth in its Azure cloud business would\u00a0slow\u00a0in the current first quarter from the 29% achieved in the three months through June, before accelerating in the second half of its fiscal year. Shares took a beating on Wednesday, heavily underperforming gains in the S&P 500 index.\nAnother major customer of Nvidia\u2019s to disappoint recently was Tesla, which needs AI training chips to solve autonomous driving\u2014something CEO Elon Musk promised he would finally crack this year or next. (He\u2019d previously promised Tesla cars could drive cross-country, on their own, by the end of 2017.) So far this year he\u2019s spent $1.6 billion to bulk up his computing cluster, which trains on images fed from cameras mounted on all Tesla cars.\nOn an investor call last week, Musk said the lack of a constant and reliable supply of Nvidia H100 chips is forcing him to double down now on Dojo, his own proprietary silicon optimized for vision-based machine learning. Musk has talked about renting out spare training compute to third parties, a \u201cDojo-as-a-service\u201d that Morgan Stanley estimates can be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. If successful, his custom silicon would pose a threat to Nvidia.\nEven after the drop, Nvidia has still more than doubled its value since the start of January. But it\u2019s a far cry from the heady days of this spring when it eclipsed Apple and Microsoft to become the largest company in the world, at one point worth over $3.3 trillion.\nThe weakness has also affected its Taiwan production partner, TSMC, the world\u2019s largest foundry for fabricating microchips outsourced by third parties like Nvidia. Its stock has lost\u00a0roughly $200 billion\u00a0over the past couple of weeks after breaking through\u00a0the $1 trillion mark\u00a0at one point. It, too, is experiencing a relief rally.\n\u201cNvidia stock has become a wasteland,\u201d said investor Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money, on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s because Nvidia doesn\u2019t benefit from rate cuts, so its stock gets kicked to the curb in this environment.\u201d\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune.\nLater on Wednesday the Federal Reserve is\u00a0expected\u00a0to lay the groundwork for a rate cut in\u00a0September, its first since March 2020.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "In a recent development, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is making significant strides in the AI stock market, posing a challenge to Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nWhat Happened: The report, based on recent interactions with investors in New York and Connecticut, indicates that Broadcom\u2019s specialized AI business is gaining traction, Business Insider reported on Tuesday. The company has been assisting cloud giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in developing customized AI chips for internal use.\nDon't Miss:\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in a house-printing startup who\u2019s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry.\n\u201cAVGO is catching up to NVDA as the top holding as AVGO has more AI customers joining (OpenAI and Bytedance) and accretion from VMware,\u201d Citi noted. However, Broadcom\u2019s stock still lags behind Nvidia\u2019s, with a 79% gain in a year compared to Nvidia\u2019s 177%.\nThe shift in investor sentiment towards Broadcom is significant, given Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the AI stock market. Other semiconductor companies, including NXP Semiconductors and Advanced Analog Devices, are also seeing increased investor interest due to expected inventory replenishments.\nSee Also: General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share.\nDespite a mixed sentiment, Citi maintains a positive outlook on the semiconductor sector, stating, \u201cWe remain wildly bullish on semis.\u201d\nWhy It Matters: Broadcom is targeting a massive artificial intelligence (AI) silicon market opportunity, worth over $150 billion in the next five years. This positions the tech giant for significant growth, both in the near term and long term.\nBroadcom\u2019s dominance in the $5-7 billion data center/AI Ethernet switching and routing chipset market, with a commanding 80% market share. This dominance is largely due to its relentless innovation.\nDespite Broadcom\u2019s progress, Nvidia could achieve a market capitalization of nearly $50 trillion within the next decade, according to tech investor James Anderson.\nPrice Action: On Tuesday, Broadcom was trading 0.11% lower in the pre-market after closing at $161.06 on Monday, according to Benzinga Pro.\nRead Next:\nRory McIlroy\u2019s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 \u2014 here\u2019s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100\nGen Z and Millennial millionaires couldn't care less for stocks and bonds \u2014 Here's what they're buying instead.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article Broadcom To Challenge Nvidia Dominance?

        "Author": "  Nick Turner and Samuel Stolton ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- French antitrust enforcers are preparing to charge Nvidia Corp. with allegedly anticompetitive practices, Reuters reported, as the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker faces mounting regulatory scrutiny.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nKamala Harris Is Having a Surprise Resurgence as Biden\u2019s Campaign Unravels\nSingapore Couples Are Marrying Earlier to Buy Homes, Leading Some to Regret\nSingapore Is Making Life Tougher for Global Talent\nStocks Up as Jobs Spur Calls for September Fed Cut: Markets Wrap\nBiden\u2019s Fourth of July Shrouded by Pressure to Drop 2024 Bid\nThe French agency would be the world\u2019s first to take such a step, Reuters said, citing unidentified people with direct knowledge of the matter. The charge sheet \u2014 or statement of objections \u2014 would follow a raid of Nvidia offices last year.\nNvidia has drawn the attention of regulators since becoming the biggest beneficiary of the artificial intelligence spending boom. Its chips \u2014 known as graphics processing units, or GPUs \u2014 are prized by data center operators for their ability to crunch the massive amount of information required to develop AI models.\nThe French antitrust agency declined to comment to Bloomberg, as did Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia.\nNvidia shares slipped as much as 3.8% on Monday in New York before mostly recovering. They have more than doubled this year, pushing the company\u2019s valuation above $3 trillion.\nIn September, French antitrust enforcers raided the offices of a business suspected of engaging in \u201canticompetitive practices in the graphics cards sector.\u201d They didn\u2019t identify the company as Nvidia at the time, but the chipmaker has since acknowledged that France and other entities are examining its business practices.\nOfficials in the US, European Union, China and the UK are also scrutinizing its operations, Nvidia said in a filing in February.\n\u201cOur position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide,\u201d the chipmaker said at the time.\nFrench antitrust watchdogs have been interviewing market players on Nvidia\u2019s key role in AI processors, its pricing policy, the shortage of chips and the impact on prices. The office raid was aimed at gleaning more information on potential abuses of dominance.\nFines for breaching France\u2019s antitrust law can be as high as 10% of a company\u2019s global annual revenue. The agency lists a \u20ac1.24 billion ($1.33 billion) fine from 2020 as its largest since 2011. Of that, \u20ac1.1 billion was imposed on Apple Inc., while the rest was levied against two distributors.\nIn Brussels, the European Commission has been informally gathering views on whether Nvidia may have also run afoul of its own antitrust rules, but it has yet to launch a formal probe into anticompetitive conduct.\nIn November, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that Nvidia\u2019s dominance was causing \u201cgrowing inequalities\u201d between countries and stifling fair competition. He said that 92% of GPUs are from Nvidia.\n\u201cIf you want to have fair competition, you need to have many private companies and not one single company having the possibility of selling all the devices,\u201d Le Maire said.\n--With assistance from Mackenzie Hawkins and Alan Katz.\n(Updates with more on raid starting in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing\nFor Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate\nThe Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before\nOnline Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Ethan Gach ",
        "Text": "Nvidia started as a humble graphics card maker. Now it\u2019s riding the tech industry\u2019s AI obsession to absurd new heights. The company added $329 billion to its market cap on Wall Street today after a record-breaking day of stock trading, Bloomberg reports.\nMost people know Nvidia as the manufacturer of the chip that powers their Android phones, Nintendo Switches, and top-end PC gaming rigs. It got its first big break designing the GPU for Microsoft\u2019s original Xbox, and helped Sony design the graphics processor for the PlayStation 3. For years it was the company that held up big hunks metal with plastic fans on stage to woo gamers with upgrades they couldn\u2019t afford. Now it\u2019s quickly become something else entirely.\nNvidia was trading below $15 a share at the start of 2023. Less than two years later it\u2019s over $100. What changed? Microsoft and others are gobbling up GPUs to power their AI ambitions. It seemed like the fever might have broken amid a renewed wave of skepticism around what generative AI and machine learning will actually be useful for, but then Microsoft announced it\u2019s going to continue pouring billions into server farms for AI computing and Nvidia\u2019s stock shot up more than most companies are worth in less than eight hours. Let\u2019s remember some previous high scores:\n$329 billion is more than Netflix, Coca-Cola, and Bank of America. It\u2019s the value of eight Electronic Arts and 12 Take-Twos, whose subsidiary Rockstar Games publishes Grand Theft Auto VI next year. Nvidia isn\u2019t worth more than ever\u2014it peaked last month at over $3 trillion\u2014but this single-day swing points to how completely untethered the company has become from its recent history or the current marketplace reality in which OpenAI is reportedly losing billions. With Meta pivoting from VR to the AI chip arms race and others chasing desperately to catch up, Nvidia has quickly become the center of the tech and financial universe.\n\u2018These violent delights have violent ends.\u201d We might just be witnessing the first of many transformations before Nvidia\u2019s final form. Maybe it will be the first true megacorp in a future cyberpunk dystopia, or maybe some of the plates stop spinning and start breaking and the company goes back to releasing hard-to-find Gundam-branded graphics cards for $4,000 gaming rigs that let you play Ghost of Tsushima in 4K at 120fps. It\u2019s never a good sign when the numbers get so insane that they stop meaning anything.\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n"

I actually posted his final 5-paragraph \"mic drop\" because it captured the essence of the technological transformation we are in for science, industry, medicine, education, and society.Jensen & Co. systems have \"the transition\" covered with TCO (total cost of operations) fully seamless -- and bootstrapped -- on the upgrades to the Blackwell platform.Corporations won't have to worry about how the current GH200 systems integrate with the new Blackwell systems because Jensen and his top-tier CUDA engineers have already built that seamless transition into everything.(end of TAZR commentary excerpt from May 23)Huang's Law > Moore's LawThen in the first week of June came the annual Computex conference in Taiwan. And Jensen made it clear that the Acceleration of GPU computing was driving down nearly all Costs, including Energy usage, and providing powerful platforms for Science, Smart cities, and Simulation.The oddly capitalized words in my previous sentence make up a new handy acronym I devised for technology investors to memorize when trying to understand the revolution that NVIDIA has birthed: ACESx3 is for Acceleration-Cost-Energy-Science-Smart-Simulation.This is how I remember the power of NVIDIA, and the exponential reasons for staying invested in NVDA shares. And all of these letters stand for one of the most powerful ACESx3 innovations for human kind: advances in medicine and cures for our worst diseases.After Computex, and the NVDA 10-for-1 stock split which took effect on June 10, I raised my price target to $200. I had already told investors (and savvy traders) in May that the gap up from $95 ($950 pre-split) was likely never going to be filled (barring WWIII).Here was my commentary for Zacks TAZR members...NVDA to $200Posted on 6/10/24TAZR TradersThis morning we taped the Zacks Ultimate Strategy Session (ZUSS).My Top Stock Pick was, of course, NVIDIA.And I tried to cram a lot (too much) into my 10-minute segment, but of course got lost along the way.I neglected to reiterate the emerging potential of Jensen's roadmap to $1 trillion in annual revenues by 2030 (a slide I showed you from last November).And then I forgot to speak this key statement from my weekend notes that sums up my \"No Cannibalization, Just Multiplicative Bootstrapping Integration\" (that I introduced last week during Computex)...\"ALL OLD and NEW DGX-GPU systems BENEFIT FROM CUDA SOFTWARE UPGRADES, SUCH THAT ALL PREVIOUS GENERATION CHIP-SETS ACTUALLY GET FASTER!\"This is way beyond the \"backward compatibility\" thesis, so it gets lost on most analysts.This is built-in \"acceleration multiplicity.\"To say that the NVIDIA stack of enlightened software that extracts the most from the accelerated hardware is \"an exponential event-horizon for enterprise and science\" is the understatement of the decade.We may not like what Meta, Google, and Amazon do with this massive data-power over society, but the genie is long out of the bottle.Now, we're aboard the ETI (Exponential Technology Innovation) Rocket that I previewed in 2017 in my Technology Super Cycle thesis.And as NVIDIA CUDA-DGX-GPU acceleration has surprised almost everyone to rival Apple and Microsoft valuations, it's also deliciously ironic that the \"Agree to Disagree\" topic for this month's ZUSS was...\"Ben Rains and Kevin Cook will Agree To Disagree on whether the U.S. National Debt matters to the U.S. economy and the market.\"When I last addressed this debate with some degree of interest, it was 3 years ago here...Why the National Debt is IrrelevantIn any case, let's buy all the NVDA shares we can below $120 because my new price target for 2026 is...$200!No one had a $2,000 price target pre-split so just ignore the Wall Street noise and stick with Cooker on the ETI that has yet to be seen!CookerWhat About Gloomy Goldman on the AI Bubble?You've probably heard the hub-bub by now that Goldman research says the \"ROI on AI\" is non-existent. And that means of course that AI is a massive bubble ready to pop.That's some cute \"could happen\" analysis. But it ignores what the Fortune 1000, the Global 2000, and the 20 largest nation-states are really up to: investing deeply for the future they see 5 years from now where if you don't have your own deep learning, automation and LLM expertise, you will be mere gold dust against your competitors.And as I've been predicting since February, the sales estimates for NVIDIA were going to cross $150 billion and head to $200 billion very soon.Well it finally happened this month with an unnamed analyst posting a high-Street peg of $180 billion for next year.I think it might be Tim Arcuri from UBS because on July 8 he talked about his bull case seeing $204 billion for next year. Here's what I posted on Twitter/X that day...UBS analyst Tim Arcuri leads the bulls with the call today for $204 billion next year, despite Goldman handwringing about \u201cno ROI from all those GPUs yet.\u201d Still building the field of dreams AI factories for science and innovation!Bottom line: As I've been saying for 2 years, the analysts are still way behind the curve of what is emerging for NVDA sales over the next 3-5 years.

And they're even more optimistic about the stock than before Nvidia's pullback started.\nOn July 12, Benchmark analyst Cody Acree maintained his buy recommendation for Nvidia and raised its 12-month price target to $170 from $135. This higher target came after Benchmark hosted a fireside chat with Nvidia and investors. After this event, Acree said he had \"increasing conviction\" about Nvidia's continued leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\nThree days later, TD Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay reiterated a buy rating for Nvidia. Ramsay also raised the price target for the stock to $165 from $140. Ramsay believes that the demand for Nvidia's chips is sustainable and predicts another strong quarterly update from the company in August.\nTwo more votes of confidence in Nvidia came on July 22. Loop Capital's Ananda Baruah maintained a buy rating for the stock and raised the price target to $175 from $120. Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar reiterated an overweight rating for Nvidia. Kumar increased his firm's price target for the stock to $140 from $120. He wrote to clients, \"We see the strong business trends exhibited over the prior year by Nvidia set to continue, aided by the official launch of the Blackwell architecture in the October quarter.\"\nLSEG didn't report any downgrades for Nvidia since its recent pullback began. However, not all Wall Street firms are as bullish about the stock as Benchmark, TD Cowen, Loop Capital, and Piper Sandler.\nFifteen of the 38 analysts surveyed by LSEG in July rated Nvidia as a \"hold.\" This group includes DeutscheBank's Ross Seymore, who said in May that it was \"too late to buy\" the stock. Two of the analysts surveyed by LSEG in July were even more pessimistic.\nWhy are so many analysts less enthusiastic about Nvidia? It's not that they don't think the company's GPU sales will continue to grow. Instead, the primary concern is that Nvidia's valuation already reflects this anticipated growth.\nI don't think Nvidia is the no-brainer buy it once was. The euphoria surrounding the initial launch of generative AI models has died down somewhat. However, I believe the stock can and probably will move higher.\nBenchmark's Acree is correct, in my view, that Nvidia will maintain its leadership in the AI chip market. I agree with TD Cowen's Ramsay that Nvidia will deliver another round of impressive results in its second-quarter update. I suspect Piper Sandler's Kumar is right that the company's launch of its Blackwell-based chips will provide a catalyst.\nBlackwell could be a game changer for Nvidia. I'm not sure how much growth the new architecture will generate for the company, but I expect it to be significant. My take is that Nvidia's tremendous run hasn't come to an end. Instead, the stock is likely just taking a breather.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Foo Yun Chee\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Nvidia is set to be charged by the French antitrust regulator for allegedly anti-competitive practices, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, making it the first enforcer to act against the computer chip maker.\nThe French so-called statement of objections or charge sheet would follow dawn raids in the graphics cards sector in September last year, which sources said targeted Nvidia. The raids were the result of a broader inquiry into cloud computing.\nThe world's largest maker of chips used both for artificial intelligence and for computer graphics has seen demand for its chips jump following the release of the generative AI application ChatGPT, triggering regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic.\nThe French authority, which publishes some but not all its statements of objections to companies, and Nvidia declined comment. The company in a regulatory filing last year said regulators in the European Union, China and France had asked for information on its graphic cards.\nThe European Commission is unlikely to expand its preliminary review for now, since the French authority is looking into Nvidia, other people with direct knowledge of the matter said.\nThe French watchdog in a report issued last Friday on competition in generative AI cited the risk of abuse by chip providers.\nIt voiced concerns regarding the sector's dependence on Nvidia's CUDA chip programming software, the only system that is 100% compatible with the GPUs that have become essential for accelerated computing.\nIt also cited unease about Nvidia\u2019s recent investments in AI-focused cloud service providers such as CoreWeave.\nCompanies risk fines of as much as 10% of their global annual turnover for breaching French antitrust rules, although they can also provide concessions to stave off penalties.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is taking the lead in investigating Nvidia as it divvies up Big Tech scrutiny with the Federal Trade Commission, a source familiar with the matter has told Reuters.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Jan Harvey and David Holmes)\n"

        "Text": "Over the past several years, the rise of Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has epitomized the financial fervor surrounding the artificial intelligence gold rush. The sentiment of the entire U.S. market is heavily influenced by this one stock, highlighting its critical role in the current tech landscape.\nThe recent rally in its share price was driven by two main factors: the enormous demand for GPU chips for AI model training amid the generative AI boom and the substantial expansion in its valuation multiples due to continuous upward revisions in the company's growth outlook. With the benefits of AI being widely recognized, it is no surprise that Nvidia, as the largest manufacturer of data center chipsets, is reaping significant benefits.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nNVDA Data by GuruFocus\nIn mid-2024, Nvidia's soaring stock price propelled it to become the most valuable company on Earth, overtaking both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in terms of market capitalization. This achievement will undoubtedly be studied by market historians for years to come. The company has convincingly demonstrated to investors the demand for its AI accelerators is real and enduring, resulting in a significantly increased valuation multiple. The demand for its next-generation H200 and Blackwell platforms remains robust, with demand outstripping supply well into 2025.\nAdditionally, Nvidia's customer base is broadening, with enterprise and consumer internet companies becoming larger customers. Given the company's pace of innovation, I expect it to stay ahead of the competition in the near to medium-term, which bodes well for its future prospects. Nvidia's dominance as the world's largest producer of critical chipsets for next-generation computing is a vital component of the global AI infrastructure. The company holds a 98% revenue share of the data center GPU market, generating $36.20 billion, a more than threefold increase from $10.90 billion in 2022.\nLooking ahead, the company's rapidly expanding business is beginning to segment into different verticals, led by the data center enterprise. Considering these factors, I believe there is still significant upside potential for Nvidia's fundamentals compared to current analyst estimates, which could support further increases in the share price in the second half of the year. However, this growth might occur at a more moderate pace than in the first half as the valuation of shares has, in my opinion, gotten a bit ahead of itself.\nWhile some investors might argue Nvidia's stock is overvalued given its remarkable price surge over the past year, I firmly believe this is merely the beginning of its growth trajectory, although future appreciation may be more moderate. The share price reflects not only the company's current operational performance, but also its future potential in a rapidly expanding market. With management still guiding excellent second-quarter 2025 numbers and market trends indicating durable long-term generative AI demand, I believe Nvidia remains well poised to retain its AI market leadership and that its long-term growth potential is still very much intact.\nSource: Nvidia\nAccording to CEO Jensen Huang, more than $1 trillion in data center infrastructure and hardware will be built over the next four years, doubling the current global supply of computing power. This projection underscores Nvidia's objective of upgrading supply to meet the robust demand for its next-generation H200 and Blackwell platforms, with demand outstripping supply well into 2025.\nThe strong growth in Nvidia's data center business is primarily driven by large cloud providers, which now constitute about 45% of its revenue. These providers are investing heavily in the company's AI infrastructure due to the strong return on investment. Additionally, it has seen a broadening customer base, with enterprises driving strong sequential growth in the data center segment this quarter. For instance, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) expanded its AI training cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs to enhance the performance of its FSD Version 12 and advance its autonomous driving software. Nvidia anticipates the automotive sector will be a major enterprise vertical in the data center segment this year.\nIn March, Nvidia officially announced its new Blackwell platform at the GTC conference. This next generation of GPUs promises significant performance improvements, especially for inferencing workloads, with a 30 times performance increase compared to the H100 GPU-equivalent. The Blackwell GPUs are manufactured using a custom-built 4NP TSMC process, featuring 208 billion transistors. The Blackwell chips, including the B100 and B200, offer enhanced memory capacity, memory bandwidth and floating-point performance metrics, essential for deep learning model training.\nThe GB200 Superchip, consisting of two Blackwell GPUs and one Grace CPU, is priced between $60,000 and $70,000, offering doubled memory capacity and bandwidth compared to previous generations. These advancements are expected to sustain Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market and make its chips more economically sustainable, with up to 25 times lower costs for AI model training workloads.\nSource: Nvidia\nAnother catalyst for Nvidia's top-line growth in the coming quarters is the recovery of its Chinese market. Traditionally accounting for around 20% of total sales, this market faced a downturn due to U.S. restrictions on chip exports. Nvidia responded by tweaking its GPUs to meet government criteria, resulting in the H20, L20 and L2 GPU lineup. Revenue from China reached $2.50 billion for the fiscal first quarter of 2025, a 28% quarter-over-quarter improvement after a steep fall the previous quarter.\nThis indicates Nvidia's data center GPUs for the Chinese market are gaining traction. However, the production costs for these specific GPUs could be higher than those of the H100 GPUs due to increased memory capacity, potentially leading to decreased margins. While Nvidia could see several billions in additional revenue from the recovering Chinese market, this growth might be tempered by muted growth in additional earnings.\nTo understand Nvidia's remarkable rally over the past year, look no further than its core data center business, which grew by an astounding 427% year over year in the last quarter. While many tech companies are focused on their growth rebound strategies, Nvidia has maintained over 100% year-over-year growth for the past four quarters, with each quarter surpassing the previous one.\nSource: Nvidia\nThis growth was largely driven by the Hopper GPU architecture, with demand continuing to increase. Data center revenue comprised 86.60% of total sales for the quarter, highlighting the dominance of this segment.\nNvidia reported total sales of $26 billion, exceeding its guidance by $2 billion and beating analysts' consensus of $24.6 billion. This tremendous growth signals a strong bullish sentiment, attracting investors even at current price levels. The high double-digit growth is particularly impressive compared to its peers, including AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which are experiencing single-digit growth rates.\nSource: Nvidia\nHigh-growth companies typically include a safety buffer of around 5% when announcing guidance to ensure they can comfortably exceed expectations. Applying this to Nvidia, the best estimate for next quarter's revenue would be adding 5% to the recently announced guidance of $28 billion, resulting in expected revenue of $29.40 billion. This projection indicates the tech company's top-line growth could continue at an impressive rate, suggesting that fears of peak revenues are overblown. Huang has stated that demand for the H200 and upcoming Blackwell architectures will exceed supply well into 2025, supporting the outlook for sustained strong top-line growth.\nIn addition to its impressive growth, Nvidia has seen significant expansion in its margins. Achieving over 3,000 basis points of gross margin expansion in less than two years is remarkable for a mega-cap company. The overall gross margin has consistently expanded over the past eight quarters, driven mainly by the data center segment. As the compute and networking mix increases, overall Ebit margins are expected to rise given that this segment boasts 75% margins. This trend is already playing out, with Nvidia's operating leverage allowing it to quadruple its levered free cash flow in the first quarter from $3 billion to $12 billion. Consequently, its total cash grew sequentially from $25.90 billion to $31.40 billion, while total debt remains a manageable $11 billion compared to the company's nearly $3 trillion market cap.\nInnovation is crucial in the semiconductor industry, and Nvidia's advanced GPU technologies have allowed it to nearly monopolize the market. Another bullish indicator is its financial strength, which far surpasses that of major rivals. Intel is grappling with a deep net debt position and a below-one coverage ratio. Although AMD's balance sheet is cleaner, its cash reserves are five times smaller than Nvidia's. This financial advantage gives Nvidia significantly more potential to reinvest in research and development, maintaining its edge.\nSource: Nvidia\nNvidia's exceptional performance in the data center segment, robust growth projections, expanding margins and superior financial strength make it a compelling investment. The company's continued innovation and ability to reinvest in cutting-edge technologies further solidify its dominant position in the market.\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Nvidia might not attract traditional value investors since both intrinsic and relative valuation measures suggest it is not appealing based on normalized growth estimates. Despite the stock rising significantly over the past year, the company's consistent performance and significant revenue growth justify its current price levels. This performance is not merely driven by AI industry hype; it is supported by substantial revenue increases and improving margins. With a 98% market share in the data center GPU market, no competitor is poised to challenge Nvidia's dominance in meeting the rising global data center demand.\nNvidia's continuous innovation keeps it ahead, as data center operators are eager to build new facilities and upgrade existing ones to meet next-generation customer expectations. Over the past two years, the data center segment has become the largest component of its business. According to Markets and Markets, the data center GPU market is projected to grow by 35% annually over the next five years, quadrupling annual demand by 2030. Given this forecast, Nvidia has significant upside potential for its new and existing products.\nSource: AlphaSpread\nWhen considering aggressive 5-year growth estimates, which are appropriate for a company with such growth potential, the data center accelerator market is projected to reach approximately $400 billion by 2027. Nvidia's recent data center revenues indicate the accelerator market is on track to exceed the $100 billion threshold this year, supporting the aggressive estimates in this valuation.\nNvidia's product roadmap, including new offerings like Blackwell, is expected to bolster its competitiveness. Additionally, strong partnerships with major cloud providers are likely to sustain its growth. Using a discount rate of 9.40% and a terminal growth rate of 1% (which is conservative beyond the five-year mark), we can derive a discounted cash flow equity value of $166 per share, indicating an upside of 26% from current levels.\nSource: AlphaSpread\nThis upside is calculated even with the assumption of a gradually decreasing market share for Nvidia (80% market share by 2027) as competing products gain traction and pressure margins. Based on this analysis, I recommend buying Nvidia shares or accumulating more during slight pullbacks. Given the numerous positive catalysts, there is potential for upward revisions in fundamentals, which could lead to substantial gains.\nNvidia's remarkable rise epitomizes the AI-driven financial fervor, reflecting its critical role in the tech landscape. With robust demand for its AI accelerators, continuous innovation and financial strength, the company is well positioned to maintain its leadership in the AI and data center markets. The company's future growth trajectory, backed by substantial revenue increases and expanding margins, presents a compelling investment case even at current levels. As the company continues to capitalize on the AI gold rush, it remains a strong buy, with significant upside potential and enduring market dominance.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped more than 6% on Thursday as chip stocks led a tech-fueled sell-off amid signs of a cooling economy. \nShares of the AI chip heavyweight declined along with the rest of the Tech sector (XLK) after weak economic data released during the session sent the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) yield lower and stocks fell.\nNvidia stock decline was a reversal from the prior session's monster 12% rally after peer AMD (AMD) posted better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance in a sign that investments in AI haven't slowed down.\n\"These hyperscalers ... their capital expenditures are high and potentially even rising into 2025. So this bodes incredibly well for Nvidia,\u201d said Harvest Portfolio Management co-chief investment officer Paul Meeks on Thursday.\nNvidia doesn't reveal who its largest customers are, but according to Bloomberg data, Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) account for more than 40% of Nvidia's top line.\nMicrosoft makes up roughly 19% of the AI chipmaker's revenue, according to Bloomberg data. This week the tech giant revealed capital expenditures of almost $56 billion for the full year ending June 30.\nMicrosoft said it expects to increase its infrastructure investments in fiscal year 2025 more than it did in 2024.\n\"The fear of potentially some of this momentum not lasting, or maybe fear that the revenue trajectory wouldn't be there over the next 12 months or so \u2014 I think is starting to ease,\" CFRA senior equity analyst Angelo Zino told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.\nSocial media giant Meta, which accounts for roughly 10% of Nvidia's revenue, per Bloomberg data, said it expects to see \"significant\" capital expenditures growth in 2025 after posting strong results on Wednesday.\nChip peers, including Broadcom (AVGO), Micron (MU), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), ASML (ASML), and Super Micro (SMCI), also sank on Thursday in a reversal from the prior session.\nThe semiconductor sector as a whole has benefited from the AI frenzy, but Nvidia is seen as the main beneficiary, up roughly 130% year to date. Rival AMD is down roughly 9% since the start of 2024.\n\"Over time, the pie will get bigger. I still think that Nvidia will have most of the slices, and AMD ... they\u2019ll be a good second supplier. But NVDIA will have a hold on this market for as far as the eye can see,\" said Meeks.\nOn Wednesday Morgan Stanley's analysts led by Joseph Moore placed Nvidia on their 'Top Pick' list after a recent pullback from record highs reached in June.\nMorgan Stanley cited five main drivers of the recent decline in Nvidia \u2014 spending plans, competition, export controls, supply chain fears, and valuation worries \u2014 but said, \"Through those concerns, the earnings environment is likely to remain strong, for Nvidia and for the whole AI complex.\"\nThe firm maintained its Overweight rating and $144 price target on the stock.\nNvidia is set to issue its next quarterly report on Wednesday, Aug. 28.\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped more than 6% on Thursday as chip stocks led a tech-fueled sell-off amid signs of a cooling economy. \nShares of the AI chip heavyweight declined along with the rest of the Tech sector (XLK) after weak economic data released during the session sent the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) yield lower and stocks fell.\nNvidia stock decline was a reversal from the prior session's monster 12% rally after peer AMD (AMD) posted better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance in a sign that investments in AI haven't slowed down.\n\"These hyperscalers ... their capital expenditures are high and potentially even rising into 2025. So this bodes incredibly well for Nvidia,\u201d said Harvest Portfolio Management co-chief investment officer Paul Meeks on Thursday.\nNvidia doesn't reveal who its largest customers are, but according to Bloomberg data, Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) account for more than 40% of Nvidia's top line.\nMicrosoft makes up roughly 19% of the AI chipmaker's revenue, according to Bloomberg data. This week the tech giant revealed capital expenditures of almost $56 billion for the full year ending June 30.\nMicrosoft said it expects to increase its infrastructure investments in fiscal year 2025 more than it did in 2024.\n\"The fear of potentially some of this momentum not lasting, or maybe fear that the revenue trajectory wouldn't be there over the next 12 months or so \u2014 I think is starting to ease,\" CFRA senior equity analyst Angelo Zino told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.\nSocial media giant Meta, which accounts for roughly 10% of Nvidia's revenue, per Bloomberg data, said it expects to see \"significant\" capital expenditures growth in 2025 after posting strong results on Wednesday.\nChip peers, including Broadcom (AVGO), Micron (MU), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), ASML (ASML), and Super Micro (SMCI), also sank on Thursday in a reversal from the prior session.\nThe semiconductor sector as a whole has benefited from the AI frenzy, but Nvidia is seen as the main beneficiary, up roughly 130% year to date. Rival AMD is down roughly 9% since the start of 2024.\n\"Over time, the pie will get bigger. I still think that Nvidia will have most of the slices, and AMD ... they\u2019ll be a good second supplier. But NVDIA will have a hold on this market for as far as the eye can see,\" said Meeks.\nOn Wednesday Morgan Stanley's analysts led by Joseph Moore placed Nvidia on their 'Top Pick' list after a recent pullback from record highs reached in June.\nMorgan Stanley cited five main drivers of the recent decline in Nvidia \u2014 spending plans, competition, export controls, supply chain fears, and valuation worries \u2014 but said, \"Through those concerns, the earnings environment is likely to remain strong, for Nvidia and for the whole AI complex.\"\nThe firm maintained its Overweight rating and $144 price target on the stock.\nNvidia is set to issue its next quarterly report on Wednesday, Aug. 28.\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "'Nvidia Is Slowly Becoming The IBM Of The AI Era' Says Former AMD And Tesla Engineer. Here's The Problem With That Comparison",
        "Author": "  Adrian Volenik ",
        "Text": "Jim Keller, a well-known engineer who\u2019s worked at AMD and Tesla and now leads the AI company Tenstorrent, recently said something interesting on the DemystifySci podcast. He thinks Nvidia is becoming like IBM back in the day but in the AI world. While this shows how powerful Nvidia is right now in AI hardware, it also raises some concerns.\nDon't Miss:\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nMark Cuban believes \u201cthe next wave of revenue generation is around real estate and entertainment\u201d \u2014 this new real estate fund allows you to get started with low minimum investment.\nNvidia\u2019s smart move to focus on AI early has paid off big time \u2014 its earnings were over $26 billion in the first quarter of 2024. It\u2019s also one of the top three companies in the world by market valuation, breathing down the necks of Microsoft and Apple.\nThe company is now a major player in the AI hardware market, with its powerful GPUs used by tech giants like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta. It seems that everyone is on the Nvidia hype train, as CEO Jensen Huang calls AI the \"next industrial revolution,\" with Nvidia at the center.\nKeller, an extremely accomplished engineer and entrepreneur, knows what he\u2019s talking about. However, he might not realize just how unfortunate his comment that \"Nvidia is slowly becoming the IBM of the AI era\" is.\nIn the early 1980s, IBM was huge in the personal computer market. Their PCs were everywhere, and saying \"PC\" often meant you were talking about an IBM machine. But, IBM\u2019s reign didn\u2019t last long because of a few key mistakes and growing competition.\nTrending: Sun Belt's booming real estate market prepares for millions of new inhabitants \u2014 Here\u2019s how to find the region's best deals!\nIBM\u2019s strategy of using an open architecture helped it dominate the market initially, but it also made it easy for other companies to make IBM-compatible PCs. These competitors sold similar products at lower prices, which ate into IBM's market share.\nThe partnership between IBM and Microsoft also backfired as Bill Gates\u2019 company retained the rights to sell its operating system (MS-DOS) to other companies, paving the way for the rise of Microsoft Windows.\nAs PC Gamer reports, as Windows became the dominant operating system, PCs became more associated with Microsoft than IBM. IBM\u2019s slow adaptation to market changes and sticking to old business models allowed competitors to gain a foothold. By the 1990s, IBM's PC business was struggling, and in 2005, IBM sold its PC division to Lenovo, leaving the personal computer market.\nSee Also: Many are surprised that they are eligible for a tax reduction on their home, with just a few seconds you can see if you can save in 3 minutes or less.\nNvidia could run into similar problems. As more companies start making AI hardware, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs might get cheaper because of the competition. Technology moves fast, so today\u2019s best chips can become outdated quickly. As Nvidia keeps growing, it could face more competition and rules to follow, just like IBM did.\nIn addition, there\u2019s the $600 billion AI question. As Analyst David Chan from Sequoia writes, there\u2019s a big gap between the money being spent on AI infrastructure and the revenue AI is actually bringing in.\nAI companies need to make about $600 billion a year to earn enough to cover these huge investments.\nChan said the gap was \"only\" $200 billion in September 2023. Even though Nvidia is making a lot of money, the rest of the AI market isn\u2019t growing fast enough.\nKeller\u2019s comparison to IBM is both a compliment and a warning because Nvidia's success now doesn\u2019t guarantee its future. After all, the tech world is full of once market-leading companies that didn\u2019t keep up with changes.\nRead Next:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nWill the surge continue or decline on real estate prices?

Generative AI, the technology behind chatbots, voice recognition and other automated human interactions with computers, often requires the orchestration of numerous pieces of hardware, software and information retrieval. Many companies don\u2019t have the expertise so Nvidia is trying to do that for them, for a fee.\nNvidia founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang showcased his company\u2019s latest offerings Monday at the Siggraph conference in Denver. He\u2019s at the graphics technology conference \u2014 the latest in a stream of appearances at public events \u2014 seeking to persuade as many industries as possible to start using his technology and make AI pervasive in the economy. Later, he is scheduled to appear on stage at the conference with Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\nNvidia\u2019s chips have become central to the surge in building new systems being deployed to support artificial intelligence computing. The company\u2019s revenue doubled last year and is on course to double again in the current fiscal year.\nThe software and services are included in its Nvidia AI Enterprise product, which costs $4,500 per graphics processor used per year. The software and services are designed to work on Nvidia hardware.\n\u201cThe Nvidia NIM is a comprehensive solution for deploying generative AI simplified for developers, but built for applications at scale,\u201d said Kari Briski, Nvidia\u2019s vice president of product management for AI and HPC software development kits.\nNvidia had made about 100 of the inference micro services available in preview and is now releasing completed versions. For example, Getty Images Holdings\u2019 services is getting improved high-resolution image generation by making the software better at understanding text prompts. Shutterstock Inc.\u2019s Edify three-dimensional image generator is going live with the ability to respond to text or images.\nMost AI is used by knowledge workers to help with digital tasks, according to Nvidia. To get generative AI into broader circulation, Nvidia is providing software and services that will allow, for example, users of Apple Inc.\u2019s Vision Pro headset to create virtual worlds. So-called virtual twins will be used for tasks such as training robotic computers to act more like humans, cutting out the need for developers to do it manually, Nvidia said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow to Calculate the Value of an MBA\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products\u2014and Broke Shopping in America\nInside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter\n\u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship\nScammers Target Middle East Influencers With Meta\u2019s Own Tools\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Is Nvidia's Momentum Over? Here's What History Says.",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) soared to record highs earlier this year, crossed the $1,000 mark -- and finally launched a stock split in June to lower its per-share price. The reason for the fantastic performance is simple. Nvidia dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, and this has helped it generate triple-digit gains in earnings in recent times.\nRevenue even reached records quarter after quarter -- and in the most recent quarter, it came in higher than a full year of revenue in 2021. This hasn't been just a short-term story: Nvidia stock advanced more than 2,000% over the past five years.\nIt's clear that this stock has shown plenty of momentum, but the story changed in recent weeks. Though Nvidia shares climbed in the days following its June stock split, from its June 18 high through today, the stock has dropped about 17%. At the same time, rivals are eager to take market share with their top-performing chips, and some experts have warned that the stock market is in a bubble that could be set to burst. Does this mean Nvidia's incredible momentum may be a thing of the past? Here's what history says.\nFirst, let's take a quick look at Nvidia's path so far. The company originally was known for supplying the gaming industry with high-power graphics processing units (GPUs) to make the sights and sounds of their products come to life for players. But the GPU's ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously made it suited for many other uses -- particularly AI.\nThis focus on AI helped Nvidia grow revenue from about $16 billion in a full year in 2021 to $26 billion in just one quarter today. This also helped Nvidia stock start its amazing ascent.\nOf course, Nvidia's path hasn't been a straight line upward. Over the past decade there have been ups and downs, and it's important to look at this history to see what happened after all of the down points. In every case, history shows us that Nvidia stock has always moved higher.\nThis happened even after periods of transition and uncertainty. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2019, Nvidia's gaming revenue suffered, falling in the double digits, due to excess GPU inventory and weak demand from China. Meanwhile, data center revenue roared to records, but this was early in the AI story -- and it wasn't obvious that AI would represent such a valuable area for Nvidia over time.\nWhat does this say about Nvidia's momentum today? It's possible that, as in the past, Nvidia stock could be in a period of declines -- this might be short-lived or may continue for some time. But history shows us that Nvidia has always found new momentum, and I would expect this to continue.\nToday, investors have gotten used to fantastic earnings growth from Nvidia, and they may not reward every bit of good news by piling into the stock. Investors may also be a little cautious about technology giants at the moment as some economists speak of a bubble ready to burst.\nAll this offers long-term investors the opportunity to get in on Nvidia -- and potentially other top players too -- at a reasonable valuation. Though Nvidia, trading at about 40 times forward earnings estimates, isn't cheap, it trades at a fair price considering its market leadership and the innovation that could keep it in that position.\nRight now, as you decide whether to invest in Nvidia, it's important to take a long-term view of the company and its stock performance potential. Nvidia's long-term story remains strong. The company generates billion-dollar earnings today, with growth in the triple digits, and we're in the early days of the AI story.\nAnalysts predict that today's $215 billion AI market will soar to $1 trillion by the end of the decade. Even if the market falls a bit short of this expectation, Nvidia still could have a bright future. It's the go-to company for premium GPUs, it's pledged to update these chips on an annual basis, and it's focused on new areas of AI growth such as sovereign AI.\nHistory shows us that even if Nvidia shares wallow in the doldrums for a time, this stock's long-term momentum is far from over -- and that's why it's still a top technology stock to buy and hold.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Can Nvidia Maintain Its $3 Trillion Valuaiton?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Only three companies have ever eclipsed the $3 trillion market value threshold: Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Although Microsoft and Apple are incredibly large businesses that can justify this valuation, Nvidia has attained its price tag due to its future growth prospects.\nAs a result, the pedestal it's standing on isn't nearly as stable as those other companies. So, can Nvidia maintain this valuation? Or is it primed to tumble?\nNvidia has reached this point on the back of strong artificial intelligence (AI) demand. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are essential to developing and maintaining these AI business models.\nGPUs are the hardware of choice for AI because they can run so many calculations in parallel. Additionally, GPUs can be connected in clusters to multiply this effect. This allows for huge AI systems to be trained efficiently and effectively, and is the driver behind Nvidia's incredible rise during the past year and a half.\nFurthermore, Nvidia is also the top dog in its industry by a wide margin. Second-place Advanced Micro Devices is also in the AI market but doesn't offer technology that matches Nvidia's.\nDue to the high demand for its primary product, Nvidia's trailing-12-month revenue increased from about $30 billion to $80 billion in just over a year.\nFor its fiscal 2025 year (ending January 2025), Wall Street analysts on average expect Nvidia to do $120 billion in sales, rising to $161 billion in FY 2026. That's still a huge increase, and many investors would be elated by that rise.\nHowever, much of that growth is already baked into the stock price.\nAlthough sales growth drives a company's future, investors care about earnings. As a result, metrics like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or the forward P/E ratio are quite popular for valuing stocks.\nFor Nvidia, these two metrics are in stark contrast to each other.\nWith Nvidia trading at 72 times trailing earnings and 46 times forward earnings, it's easy to calculate that investors have baked in 59% earnings growth into the share price. While that's a huge figure, Nvidia has far exceeded that in recent reports. In Q1 FY 2025 (ended April 28), Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) rose 629% year over year.\nHowever, investors shouldn't expect these jaw-dropping figures to continue. The year-over-year comparison quarters are about to become more difficult as we're starting to overlap the initial GPU rush that started in Q2 last year.\nHowever, the question remains: Can Nvidia maintain its $3 trillion valuation?\nThe other two members of the $3 trillion club, Microsoft and Apple, have traded at about 30 times trailing earnings during the past five years. Although that is historically expensive relative to the rest of the market, both are outstanding companies. Nvidia also is a unique business with incredible profit margins and a clear market lead. As a result, I'll use 30 times earnings as my base case for Nvidia.\nFor a company to be worth $3 trillion and trade at 30 times earnings, it must generate $100 billion in profit annually. During the past 12 months, Nvidia has generated $42.6 billion. This shows that it has a long way to go before attaining the profit levels needed that we calculated.\nAnother factor investors must consider is Nvidia's history. Nvidia has never been as profitable as it is now, and its market leadership position is a huge factor in that.\nWhen you have a product everyone wants, with few viable alternatives, you can charge whatever you want, and the customer will pay it. However, these high prices will spur innovation, which is exactly what is happening. Many of the largest tech companies in the world (which also happen to be Nvidia's largest customers) have started to design their own chips to replace Nvidia GPUs. Although this may not be a big deal right now, it could become a problem for Nvidia when a refresh or upgrade cycle occurs.\nIf we factor in a profit margin drop and reduce the levels to 30%, where Nvidia was before the AI boom, Nvidia would need to generate $333 billion in sales to maintain its valuation. Although Nvidia's profit margins may never revert to historical levels, it's unlikely the company will be able to maintain its current levels as rising competition will begin to erode its margins.\nFor Nvidia to stay above (or around) a $3 trillion market cap, it must maintain its revenue and profit margins. That's no easy task, considering many are coming after the company. While I don't think Nvidia's business will collapse, the stock may see pressure as investors recognize the lofty expectations that already are reflected in the stock price.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n See our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nIn business, profits are a key measure of success; and share prices tend to reflect earnings per share (EPS) performance. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. Commendations have to be given in seeing that NVIDIA grew its EPS from US$0.19 to US$1.73, in one short year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that NVIDIA is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 42.5 percentage points to 60%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for NVIDIA's future EPS 100% free.\nSince NVIDIA has a market capitalisation of US$2.9t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$114b. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.\nNVIDIA's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching NVIDIA very closely. Even so, be aware that  NVIDIA is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...\nAlthough NVIDIA certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with more skin in the game, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have strong insider backing.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

The company's share price fell 1.7% in the session, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nNvidia stock opened the day's trading down as much as 7%, but it was able to climb to a gain of 2.1% on better-than-expected economic data before retreating to bearish territory after some analysts suggested big-tech earnings could continue to underwhelm. Investors have been pivoting away from the artificial intelligence (AI) leader and other megacap tech stocks amid geopolitical risks and valuation concerns, and recent earnings reports from Alphabet and Tesla have added to selling pressures.\nNvidia stock has now fallen in four out of five of its last daily trading sessions. The company's stock is now down roughly 17% from the peak that it reached on June 18. Is it time to buy the high-profile AI stock?\nNvidia has become a battleground stock \u2014 and arguably the single-most influential company when it comes to shaping performance for the stock market at large. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) and other accelerated computing technologies are the go-to platform for powering advanced AI applications.\nThe company's existing strengths in data center computing technologies have been magnified by surging demand for AI services, and the business has seen stellar sales and earnings growth in tandem with the trend. On the other hand, the incredible rise of artificial intelligence technologies is a relatively recent phenomenon \u2014 and that makes it difficult to chart future performance and forecast valuations.\nValuations for AI stocks will likely see significant levels of volatility over the next few years as investors try to assess economic opportunities created by the progression of the tech. But Nvidia has strong competitive advantages thanks to its category-leading GPUs and related software platform, and there's a good chance that the company will retain a dominant position in the most important category of artificial intelligence hardware.\nFor long-term investors looking to build exposure to hardware technologies powering key AI trends, taking a dollar-cost-averaging approach to Nvidia stock looks like a smart move right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Rockstar artificial-intelligence (AI) stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) likely has many investors tied in knots right now. Those who have thus far avoided shares of the company, which makes computer chips critical in AI's development, have missed out on 200% returns over the past year alone. Now, shares have fallen a bit from their highs, which may leave investors wondering if the run is over or if this is just a pause before the stock's next leg higher.\nUnfortunately, nobody can tell you the answer. However, this Fool has done the due diligence to prepare you for what might happen. Is Nvidia a stock to buy now? Here is what you need to know.\nThe investment thesis for Nvidia is straightforward. Technology companies building massive data centers to run powerful artificial intelligence (AI) models are choosing Nvidia's chips -- so much so that experts estimate Nvidia's market share for AI chips is as high as 90%. Nvidia has won this war with a quality product and proprietary software that helps developers easily configure the chips for AI applications.\nThe result has been eye-popping growth that has fueled the stock's meteoric rise over the past few years:\nMoney could continue flowing into AI. Experts predict that America's data center footprint could double by 2030. Lisa Su, CEO of rival company AMD, expects the AI chip market to grow to over $400 billion over the next few years. Better AI models may require increasingly better chips. CEO Jensen Huang has stated that Nvidia is aiming for annual AI chip releases.\nAnalysts believe continued AI chip demand will drive Nvidia's earnings growth by an average of 38% annually for the next three to five years. The stock's forward P/E is 48 today. That's a steep price tag, but it is one that Nvidia could easily grow into if it performed up to analysts' expectations.\nIt's a hopeful story, but things could get ugly if it doesn't go according to plan. Nvidia has grown remarkably fast; total revenue has more than doubled in short order. Maintaining that revenue (and growing it) requires that AI chip demand lives up to the hype and that Nvidia continues owning the lion's share of that market.\nThere are several realistic scenarios in which this might not happen. Nvidia gets a large chunk of its AI sales from a few large technology companies. What if those companies decide to design custom in-house chips instead? Or, what if these companies reach a point where they're not getting a good enough return on investment on these chips? This isn't for fun; AI must make these companies a ton of money to justify spending billions of dollars.\nNone of these questions even factor in the reality that AMD, Intel, and others will all be gunning for Nvidia's market share. Nvidia could retain its market share but face pricing pressure if competitors dramatically undercut its pricing with comparable chips.\nEveryone buying Nvidia stock now is banking on future growth, not what has already happened. Ultimately, the risk to investors is that Nvidia fails to deliver for whatever reason. And because of how giant Nvidia's leap has been so far, going backward could be especially painful.\nThat doesn't mean investors should avoid the stock entirely. As shown above, the stock could still perform well if the company's growth continues. The key is not chasing the stock, and keeping Nvidia to a small percentage of a diversified portfolio.\nNvidia is the perfect opportunity for dollar-cost averaging, building an investment with small, repeated purchases. Slowly accumulating shares means you won't be all-in to the stock too soon. You can steadily increase your investment as Nvidia shows it can maintain its growth. Let the company earn your investment dollars. It also would be less costly to pull your investment and move on if Nvidia gets in trouble.\nIn this scenario, it's heads-you-win, tails-you-win. That's smart investing.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock posted a big gain in Wednesday's trading session, up by 12.8% at the close, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nThe chipmaker got a boost from bullish news in the quarterly reports published by Advanced Micro Devices and Microsoft Tuesday. Both high-profile tech players beat expectations for sales and earnings, and each shared additional details that bode well for Nvidia.\nIn its Q2 report, AMD touted a 115% year-over-year revenue increase for its data center segment. That's likely a positive sign for Nvidia, despite AMD being a competitor in the market.\nNvidia is by far the leader when it comes to making high-powered graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) applications, and AMD's second-quarter results signal that demand in that category remains robust. AMD stock closed out Wednesday up 4.4%.\nMicrosoft's stock actually fell 1.1% after its Azure cloud segment missed some analysts' expectations, but the software giant had good news for Nvidia investors. Microsoft, which is widely believed to be Nvidia's biggest customer, reported that it was continuing to increase its capital expenditures to strengthen its AI initiatives.\nOn the heels of Wednesday's pop, Nvidia is trading at roughly 43 times this year's expected earnings. That's a growth-dependent valuation, but it doesn't look exorbitant when viewed in the context of the company's recent performance, competitive strengths, and untapped growth opportunities.\nIn its fiscal 2025 first quarter (which ended April 28), Nvidia's sales surged 262% year over year to $26 billion, and earnings per share increased 629%. For fiscal Q2, management's guidance was that sales would increase by 107% to $28 billion, and it's likely that its earnings per share will once again more than double. The company is scheduled to publish its fiscal Q2 results after the market closes on Aug. 28.\nExpectations are undoubtedly high for Nvidia, and the stock could remain volatile in the weeks leading up to and following the report. But signs suggest that demand for its hardware has remained strong, and the release of the company's next-generation Blackwell chip platform looks poised to be a major performance catalyst for it later this year.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "After soaring a whopping 194% over the last 12 months, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has richly rewarded its near-term investors as it rides a wave of explosive demand for AI hardware. But so far, this industry has been more hype than substance, and Wall Street is beginning to notice. Let's dig deeper into what the next year could have in store for Nvidia as hype fades and fundamentals start to play a bigger role.\nIn late 2022 and early 2023, financial media was awash with grandiose visions for the future of AI. PwC expected it to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. And Bloomberg Intelligence projected the market to be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032 as the new technology was applied to digital ads, software development, and other services. But now, some on Wall Street are beginning to sing a different tune.\nIn June, Goldman Sachs released a report suggesting that the roughly $1 trillion in capital expenditures (capex) expected to pour into AI hardware over the coming years may exceed the potential returns. And they have a point.\nSo far, most consumer-facing generative AI start-ups are generating significant losses. And over the longer term, free, open-source large language models (LLMs) could also commodify the technology, eroding the economic moats for early leaders. This would hurt Nvidia because if its software clients don't profit from their AI investments, eventually, they will stop spending. But so far, there is no evidence of a slowdown.\nThe good news for Nvidia shareholders is that if the company faces impending doom, there are no signs of it yet. The chipmaker's rocket-ship rally is still backed by incredible operational performance.\nSecond-quarter revenue doubled year over year to $13.51 billion, driven by a 171% increase in the data-center segment where Nvidia sells its highest-end graphics processing units (GPUs), like the H100 and A100 used to train and run AI algorithms. For now, supply seems to be outstripping demand. And the company's gross margin increased from 64.6% to 70.1%, while its profits jumped 843% to $6.19 billion.\nThat said, the AI boom is getting a little long in the tooth. Over the next 12 months, Nvidia will face difficult comps as it tries to maintain growth against already high prior-year numbers. This could eat away at the stock's valuation, which seems to be pricing in continued expansion. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 49, Nvidia trades at a significant premium over the Nasdaq 100's forward estimate of around 30.\nIt can be tempting to bet on Nvidia because of its practically exponential stock-price growth and the recent 10-for-1 stock split which makes the $3.18 billion company look deceptively affordable. However, investors who buy now are very late to the party and run the risk of holding the bag if things go wrong.\nOver the next 12 months and beyond, the AI industry may face a reckoning as hype begins to fade and consumer-facing applications struggle to show enough revenue and earnings potential to justify the industry's spending on chips and other hardware. These challenges could put Nvidia's valuation at risk. And investors may want to stay clear for now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Max Juang ",
        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 5.8% in the afternoon session as investors seem to be rotating out of large-cap tech stocks that have been winners year-to-date. Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple are down today.\nWe observe that the Russell 2000 Index is up 3%, suggesting that investors could be rotating into smaller stocks. The rotation could have been sparked by today's inflation report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It revealed that CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) for the month of June 2024 came in better than expected at 3% year on year (the lowest level in more than three years).\nThe recent inflation prints supported the argument that the Fed will start cutting rates this year as the headline figures moved closer to the 2% target.\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 13 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 16 days ago, when the company gained 6.4% as the stock rebounded after shedding more than $400b in market cap since the previous week. We'd note that there were no specific fundamental reasons driving the move, just as there were no major ones driving the decline in the stock in the previous week or so. The last major fundamental datapoint we had on the company was May 22, 2024, when Nvidia reported Q1'2024 earnings that were quite strong and above expectations.\u00a0\nNvidia is up 166% since the beginning of the year, and at $128.19 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $30,838.\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

A report from Wall Street Journal in June said that all ten AI ETFs tracked by website ETF.com saw inflows this year. One major AI ETF, launched by Roundhill, saw its assets grow to $35 million from under $1 million in just two weeks.\nAmid the craze of AI ETFs, does it make sense to start investing in every new ETF? Analysts offer some guidance. A Wall Street Journal report quoted Morningstar analyst Kenneth Lamont, who said that we should look for \u201cthematic purity\u201d while investing in AI ETFs. The ETF you choose, according to the analyst, must be investing in \u201cbellwether\u201d stocks positioned to benefit from the AI industry trends.\nThere is a new AI ETF in town. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), launched earlier this month, tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, which captures the performance of AI tech companies. The index seeks exposure to three main AI categories: hardware, infrastructure, and applications. The index picks companies by assigning \u00a0AI Exposure Score, which assesses each company\u2019s relevance to AI tech. You can get exposure to AI companies focusing on data centers, LLMs, AI tech to reduce costs and improve customer experience.\nIn this article, we will discuss the top 10 holdings of this new AI ETF and see whether they have the potential to rise in the coming months and weeks. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has \u201cno idea what I\u2019m talking about\u201d or it\u2019s the market that just does not understand.\nAswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the \u201cdriving seat\u201d of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won\u2019t be as easy as the market assumes.\nRecently, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have gained about 206% over the past year.\nRecently, Barclays Tom O\u2019Malley gave bullish comments on the stock, with a $145 price target and an Overweight rating.

        "Title": "3 Charts That Strongly Suggest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Titan Nvidia Is in a Bubble",
        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "This has been a year of milestones. Since mid-May, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average has notched its first close over 40,000, the broad-based S&P 500 climbed above the 5,500 level, and the growth-powered Nasdaq Composite surpassed the 18,000 mark. This full-fledged bull market comes courtesy of the euphoria surrounding the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\nWithout getting overly complex, AI uses software and systems to undertake tasks that humans would normally oversee. What makes AI so special is the ability of software and systems to learn and evolve without human oversight. If AI software and systems become more proficient at their tasks over time or perhaps learn new skills, pretty much every sector and industry of the global economy would benefit.\nAlthough dozens of companies have benefited from investors pouring their capital into the AI revolution, none stands out more than semiconductor titan Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nNvidia's calling card to success has been its AI-driven graphics processing units (GPUs). In particular, the company's H100 GPU has quickly become the go-to chip that allows for split-second decision-making in high-compute data centers.\nAccording to the semiconductor-focused analysts at TechInsights, Nvidia was responsible for shipping 3.76 million of a possible 3.85 million AI GPUs in 2023. Businesses have lined up to purchase the H100 to train large language models and run generative AI solutions.\nOne of the key advantages for Nvidia is that enterprise demand for AI GPUs has handily outpaced supply. Based on the law of supply and demand, the price of a good or service is liable to increase if the supply of said good or service is insufficient to meet demand. Nvidia has been able to rapidly increase the price of its GPUs, which, in turn, sent its adjusted gross margin to more than 78% during the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28).\nDespite its first-mover advantages, this market-leading company isn't sitting on its laurels. In the latter half of 2024, it's expected to roll out its next-generation AI GPU architecture, known as Blackwell. This new platform can expedite quantum computing, data processing, engineering simulations, and generative AI solutions, among other tasks.\nBeyond Blackwell, CEO Jensen Huang teased its next-gen Rubin platform to the world in June. Rubin will have an all-new central processing unit (known as Vera) and is set to make its debut in 2026. In other words, Nvidia appears to have a path to sustained compute advantages over its peers.\nAlthough Nvidia has absolutely crushed Wall Street's loftiest revenue and profit projections for more than a year, and its operational ramp has been nothing short of textbook, evidence is mounting that it may be in a bubble.\nWhile history doesn't repeat to a T on Wall Street, it does have a tendency to rhyme. Based on three compelling charts, we may have already witnessed a top for Wall Street's hottest AI stock.\nOver the last 30 years, Wall Street and investors have had no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends to chase. The advent of the internet, genome decoding, business-to-business commerce, China stocks, nanotechnology, 3D printing, blockchain technology/cryptocurrency, cannabis, and the metaverse have captivated the attention of new and seasoned investors.\nBut these trends share a similarity: early-stage bubbles.\nAlthough it's impossible to predict when the music will stop, industry-leading businesses for all of the above trends eventually face-planted.\nAs you can see in the chart above, some of the buzziest investments over the last quarter of a century have nosedived after the bubble burst for their respective innovation, technology, or trend. In no particular order:\nThe networking/e-commerce revolution saw Amazon and Cisco Systems shed in the neighborhood of 90% of their values during the dot-com bubble.\n3D Systems and Stratasys, which led the 3D printing hype, have never come close to replicating their ascents from their early 2010s and currently sit 97% and 94% below their respective all-time highs.\nCanadian cannabis stock Canopy Growth has plummeted a whopping 99% since hitting its record-closing high.\nCryptocurrency play Coinbase Global dumped nearly 90% from its peak close before rebounding.\nSocial media maven Meta Platforms, which had been the face of the metaverse, plunged by about 80% before rallying to new highs.\nThe point I'm trying to make is that investors have overestimated the uptake of every new technology or trend for the last 30 years, and there's no reason to believe that AI is going to be any different. History (i.e., the above chart) strongly suggests that lofty growth forecasts for AI aren't going to be achieved, and a period of maturation will be needed for this potentially game-changing technology.\nA second reason to suspect Wall Street's AI leader is in a bubble can be seen in the company's current and forecast adjusted gross margin.\nAs I noted earlier, Nvidia has undeniably benefited from AI GPU demand outpacing supply. The ability to raise its prices has sent its adjusted gross margin higher by 13.72 percentage points over the previous five quarters.\nBut as you can see in the chart above, an adjusted gross margin of around 60%, give or take a few percentage points in either direction, has been the norm over the trailing-10-year period. While this doesn't dismiss that Nvidia has steadily improved its adjusted gross margin over time, it does suggest that a 13.72-percentage-point increase in 15 months is unsustainable.\nFor instance, Nvidia guided to an adjusted gross margin of 75.5% (+/- 50 basis points) for the fiscal second quarter. Although this is still well above its historic average, a sequential decline of 235 to 335 basis points for the current quarter suggests that margin pressures are beginning to take shape.\nDuring the second half of 2024, Intel will roll out its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerator chip on a broad-scale basis, and Advanced Micro Devices will beef up production of its MI300X AI GPU. Further, Nvidia's top four customers are all internally developing AI GPUs for their respective data centers.\nEven if Nvidia's AI GPUs easily retain their compute advantages, overwhelming enterprise demand for GPUs may allow these competitors to thrive\u00a0and/or reduce data center space for Nvidia's chips. In short, Nvidia's fiscal second-quarter margin guidance looks like a warning that its adjusted gross margin has peaked.\nThe third damning chart for Nvidia has to do with its valuation.\nTo be fair, some traditional fundamental metrics suggest Nvidia could still be something of a bargain for long-term investors. For instance, Nvidia's shares ended the July 2 session at close to 34 times forward-year earnings. While this is a higher forward-year earnings multiple than the benchmark S&P 500, it's not unreasonable when you factor in that Wall Street is forecasting an annualized earnings growth rate of 46% for the company through 2028.\nHowever, another valuation metric is undeniably concerning.\nAs you can see in the chart above, Nvidia is valued at more than 38 times its trailing-12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. For market-leading businesses on Wall Street, this is one of the highest readings we've ever witnessed. In fact, the reading of 42 times TTM P/S that Nvidia reached in mid-June effectively matched the peak from Amazon and Cisco Systems prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble.\nHistory has consistently shown us that extended valuations can be powered by euphoria over the short run. But when examined over an extended timeline, market leaders with nosebleed P/S ratios are eventually pummeled. Although there's no concrete way to know ahead of time when a top has occurred, we've seen this scenario play out before, and the end result hasn't been pretty.\nWhile Nvidia has the tools to remain a successful company over the very long term, these historic charts strongly suggest that the most direct AI beneficiary is in a bubble.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -1.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +133.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +106.2%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.37 indicates a change of +25.7% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.3%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nvidia.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $28.24 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +109%. The $117.55 billion and $151.38 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +93% and +28.8%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNvidia reported revenues of $26.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +262.1%. EPS of $0.61 for the same period compares with $0.11 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.02%. The EPS surprise was +11.48%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Nvidia promises up to 700% return on investment on GPU doing AI inference work as world's most valuable company continues journey towards $4 trillion market cap",
        "Author": "  Wayne Williams ",
        "Text": "Nvidia temporarily became the most valuable company in the world back in June 2024 with a worth of $3.34tn, a price that's nearly doubled since the start of this year - and although it has now dipped back below Microsoft and Apple for now, it's only a matter of time before the company claims the top spot once again.\nHPCwire reports at the Bank of America Securities 2024 Global Technology Conference, Ian Buck, Vice President and General Manager of Nvidia\u2019s hyperscale and HPC business, discussed the financial advantages of investing in GPUs.\n\u201cEvery dollar a cloud provider spends on buying a GPU, they make it back at $5 over four years,\u201d Buck claimed. Inferencing tasks lead to even higher profitability: \u201cHere the economics are even better: for every dollar spent, $7 is turned over in that same time period and growing,\u201d he said.\nNvidia is optimizing its products to meet the increasing demand for AI inference, using Nvidia Inference Microservices (NIMs), which support popular AI models like Llama, Mistral, and Gemma. The company is also focusing on its new Blackwell GPU, which is specially designed for inferencing and improving energy efficiency.\nInitially supply might be tighter than Nvidia would like, but the company isn't concerned. \u201cWith every new technology transition comes\u2026 a mix of challenges of supply and demand. We experienced that certainly with Hopper, and there\u2019ll be similar kinds of supply-demand constraints in the ramp of Blackwell\u2026 at the end of this year and going into next year,\u201d Buck said.\nLooking to the future, Nvidia has already begun sharing details about its Rubin GPU, announced at Computex and expected to ship in 2026, with cloud providers. Buck highlighted the importance of early collaboration, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s really important for us to do that - data centers don\u2019t drop out of the sky, they\u2019re big construction projects.\u201d\nNvidia's steady progress in AI and GPU technology looks promising for investors, and the $4 trillion market cap seems within reach. The path ahead isn't that clear, however. Due to its rapid growth, Nvidia is facing inevitable scrutiny from antitrust authorities, and this isn't expected to go away any time soon.\nNvidia has virtually recreated the entire planet\nNvidia officially becomes the world's most valuable company\nNvidia is taking the Apple Vision Pro to the Omniverse\n"

        "Author": "  Kayode Omotosho ",
        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 6.1% in the morning session after Bloomberg reported that the Biden Administration is planning to implement tighter trade restrictions if semiconductor companies continue granting China access to technologies made in the United States. The report follows ongoing trade tensions between both countries, which might raise uncertainty about market dynamics in the semiconductor segment heading into the new earnings season.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 14 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago, when the stock dropped 5.8% as investors seemed to be rotating out of large-cap tech stocks that have been winners year-to-date.\u00a0 We observed that the Russell 2000 Index rose 3%, suggesting that investors could be rotating into smaller stocks. The rotation could have been sparked by the inflation report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It revealed that CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) for the month of June 2024 came in better than expected at 3% year on year (the lowest level in more than three years).\nThe recent inflation prints supported the argument that the Fed will start cutting rates this year as the headline figures moved closer to the 2% target.\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\nNvidia is up 143% since the beginning of the year, but at $116.94 per share it is still trading 13.8% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $27,561.\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "Title": "Prediction: Nvidia Will Climb in the Second Half Thanks to This 1 Game-Changing Move",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been on fire for the past few years for a very good reason: The company's dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Nvidia holds an 80% share, and due to its commitment to innovation, this leadership could continue. All of this has translated into triple-digit earnings growth and investor optimism about the company's future.\nAnd that helped Nvidia continue its path higher this year, soaring nearly 150% in the first half. The stock has taken a bit of a pause in recent weeks following its stock split, but I don't think this lackluster performance will last for long. In fact, my prediction is Nvidia stock will climb in the second half thanks to one game-changing move the company is about to make.\nFirst, a quick recap of Nvidia's path so far. The tech giant sells the world's top-performing graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that drive the most essential AI tasks, and an entire ecosystem of products and services for customers developing AI projects. Nvidia's GPUs originally were most known for powering video games -- and the company still generates revenue here -- but today AI has become the company's biggest business.\nIn the recent quarter, data center revenue surged to a record of more than $22 billion -- that's on a total of $26 billion in revenue. Nvidia also is highly profitable, generating more than $14 billion in net income and growing gross margin to about 78% from 64% in the year-earlier period.\nAll of this has helped the stock advance not only this year but in recent years. Over the past five years, Nvidia has soared 2,900%, and the stock roared past $1,000 back in May. The company recently completed a 10-for-1 stock split, bringing down its shares to less than $130. Though this doesn't change anything fundamental about the company such as its market value or valuation, the move does make it easier for a broader range of investors to get in on the stock.\nAfter Nvidia's mind-blowing performance though, some investors worry the stock might lose its momentum. But here's the one game-changing move that could send this innovative player higher in the second half. I'm talking about Nvidia's upcoming launch of its Blackwell architecture and its best-performing chip yet. Demand for Blackwell already has surpassed supply, and the company expects this to continue into next year. The system is in production right now, with Nvidia aiming to make it globally available later this year.\nThe company predicts \"fast and broad adoption\" across its range of customers and their projects thanks to its rollout strategy. More than 100 original equipment manufacturer and original design manufacturer systems will include Blackwell at the launch -- and every major computer maker will be part of this.\nWhy is Blackwell such a big deal? Because the architecture delivers 4 times faster training and 30 times faster inference than Nvidia's current top performer, the H100. And when customers save on time, they not only make their AI projects operational faster, but they also save on costs. In fact, Nvidia says Blackwell results in a 25 times lower total cost of ownership for a customer compared to its current Hopper architecture. So, Blackwell should be a major step forward for Nvidia and its customers.\nNow let's talk a little more about my prediction. Since Nvidia plans to release Blackwell later this year, I would expect to see the impact on revenue growth next year -- but I still think this launch could act as a positive catalyst for stock performance in the months to come, especially if Nvidia continues to report high demand in upcoming quarters. As investors anticipate earnings growth ahead, they may choose to get in on this stock now -- and potentially benefit as Blackwell revenue starts rolling in.\nI wouldn't expect Nvidia shares to replicate their triple-digit first-half performance, but considering the company's earnings growth over the past several quarters and the idea that Blackwell could serve as a significant new growth driver, I wouldn't be surprised to see Nvidia stock climb in the double digits in the second half. After all, analysts forecast average annual earnings-per-share growth of more than 46% over the coming five years.\nFinally, here's the best news of all: Even if I'm wrong and Nvidia stock falters in the second half, the company, thanks to its solid market position and innovation, has what it takes to benefit from AI growth over time -- and this could lead the stock significantly higher in the years to come.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) a Good Edge Computing Stock to Buy Right Now?",
        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Edge Computing Market Size and 7 Best Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other edge computing stocks.\nThe information technology sector has consistently outperformed investor and analyst expectations in 2023, and this trend appears to be continuing into the current year. This impressive performance can largely be attributed to significant advancements such as the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI, which have driven tech stock prices to unprecedented highs. Of course, AI is not the only area that is revolutionizing the technology space. Edge Computing comes in as another compelling area of growth and investment. Also known as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) or Multi-Access Edge Computing, Edge Computing focuses on bringing computing power closer to where data is generated, rather than relying on a centralized cloud-based system. In layman's terms, Edge Computing involves relocating part of the storage and computing capabilities from a central data center to locations near the data sources.\nBy keeping computational capacity close to users, devices, or data sources, edge solutions offer benefits such as reduced latency, increased bandwidth, local device processing, and data offloading. For instance, smart speakers perform minimal computational work, sending requests to servers owned by the provider. With Edge Computing, smart speakers could process a user\u2019s request entirely on the device itself. Gartner, in its March 2024 Market Guide for Edge Computing, states:\n\u201cBy placing data, data management capabilities and analytic workloads at optimal points, ranging all the way to endpoint devices, enterprises can enable more real-time use cases. In addition, the flexibility to move data management workloads up and down the continuum from centralized data centers or from the cloud-to-edge devices will enable greater optimization of resources.\u201d\nThe automotive industry is a prime example of rapid advancements driven by edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI) integration in recent years. As vehicles evolve to incorporate self-driving capabilities, these technologies have become essential for effective decision-making and real-time responses. For instance, Tesla leverages extensive real-world driving data to refine its AI algorithms for autonomous driving. The rollout of EV maker's Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to more drivers highlights its performance in real-world conditions, with the vast amount of visual data collected during these drives enhancing the company's AI learning process.\nFurthermore, the advent and adoption of 5G, the fifth generation of cellular network technologies offering substantially greater bandwidth, is accelerating the growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and facilitating the widespread adoption of edge computing. With 5G networks enabling lightning-fast speeds and a greater number of connected devices, data volumes are expected to surge. Predictions state that by 2025, every connected person will interact with digital data at least once every 18 seconds, largely due to the billions of IoT devices projected to generate over 90 zettabytes of data by then.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global edge computing market was valued at $15.96 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from $21.41 billion in 2024 to $216.76 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate of 33.6% over the forecast period. This growth is fueled by the increasing adoption of edge devices, ranging from IoT devices such as mobile point-of-sale kiosks and smart cameras to computational infrastructure that enables faster and real-time data analysis at the source. On the other hand, PwC projects that the global market for edge data centers will nearly triple, growing from $4 billion in 2017 to $13.5 billion this year. This expansion is driven by the potential of locally situated data centers to reduce latency, manage intermittent connections, and facilitate data storage and computation close to end-users.\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best edge computing stocks to buy now.\nOur Methodology\nFor our list of the best edge computing stocks, We began by sifting through ETFs' holdings and online rankings to gather a preliminary list of 15 stocks. We then scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s first-quarter database which tracks 920 elite money managers and selected the top seven that were the most widely held by hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 186\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an American multinational technology company incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Renowned for its expertise in developing integrated circuits, the company's products are used in various devices, including electronic game consoles and personal computers (PCs). The NVIDIA EGX platform notably extends the power of accelerated computing from data centers to edge locations, providing a range of optimized hardware components along with user-friendly deployment, applications, and management software.\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s first-quarter database, 186 hedge funds held stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), up from 173 in the previous quarter. One of the prominent stakeholders is Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners, with nearly 13.36 million shares valued at $12.07 billion.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently shook the market again as one of the world\u2019s largest tech ETFs is on the brink of a significant shift due to the chipmaker surpassing Apple Inc. in market size. Due to diversification rules, the $67 billion Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund has held significantly fewer NVDA shares for months, even as the AI giant's value has soared. Currently, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) accounts for roughly 6% of the fund\u2019s assets, compared to 21% in the S&P 500 Information Technology Index, causing XLK to underperform significantly this year. With the company's recent surge past Apple in value, its representation in XLK could see a substantial increase during the ETF's quarterly rebalance at the end of this month.\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA): NVDA shares were our top contributor in the quarter following blowout 4Q results and 1Q guidance driven by strong data center sales.

        "Author": "  Jowi Morales ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nThe Chairman of the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) and SK Group, Chey Tae-won, warned attendees at the recent 47th KCCI Jeju Forum \"If AMD, Arm, and other competitors of Nvidia sell high-quality chips for lower prices, Nvidia's model may fall apart.\" During his speech, he also likened the current AI boom to the California Gold Rush in the mid-1800s.\nChey expects that AI chip maker Nvidia will continue to be among the top corporations by capitalization over the next three years, much like how pickax and jeans makers prospered during the peak of the gold rush.\u00a0However, \"When there was no more gold, the sellers became unable to sell pickaxes,\" the Korea Times quotes Chey saying during the forum. He continued, \"Without making money, the AI boom could vanish, just as the gold rush disappeared.\"\nNvidia became the world's most valuable company last month propelled by its record sales of data center GPUs in 2023. While its stock price has already experienced some market correction, it is still the third most valuable corporation in the world. With no signs that AI development is slowing down, we can expect Nvidia to retain its lead for the foreseeable future.\nHowever, the cost of training the next generation of AI LLMs is increasing exponentially. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that AI models currently undergoing training cost $1 billion, with $100 billion models expected to arrive as early as 2025. The increasing costs of AI development has Goldman Sachs concerned, with some of its staff saying that AI is overhyped and asking whether the massive investments in it will ever pay off.\nWe believe that AI is now a part of our reality, but unless businesses find a profitable use for this tool, then there's a chance the AI race could turn into a bubble that will implode. If that happens, investment in specialized hardware designed to run these processes will take a nosedive, potentially taking Nvidia with it.\nNevertheless, we do not expect Team Green to fold just because of this scenario. After all, AI wasn't even around when Jensen Huang thought of Nvidia. The company could always fall back on the gaming industry as its primary customer base, and its cards will always find use in other applications.\nThe real threat to Nvidia would be its competitors. Although AMD makes some decent GPUs, it lags in supersampling technology, with some considering FSR 3.0  to still be miles behind DLSS 3.5. It is quickly catching up, though, and Intel is also making inroads in the GPU market with its Intel Arc GPUs and XeSS supersampling technology.\nIndividuals and institutions will keep on buying Nvidia's products as long as it has a product that delivers unparalleled performance \u2014 but its competitors are not asleep at the wheel. And with AI companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and OpenAI investing in their own hardware research, there might come a time when Nvidia will be left in the dust for AI acceleration.\n"

        "Text": "The paradigm shift represented by artificial intelligence (AI) is having a pronounced effect on the tech landscape, and nowhere is that more apparent than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company provides the chips with the computational horsepower to power AI, driving its financial results and stock price into the stratosphere. Nvidia stock is up more than 200% over the past year, resulting in a 10-for-1 stock split, which was completed just last month.\nDespite the stock's impressive run, Wall Street is reviewing its pricing models, and one analyst believes Nvidia still has plenty of upside ahead.\nUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri reiterated his buy rating on Nvidia stock and increased his price to $150. That represents potential upside for investors of 19%, compared to the stock's closing price on Friday. The analyst believes that Nvidia's recent focus on rack-scale servers is underappreciated and could spark additional gains for the chipmaker.\nIn March, Nvidia released details for its GB200 NVL72 system, powered by its GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip. The processor contains \"two high-performance NVIDIA Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs [graphics processing units] and the NVIDIA Grace CPU with the NVLink-Chip-to-Chip (C2C) interface.\" The platforms are packed with either 36 or 72 GB200 GPUs, delivering up to 1.8 terabytes of throughput per GPU.\nArcuri's channel checks suggest that demand for the Blackwell servers is \"exceedingly robust,\" noting that demand was \"materially larger\" than when he checked just two months ago. This could help push Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) to $5 in 2025. For context, the company generated split-adjusted EPS of $1.19 for fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), so this represents a potential increase in profits of 320%.\nI think the analyst hit the nail on the head. Every time Nvidia expands its domain, the company also increases its total addressable market and potential for greater profitability.\nNvidia's stock is currently selling for 75 times forward earnings. However, if the analyst's calculations are correct, the stock is currently trading for 24 times forward earnings, a bargain given the opportunity ahead.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Will Nvidia Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's been nearly impossible to escape coverage on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) over the last year, as its stock has been on a historic bull run, soaring 762% since the start of 2023. The chipmaker's rise dwarfed the growth of many of the most prominent tech companies, including Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which saw its stock increase by 80% in the same period.\nThe disparity between the companies' stock growth is significant, considering Apple is the world's most valuable company with a market cap of $3.5 trillion. Nvidia's rally has seen it become the first chipmaker to achieve a market cap above $3 trillion, putting it third on the list of most valuable companies (after Microsoft, which is in second).\nNvidia's swift rise saw it temporarily overtake Apple in market cap earlier this year, but it didn't last. However, the chipmaker's consistent ability to outpace Apple in growth suggests it's a matter of when, not if, Nvidia will one day be worth more than Apple. Meanwhile, the company's dominance in the chip market and lead over its competitors indicates that day might not be very far away.\nSo, will Nvidia be worth more than Apple by 2025? Let's assess.\nNvidia's recent rally was primarily driven by its dominance in artificial intelligence (AI). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the preferred hardware for developers worldwide, with Nvidia now responsible for an estimated 70% to 95% of the AI chip market.\nThe company's success in the industry has seen its earnings skyrocket over the last year, even while rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel launched competing products.\nNvidia has taken a massive financial leap Nvidia over its competitors in the last 12 months, with far more revenue, operating income, and free cash flow. The figures suggest Nvidia is far better equipped than AMD and Intel to continue reinvesting in its technology and stay ahead in AI.\nComparatively, Apple's AI competitors are in similar financial positions to the iPhone maker. Microsoft and Alphabet are investing heavily in the generative technology, even pulling ahead of Apple since the start of 2023, and have the financial resources to do so. As a result, Apple will likely continue to face fiercer competition in AI than Nvidia, which could mean slower earnings and stock growth as it develops in the sector.\nAdditionally, Nvidia's more established position in AI means it's already enjoying major gains from selling its hardware to the industry. At the same time, it remains to be seen if Apple will, in fact, attract consumers to the soon-to-be-launched AI features in its iPhones, Macs, and iPads.\nPast chip trends indicate it will be an uphill battle for Nvidia's competitors to chip away at its leading market share in AI. For instance, Nvidia's share of the discrete desktop GPU market has grown from 65% in 2014 to 88% this year. The company's position has risen despite AMD's investment in the sector, with AMD's share falling from 35% to 12% in the same period.\nA similar example has occurred with central processing units (CPUs). Since 2017, AMD's CPU market share has risen from 18% to 33%. While Intel's position in the industry has declined since then, it has held onto its majority market share, which was 64% as of the first quarter of 2024.\nHistorical trends in the chip market show that once a company takes a dominant position, it can be nearly impossible for a competitor to steal the top spot. As a result, Nvidia will likely retain its dominance in AI GPUs for years, especially as it continues widening the financial gap to its peers.\nMeanwhile, in the first six weeks of 2024, Apple's iPhone sales tumbled 24% in China, while domestic rival Huawei's smartphone sales soared 64%. Apple has responded to the market shift by introducing heavy discounts on its iPhones. However, the situation suggests Apple's dominance in some regions could be more fickle than previously thought.\nNvidia's business has exploded since the start of 2023 and has shown no signs of slowing. Apple has delivered solid stock growth more recently, hitting a new high in its share price this year. However, Nvidia's lead in AI and more extensive financial resources than its competitors indicate it could surpass Apple in 2025.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Long-term investing is the key to generating sustainable returns in the stock market. Perhaps few will understand this better than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shareholders, who have enjoyed total returns of more than 3,000% during the past five years despite challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and rising interest rates, which crushed many stocks in the short term.\nBut what could the next half-decade have in store for this powerful technology leader? \nSince the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry has scrambled to accumulate generative artificial intelligence (AI) hardware, such as Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), which provide the processing power necessary to run and train AI's complex algorithms. Nvidia's second-quarter earnings demonstrate how this new demand has transformed its operations.\nRevenue doubled year over year to $13.51 billion, driven by sales of high-end data center GPUs such as the H100. Profits jumped eightfold to $6.18 billion. And management aims to extend the company's dominance by accelerating the pace at which it releases new AI chips from biennially to annually, which will put even more pressure on its competition.\nNvidia is also expanding into new opportunities like custom chips, a $30 billion opportunity to serve clients with needs for their AI workloads that aren't as well-served by one-size-fits-all solutions.\nAll in all, the company looks capable of maintaining its 80% market share in the AI chip sector for the next five years and possibly beyond. \n Though its market cap has more than doubled in 2024 alone, Nvidia stock may seem reasonably priced when measured against its bottom line. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of about 49, the company's expected future earnings are valued at a premium to the NASDAQ 100's average of 29 -- no surprise considering the company's growth rate (first quarter earnings soared 628% year over year to $14.9 billion). But this situation is much more complicated than it looks on the surface. \nMost of today's large tech companies built up their earnings over decades with businesses well integrated into the productive economy. But this is not necessarily the case for most of Nvidia's explosive growth since 2022. The chipmaker has become overreliant on the speculative AI industry, which currently isn't generating much in the way of either earnings or cash flow.\nAccording to Sequoia Capital, the AI industry has already spent $50 billion on Nvidia's AI chips, while generative AI start-ups have only earned $3 billion in revenue. In other words, so far, the AI boom has been based on the proverbial selling picks and shovels to miners instead of actually getting gold out of the ground. This is an unsustainable situation -- unless things change, eventually, those \"miners\" won't be able to afford their hardware expenses. \nBearing this uncomfortable fact in mind, Nvidia's stock isn't cheap, because its current valuation assumes demand for AI GPUs will remain elevated. And this is far from guaranteed. \nOver the long term, Nvidia could sail through some of its biggest near-term challenges. While many consumer-facing AI businesses are losing money right now, they could eventually mature into profitable enterprises capable of sustaining enormous spending on Nvidia chips. \nThe industry could also diversify with contributions from AI use cases like self-driving cars and robotics, which would be great news for Nvidia shareholders. \nBut these are all what-if scenarios. And with Nvidia's stock currently priced for perfection, betting on this long-term thesis looks risky. It may make more sense to hold off until more information becomes available. \nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best High Growth Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other high growth stocks.\nAt Wall Street, long-standing investment strategies are being reshuffled as the monetary and political landscape evolves. Reallocation is the name of the game in a week where the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced declines of 1.97% and 3.65%, respectively, marking their largest weekly losses since April. Conversely, the Dow advanced 0.72%, and the small cap-focused Russell 2000 climbed 1.68%. A few tech mega-caps\u2014led by Apple Inc., NVIDIA Corporation, Meta Platforms, Inc., and Amazon.com, Inc.\u2014have dominated stock market returns, especially over the last 18 months, a trend that is evident in the diverging performances of the largest 50 stocks in the S&P 500, weighted by market capitalization. This trend, however, seems to have reversed sharply recently, with mega-caps selling off while the average stock holds close to record levels.\nInvestors are grappling with this sudden shift, and one possible explanation is that mega-caps may have become too expensive. \"The stock market is experiencing a long overdue rotation,\" said Glen Smith, chief investment officer at GDS Wealth Management. \"Investors are pulling money out of high-performing big tech stocks and reallocating it to other market areas.\" Notably, tech\u00a0giants like NVIDIA Corporation, previously popular among options traders, saw a notable shift in sentiment, with demand for bearish puts surpassing calls at the highest rate in five months. \"It signals a different regime,\" said Erika Maschmeyer, a portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. \"The market could be choppier and more volatile, with more dispersion than we have seen.\"\nThis divergence has reassured some Wall Street experts who had been concerned about the rally's dependence on a few massive tech stocks. Additionally, rising optimism about forthcoming interest rate decreases from the Fed has bolstered smaller and more cyclically oriented names. In that regard, the Fed's battle against inflation might be nearing its end after U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in June. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee considers the latest inflation data \"excellent\" and describes persistent housing inflation improvement as \"profoundly encouraging.\" However, Scott Rubner of Goldman Sachs is skeptical about buying the dip. The tactical strategist believes the S&P 500 has little room for upward movement from its current position. He points out that historically, July 17 has marked a turning point for the equity benchmark, with data dating back to 1928 supporting this claim. Rubner notes that August typically sees the worst outflows from passive equity and mutual funds.\nOn another note, the U.S. economy added slightly more jobs than expected in June. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 206,000 for the month, surpassing the Dow Jones forecast of 200,000 but falling short of the revised May gain of 218,000, which was significantly reduced from the initial estimate of 272,000. However, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4.1%, matching the highest level since October 2021 and presenting a mixed signal for Federal Reserve officials considering their next monetary policy move. The jobless rate was forecasted to remain steady at 4%. Although June job creation exceeded expectations, much of this growth was driven by a 70,000 surge in government jobs. Additionally, the health care sector, a consistent leader, added 49,000 jobs, while social assistance contributed 34,000 and construction increased by 27,000.\nThe 2024 presidential election is heating up, with President Joe Biden opting not to run for re-election and Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump continuing his campaign after surviving an assassination attempt. Historically, presidential election years have often brought strong returns for stock investors, influencing short-term economic policy. However, recent events suggest that this election year may be far from typical.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the best high growth stocks to buy, we identified companies with strong sales growth over the past five years.

        "Text": "By Suzanne McGee\n(Reuters) - Making leveraged bets on Nvidia is likely to get much riskier if Wall Street's tech-led selloff continues.\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to magnify the daily moves in the chipmaker's shares by as much as two times have been a popular vehicle for investors seeking to jump on the stock's meteoric rise this year, with total assets swelling to about $6.3 billion as of this week from only $342 million in December 2023, according to data from CFRA.\nBut while the stock's roughly 130% year-to-date rally has rewarded bullish bets, recent turbulence in tech shares could amp up the risk for traders seeking to profit from Nvidia's gyrations.\nNvidia's shares fell by nearly 7% in Wednesday's selloff, taking the leveraged ETFs down by as much as 13.5%. The S&P 500 index fell 2.3%, its worst loss since late 2022, as investors reacted to disappointing earnings from Tesla and Google. The chipmaker's shares were down about 3% on Thursday.\nMore turbulence could come next week, as investors await results from Apple, Microsoft Facebook-parent Meta and Amazon.com.\n\"Leverage goes both ways,\" said Todd Sohn, ETF analyst at Strategas Securities. \"It's great in a bull market, but when expectations are so high that any nerves cause a stock to unwind, the selloff is painful and quick.\"\nThe popularity of these ETFs is another example of how the eye-watering surge in Nvidia's shares has pushed investors to ramp up exposure to the stock, even as they increase the risks to their portfolios if the company's fortunes turn.\n\"Leveraged ETFs are for people who are comfortable with risk,\" Will Rhind, the CEO of GraniteShares, told Reuters in the latest episode of Inside ETFs.\n'VOLATILITY DRAG'\nWhile it's not yet clear whether investors were net buyers of leveraged ETFs tied to big tech stocks across the board during Wednesday's selloff, both GraniteShares and REX Shares, two of the asset managers that offer these products tied to Nvidia, said traders used the selloff as an opportunity to buy.\nThat would be consistent with investors' behavior over the past few weeks. The GraniteShares 2x Long Nvidia Daily ETF, which offers traders a daily return of double Nvidia's movements higher or lower, has attracted $1.06 billion of net inflows in the last month, during which Nvidia's shares had fallen by nearly 6% up to Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, the T-Rex 2x Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF has seen inflows on days when Nvidia's share price has fallen, according to flows data from the company, and has pulled in $75.7 million since the beginning of June.\nThe run-up in Nvidia's shares has also bolstered the leveraged ETFs' popularity with short sellers, who seek to profit from stock declines. Short interest in the GraniteShares ETF hovered around 15% of outstanding shares for the first half of July, compared to 1% in April, data from Vanda Research showed.\nThese ETFs can be risky for those who don't use them as day trading vehicles - which they are intended to be - and hold longer term, analysts said.\nDoing so can make investors vulnerable to so-called \"volatility drag,\" a phenomenon that over time can magnify gains or losses even beyond the leverage the fund provides. That could compound losses in a down market, because issuers reset the exposure to Nvidia's underlying stock price every day.\n\"In choppy markets, these leveraged products that have to buy the underlying stock when it goes up and sell when it goes down can get crushed,\" said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar.\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Paul Simao)\n"

The S&P 500 crossed 5,600 for the first time as expectations of an interest-rate cut in September climbed following comments this week by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\nPowell said in his second day of Congressional testimony that he was not ready to conclude that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2%, although he expressed \"some confidence of that\".\nThe Philadelphia semiconductor index jumped 2% to a record high after contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co posted strong quarterly revenue.\n\"TSMC's report supported the AI narrative, so that more than anything else today is a pretty important data point,\" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.\nMicron Technology rallied almost 4%, while Nvidia rose 2.3% to a three-week high.\nApple climbed 1.4% to a record high, lifting its stock market value to almost $3.6 trillion.\nOf the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, 10 rose, led by information technology, up 1.24%, followed by a 0.97% gain in materials.\nWith just a handful of large-cap stocks fueling Wall Street's rally this year, some investors worry about a potential selloff if those companies' earnings fail to meet high expectations.\nThe S&P 500 was up 0.69% at 5,615.50 points.\nThe Nasdaq gained 0.99% to 18,610.88 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.48% at 39,482.11 points.\nU.S. inflation data due this week include the Consumer Price Index on Thursday and the Producer Price Index report on Friday.\nExpectations of a 25-basis-point rate cut by September ticked up to 74% from around 70% on Tuesday and 45% a month ago, according to CME's FedWatch.\nSecond-quarter earnings season, which kicks off this week with major banks reporting on Friday, will test whether high-flying megacaps can justify expensive valuations and extend their strong runs.\nIntuit dropped 3% after the TurboTax owner said it plans to lay off about 10% of its workforce.\nGene-sequencing equipment maker Illumina jumped 6.5% on plans to acquire privately held Fluent BioSciences.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 2.3-to-one ratio.\nThe S&P 500 posted 27 new highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 54 new highs and 104 new lows.\n(Reporting by Lisa Mattackal and Ankika Biswas in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai and David Gregorio)\n"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose a more modest 0.2%.\nStocks extended their gains for the day as Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters a September cut \"could be on the table.\" While Powell noted the Fed has \"made no decisions about future meetings and that includes the September meeting,\" he also acknowledged that \"the broad sense of the committee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate.\"\nTech stocks were on the ascent again after taking a battering in recent days. Initial earnings reports from \"Magnificent Seven\" megacaps had stirred fears the AI boost would prove to be a bust, after falling short of high hopes.\nBut a swath of positive news is spurring a comeback for chip stocks, with AMD (AMD) shares getting a boost from an AI-driven earnings beat. Nvidia (NVDA) climbed over 12%, regaining ground lost in a steep drop on Tuesday in the halo of the results.\nAlso on Wednesday, Morgan Stanley noted that the recent 25% drawdown in Nvidia stock presented a \"good entry point,\" marking a sentiment shift in what's been an otherwise tough July for the AI leader.\nRead more: 32 charts that tell the story of markets and the economy right now\nIn commodities, oil jumped after the killing of Hamas' political leader in an airstrike stoked geopolitical tensions. Brent crude (BZ=F) futures, the global benchmark, rose more than 4% to top $81 a barrel. US benchmark West Intermediate crude futures (CL=F) climbed above $78 a barrel, also more than a 4% gain.\nAfter the bell, Meta (META) stock rose more than 4% after reporting second quarter earnings which topped Wall Street's expectations for both revenue and earnings per share.\nShares of Meta (META) quickly gained as much as 8% in after-hours trading on Wednesday as investors digested the tech giant's latest financial results, which topped Wall Street's expectations.\nMeta reported quarterly revenue of $39.07 billion, above consensus estimates for revenue of $38.34 billion, per Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, Meta's second quarter earnings per share of $5.16 beat expectations of $4.72 per share.\nMeta also reported an operating loss in its reality labs unit of $4.49 billion, a narrower loss than the $4.53 billion Wall Street had expected.\nAbout 10 minutes after the report, Meta's gains had diminished, with the stock sitting up just more than 3% in after-hours trade.\nIf Friday's July jobs report reveals the unemployment rate rose to 4.2% during the month, the Sahm Rule would be triggered.\nThe Sahm Rule, developed by economist Claudia Sahm, says that the US economy has entered a recession if the three-month average of the national unemployment rate has risen 0.5% or more from the previous 12-month low.\u00a0The rule has successfully predicted recessions 100% of the time since the early 1970s.\nBut as we recently noted, economists, including Sahm herself, are cautious about such an outcome being used to conclude a recession is imminent for the US economy given the current economic backdrop.\n\"The rise in the unemployment rate is not as ominous as it would normally seem,\" Sahm wrote in a July 26 post on Substack.\nOn Wednesday, when asked directly about if triggering the rule would be a concern, Fed Chair Jerome Powell clarified that the Sahm Rule is a \"statistical regularity,\" not an \"economic rule where it's telling you something must happen.\"\n\"We look at all the things we're seeing,\" Powell said. \"And what it looks like is a normalizing labor market.\"\nPowell further opined on the list of recession indicators that haven't proved accurate during the current economic cycle, noting that \"history doesn't repeat itself; it rhymes.\"\n\"Let's remember that this pandemic era has been one in which so many apparent rules have been flouted, like the inverted yield curve, for starters,\" Powell said. \"So many perceived pieces of wisdom just haven't worked.\"\nPowell pointed to the unique situation of inflation starting from the pandemic lockdown, where supply was constrained while demand spiked, as a reason the current economic situation is different than the past.\n\"The whole situation is not the same as many of the other prior inflation [spikes] or downturns that we've seen or business cycles that we've seen,\" Powell said. \"So we're having to learn to be very careful about the judgments that we make.\"\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted a welcome shift in inflation data over the past few months during his press conference on Wednesday.\n\"This is a broader disinflation,\" Powell said.\nHe added that beyond just goods disinflation, which was seen during 2023, the data is now showing price declines in non-housing services and housing services.\n\"I would say the quality of this is higher and it's good,\" Powell said. \"But so far it's only a quarter. So I think ... we need to have more confidence that we're on a good path down to 2%. But as I mentioned, our confidence is growing because we've been getting good data.\"\nThis is a point that several economists made to Yahoo Finance in the latest edition of our Chartbook.\n\"The drop in primary rents and owners' equivalent rents in the June CPI data is a 'game changer' and should meaningfully boost Fed officials' confidence that inflation remains on a trajectory back to its 2% target,\" Deutsche Bank senior US economist Brett Ryan told Yahoo Finance. \"To be sure, the Fed will likely want to see a couple more prints to confirm the downshift, but historically, rents have been fairly sticky \u2014 i.e., when you have a shift in either direction from [a] prior trend, it tends to persist.\"\nGold (GC=F) futures touched a new intraday high of $2,481.40 per ounce as Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated a rate cut could come as soon as the September policy meeting.\nThe precious metal was already on the rise Wednesday amid heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. A tick lower in the US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) also helped lift gold prices.\nPowell's comments on Wednesday afternoon indicated to investors that rates will be coming down. A lower interest rate environment makes it more attractive for investors to buy gold, as the precious metal doesn't produce an annual yield.\nStocks drifted higher amid Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference in which he noted a September rate cut is \"on the table.\"\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose by 2% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared about 3.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose a more modest 1%.\nMeanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index rose about 0.8%.\nMarkets are widely expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its September meeting.\nBut when asked specifically if the market's expectations are accurate, Powell declined to commit to a September cut.\n\"We have made no decisions about future meetings and that includes the September meeting,\" Powell said. \"The broad sense of the committee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate.\"\nPowell said \"more\" good inflation data remains the key for the Fed.\nIn a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady but hinted that it is drawing nearer to a rate cut as it makes more progress toward its goal of getting inflation down.\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: \nThe central bank voted to keep its benchmark interest rate in a range of 5.25%-5.50%, a 23-year high. The decision was unanimous.\nThe fed funds rate has been in this range since last July as part of the Fed\u2019s aggressive campaign to tamp down inflation that ballooned during the pandemic.\nBut Fed officials hinted they are getting closer to the confidence needed to lower rates as inflation continues to cool and the job market slows, making a cut at its next meeting on Sept. 17-18 increasingly likely.\n\u201cIn recent months there has been some further progress towards the Committee\u2019s 2% inflation objective,\u201d officials said in their policy statement. It was a change from the \"modest further progress\" cited in the prior statement at the Fed's last meeting.\nThey also noted that the risks to both sides of their dual mandate \u2014 inflation and full employment \u2014 \u201ccontinue to move into better balance\u201d \u2014 a change from \u201cmoved toward better balance.\u201d\n\u201cThe outlook is uncertain and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate,\u201d the statement read.\nStocks slid slightly from the high-water mark of Wednesday's trading action as the Federal Reserve's latest policy decision loomed at 2 p.m.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose by 1.4% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared more than 2.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose a more modest 0.5%.\nMeanwhile, in the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield dropped about 3 basis points to 4.11%, its lowest level since March.\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday while opening the door to a September cut if inflation continues to show progress.\nInvestors will be watching for clues about the path forward in a post-meeting statement from Fed officials and a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\nThe pay gap between job stayers and job changers narrowed in July in the latest sign that the US labor market is cooling.\nNew data from ADP released Wednesday showed that the median year-over-year pay increase for job switchers fell to 7.2% in July, down from the 7.7% increase seen in June. Meanwhile, pay for workers who stay in the same job rose 4.8%, its slowest rate of increase since July 2021.\nThe gap between the two numbers is slimming, indicating the benefits workers saw from leaving their jobs during the post-lockdown hiring boom continue to erode.\n\"The payoff from switching jobs has dropped tremendously,\" ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said on a call with reporters Wednesday morning.\nWhile it may be a less attractive outcome for workers, Richardson added the easing in wage growth is a welcome sign for the Federal Reserve in its fight against inflation.\n\"Wages and pay are the bridge from the labor market to the inflation data, and we are certain, after three years of looking at these numbers, that if inflation picks up \u2014 and no one thinks that's likely right now \u2014 it won't be because of labor,\" Richardson said. \"We're seeing continued steady declines in wage growth that fits with the overall inflation picture also cooling, along with the labor market.\"\nOil surged on Wednesday amid concerns of a widening war in the Middle East following the assassination of a Hamas leader in Iran.\nWest Texas Intermediate (CL=F) jumped more than 3% just north of $76 per barrel. Brent (BZ=F) the international benchmark price, gained more than 2% to hover above $80 per barrel.\nThe jump came after Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran, flaring ongoing tensions and raising concerns over the risk of a supply disruption in the region. Iran produces roughly 3 million barrels of oil a day.\n\u201cI think over the near-term prices continue to be stuck in a range with Brent crude oil around $80 per barrel and WTI a few dollars less,\u201d Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.\nPrices were also supported by the latest US government data showing a fifth straight week of inventory declines.\nOPEC+ will hold an online meeting on Thursday. Traders are assessing whether the oil alliance led by Saudi Arabia will move forward with previously announced plans to unwind some of its voluntary cuts starting in October.\n\u201cIf OPEC meets tomorrow and continues to look toward rereleasing crude from 4Q 2024 on, we'll see a sharp drop in the last 120 days of the year,\u201d OPIS global head of energy analysis Tom Kloza told Yahoo Finance.\nStocks are roaring on Wednesday, but a recent hot trade on Wall Street isn't fully a part of the party.\nThe small-cap Russell 2000 index (^RUT), which has rallied nearly 10% in the past month as investors have grown more optimistic about Fed rate cuts, is up a more modest 0.8% on Wednesday.\nThis compares to the roughly 1.6% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and a 2.5% surge in the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC).\nThe rally in large-cap tech is largely attributable to renewed faith in the AI trade, and comes counter recent market action in which the Russell 2000's year-to-date gains had nearly caught up to the Nasdaq 100's.\nMovement in small caps will be particularly in focus after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's press conference Wednesday afternoon as investors will look to see if a dovish Powell furthers the rotation toward areas outside of tech.\nNvidia (NVDA) stock rallied more than 10% on Wednesday following better than expected guidance from peer AMD (AMD) and a bullish call from analysts at Morgan Stanley following a more than 20% drop in the stock.\nAMD's quarterly results out late Tuesday quelled some concerns that AI trade may have run its course as investors rotated out of Big Tech over the past month, as the company beat expectations on the top and bottom line and posted a better-than-expected outlook for the third quarter.\nAMD stock rose as much as 6% in early trading.\nChip peers including Broadcom (AVGO), Micron (MU), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), ASML (ASML), and Super Micro (SMCI) were also rallying on Wednesday.\nNvidia stock was also boosted on Wednesday by a note out from Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore, who moved the stock to a 'Top Pick' after a recent pullback from record highs reached in June.\nThe firm wrote the roughly 25% in Nvidia stock \"selloff presents a good entry point as we continue to hear strong data points short term and long term, with overblown competitive concerns.\"\nRead more here. \nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) is up more than 2.4% on Wednesday and pacing for its best day since February.\nThe revival in tech stocks began late Tuesday night after chip giant AMD (AMD) surprised Wall Street to the upside with its second quarter earnings showing stronger-than-expected revenue, largely driven by the company's AI efforts. Shares in AMD rose more than 7% in early trade Wednesday.\nThe report sparked a rally among chip stocks. The PHLX Semiconductor index (^SOX) rose more than 5%. The largest chip stock, Nvidia, rallied more than 10% following the report as Morgan Stanley released fresh research noting the recent 25% drawdown in the stock presents \"a good entry point,\" and listed the stock is a \"top pick.\"\nRising inventory is shifting the housing market in buyers' favor.\nPending home sales, a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, rose 4.8% in June from the month prior, according to the National Association of Realtors. Economists polled by Bloomberg had expected a 1.5% monthly increase.\n\u201cThe rise in housing inventory is beginning to lead to more contract signings,\u201d NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a press statement. \u201cMultiple offers are less intense, and buyers are in a more favorable position.\u201d\nThe jump in buyer activity suggests that more is likely to follow.\n\u201cEven more inventory is expected to come onto the housing market in the upcoming months ahead of the normal, seasonal declines in the winter,\u201d added Yun. \u201cThe Northeast\u2019s small gain in contract signings is due to the ongoing housing shortage situation in that region, leading to stronger home price gains. It is a good time to list.\u201d\nMortgage rates have been a point of distress for homeowners to sell, as many were locked in at ultra-low rate during the pandemic. But rates have come down since they topped 7% earlier this summer.\nHowever, some buyers are still waiting on the sidelines as home prices reach new highs. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 2% from the prior week on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Wednesday.\n\u201cBorrowers may be waiting for signs that mortgage rates will drift lower as the Federal Reserve begins to cut short-term rates,\u201d Mike Fratantoni, MBA's SVP and chief economist, wrote in a statement.\nUS stocks rallied on Wednesday amid a tech revival that sent the Nasdaq surging as investors prepared for the Federal Reserve's decision on whether to cut interest rates.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose by 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared more than 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 0.1%.\nTech stocks are in the ascent again after taking a battering in recent days. The first earnings from \"Magnificent Seven\" megacaps stirred fears the AI boost would prove a bust after falling short of high hopes.\nA swathe of positive news is spurring a premarket comeback for chip stocks, with AMD (AMD) shares getting a boost from an AI-driven earnings beat.\nNvidia (NVDA) climbed over 7%, regaining ground lost in a steep drop on Tuesday, in the halo of the results. Also, on Wednesday, Morgan Stanley noted that the recent 25% drawdown in Nvidia stock presented a \"good entry point,\" marking a sentiment shift in what's been an otherwise tough July for the AI leader.\nThe US economy added fewer private payroll jobs than expected in July.\nThe latest data from ADP showed 122,000 private payroll jobs were added in July, falling short of consensus expectations for 150,000 additions.\nAlso out Wednesday morning, ADP's latest pay insights showed that the median year-over-year pay increase for job switchers fell to 7.2% in July, down from 7.7% in June. Pay gains for job stayers grew at a 4.8% pace in July, its lowest late in about three years, per ADP's chief economist Nela Richardson.\nI would be paying attention to how CEOs and CFOs discuss the outlook for taxes on their earnings calls for the balance of the year.\nTaxes play an integral part in if companies undertake a project, a deal or more hiring. Best believe management teams and boards are running through scenarios if the Trump tax cuts aren't extended in 2025.\nHere's Procter & Gamble (PG) chair and CEO Jon Moeller to me on Yahoo Finance yesterday on the 2017 Trump tax cuts:\nOn their impact: The tax cuts have been \"incredibly impactful. And you know, that element of the dialogue is going to increase as we get through the election and start talking about 2025 when some of the tax provisions that were passed in 2017 sunset. But if you just look at our investment in the US pre- and post- the 2017 act, it's up significantly, our employment is up significantly, and, importantly, our taxes \u2014 the taxes we're paying to the US government \u2014 are up significantly. So it's really led to significant economic activity in this country.\"\nOn if the tax cuts aren't extended: \"It will certainly have an impact. Every decision that we make is based on the present value of discounted cash flow. And that's on an after-tax basis. And so it begins favoring on a comparative basis, other locations for investment. So yes, it will have an impact.\"\nShares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are back in the good graces of Wall Street this morning after earnings last night, with the stock up 9% in the premarket.\nI think the Street is locking in on AMD's upwardly revised guidance on demand for its new AI chip.\nA key call-out by Citi analyst Chris Danely:\nMicrosoft (MSFT) shares are rallying back a bit in the premarket after initially dropping 6% last night following earnings, in part because of a surprise slowdown in Azure growth. As of this writing, shares are down about 3%.\nThe company guided to another quarter of slower Azure growth, but then things improving over the next 12 months.\nGood point by Guggenheim analyst John Difucci on this rosy Azure outlook:\nStarbucks (SBUX) shares are up 3% pre-market post a horrendous quarter last night.\nTo illustrate how horrendous:\nSo why the stock pop?\nWell, Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan hopped on his earnings call and shared a bunch of obscure stats suggesting sales and margin trends would improve in a few quarters. He also teased a potential cost-savings action in China, likely through inking a joint venture deal.\nBe careful chasing any Starbucks enthusiasm. This is a management team with a credibility problem with investors, and is dealing with deeply rooted issues such as unions and poor value perception among customers. The end-game on the new battle with activist Elliott Management is also wildly unknown.\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the \"it\" stock of the year, and that's an understatement. It's up 150% this year, crushing the broader market, and that catapulted it to the very top spot as the largest public company by market cap. It's since dropped down to third place behind leaders Microsoft and Apple, and top status may continue to change hands.\nA stock's market cap is the total value of all of its shares. It's calculated by multiplying share price by the number of shares outstanding. Nvidia stock trades at about $123 as of this writing and has 24.6 billion shares outstanding, giving it a total market cap of $3 trillion.\nMarket cap doesn't tell investors much about a stock, but it can still be informative. The companies with the highest market caps are doing well and have investor confidence. They're winning companies. They're well-established leaders, and there's little risk to their businesses.\nAt the same time, they may not grow as fast as smaller companies that have yet to be discovered. But does that mean they tend to underperform the market?\nThe five companies with the highest market caps right now, with the exception of Apple, have all been beating the market this year. The others include Amazon and Alphabet.\nMSFT Total Return Level data by YCharts\nThat's testament to the concept that winners keep on winning. These are all top companies that have a proven track record and are keeping it up.\nNvidia has garnered an incredible amount of attention due to its generative artificial intelligence (AI) chips. There's enormous demand for all kinds of generative AI applications, and Nvidia is the leading producer of chips that can handle the data loads for these kinds of applications.\nStock price movements aren't always logical, but broadly, share price increases as a company performs well. There are all kinds of metrics that measure performance: revenue growth, margins, profitability, and return on equity are a few examples. Nvidia has been reporting stunning growth since the beginning of the generative AI craze, driving a huge price increase.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\nNvidia stock also benefited from excitement around its recent 10-for-1 stock split, which fueled more interest in the stock and still more increases. It briefly topped the market cap charts right after the split, but since that wasn't driven by any specific company performance metric, it fell back into third place.\nPart of that fall was due to valuation concerns. It's getting quite expensive; even after the pullback, Nvidia stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 72. That's a well-deserved premium valuation, but even the best companies can't support an earnings multiple that outweighs its worth. Microsoft, by comparison, trades at a P/E of about 39.\nDoes it make sense for Nvidia to be the most valuable company in the world? It doesn't take in nearly the same amount of sales as Amazon or profit as Apple. But neither does Microsoft. Nvidia is growing faster than all of the other top five market cap companies, though, and the market is pricing that into its valuation.\nIf Nvidia continues to provide the infrastructure for applications that drive global business, it will likely stay near the top of the market cap list for the foreseeable future. But it may not be able to keep up this kind of growth forever, and investors should be prepared for a pullback.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "US progressive groups and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren pressed the Department of Justice to investigate Nvidia (NVDA) over competition concerns, citing the company's dominance of the market for the chips driving the artificial-intelligence boom.\nDemand Progress and nine other groups wrote a letter this week urging Department of Justice antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter to probe business practices at Nvidia, whose market value hit $3 trillion this summer on demand for chips able to run the complex models behind generative AI.\nThe groups, which oppose monopolies and promote government oversight of tech companies, among other issues, took aim at Nvidia's bundling of software and hardware, a practice that French antitrust enforcers have flagged as they prepare to bring charges.\n\"This aggressively proprietary approach, which is strongly contrary to industry norms about collaboration and interoperability, acts to lock in customers and stifles innovation,\" the groups wrote.\nIn June, Reuters reported a deal was reached among US regulators that directs the Justice Department to oversee potential antitrust probes into Nvidia, while the Federal Trade Commission is looking at Microsoft and OpenAI.\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said the company spent billions of dollars developing AI-capable computing technology before demand existed, and is \"committed to opening new markets and growth opportunities for our partner ecosystem.\"\n\"Regulators need not be concerned, as we scrupulously adhere to all laws and ensure that NVIDIA is openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise,\" the spokesperson said. \"We'll continue to support aspiring innovators in every industry and market and are happy to provide any information regulators need.\"\nNvidia has roughly 80% of the AI chip market, including the custom AI processors made by cloud computing companies like Google, (GOOG) Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN). The chips made by the cloud giants are not available for sale themselves but typically rented through each platform.\nExcluding the cloud providers' chips, Nvidia achieved nearly 100% market share. That domination helps the company report gross margins between 70% and 80%.\nWarren, a US senator from Massachusetts, expressed concerns about Nvidia's control of the market in a statement to Reuters.\n\"Allowing a single company to effectively be the gatekeeper for the world's AI future is dangerous and poses dire economic risks. The DOJ is right to investigate Nvidia's anticompetitive practices,\" she said.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment.\nKanter said in an interview on CNBC on Friday, without discussing Nvidia specifically, that antitrust enforcers are concerned about areas where there are bottlenecks that companies could take advantage of to exclude rivals.\n\"We want a world where, one, there is room for investment and development and growth into new rivals and technologies,\" he said.\nLast year, Reuters reported that investments in the semiconductor industry were down considerably in the face of Nvidia's overwhelming market share.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York and Max Cherney in San Franciso; Editing by Matthew Lewis)\n"

The company's share price was up 1.1% as of 2:10 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nThe stock opened today's daily trading session down as much as 7% as concerns about geopolitical risk factors and earnings misses for Alphabet and Tesla continued to drag on the stock. But Nvidia shareholders got some welcome good news in the form of better-than-expected U.S. economic data, and the artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price has rebounded.\nAccording to the Department of Commerce, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown 2.8% year over year in the second quarter. That growth came in far better than the average economist target for growth of 1.9%. Prior to the new data, Nvidia stock looked poised for another day of big sell-offs.\nThe stronger-than-expected economic data has boosted hopes that the economy may be able to achieve a soft landing -- avoiding a recession while also managing to get inflation under control. If so, that would be very good news for Nvidia and other growth stocks.\nNvidia stock has seen volatile trading lately, and it sits 15% below the valuation high that it reached in June. The company's share price is still up roughly 133%, and signs point to demand for its hardware and services remaining quite strong.\nWith Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms all scheduled to report quarterly results over the next week, there's a good chance that Nvidia stock will see some significant movements in conjunction with the quality of big-tech earnings. Finally, Nvidia will be the last member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" to report quarterly results this earnings season and is scheduled to publish its results after the market closes on Aug. 28.\nNvidia's last update guided for revenue of roughly $28 billion in the quarter -- good for growth of 107% year over year.

        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Although stock-split euphoria has taken hold in 2024, there isn't a bigger trend on Wall Street than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe loose definition of AI involves the use of software and systems in place of humans for specified tasks. What gives this technology such broad-reaching potential spanning virtually every sector and industry of the global economy is the ability for AI-driven software and systems to learn without human intervention. Becoming more proficient at existing tasks over time, perhaps even learning new skills, gives AI the potential to add an estimated $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to analysts at PwC.\nNo company has benefited more directly from this game-changing innovation than semiconductor colossus Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nSince 2023 began, Nvidia's stock has gained more than $2.4 trillion in market value, or 668% on a percentage basis, as of the closing bell on July 25, 2024. Nvidia also completed a 10-for-1 stock split in June to make its shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors.\nThis historic scaling of Nvidia's valuation has everything to do with its graphics processing units (GPUs) being the preferred choice by businesses operating AI-driven data centers. Though estimates vary, the analysts at TechInsights pegged Nvidia as being responsible for all but 90,000 of the 3.85 million GPUs shipped for use in data centers last year.\nTo build on this point, Wall Street's AI darling isn't anywhere close to meeting enterprise demand for its chips. When demand for a good or service handily outweighs its supply, it's normal for the price of said good or service to rise. Nvidia's phenomenal pricing power helped lift its adjusted gross margin by close to 14 percentage points over a period of five quarters (ended April 28).\nThere's also a lot of excitement surrounding Nvidia's next-generation data center hardware. The company's Blackwell platform, which accelerates computing in a half-dozen key areas, including generative AI solutions, is expected to be rolled out to customers later this year. By 2026, the Rubin GPU architecture, slated to run on a brand-new processor (\"Vera\"), should hit the market. In other words, Nvidia's lineup suggests it can retain its competitive edge, at least in terms of compute capabilities.\nDespite this textbook expansion for Nvidia, shares of the company have recently hit the skids.\nWhen the closing bell tolled on July 25, Nvidia's stock clocked in at $112.28 per share. While this is, as noted, a 668% gain from where it was on Jan. 1, 2023, shares are down 20.2% from the $140.76 all-time intra-day high reached on June 20. In other words, Nvidia's stock is in a full-blown correction.\nAlthough there isn't a predictive tool or metric that can forecast where Nvidia's stock will find its bottom with 100% accuracy, 25 years' worth of history does offer clear clues of what might await this AI leader in the months and quarters to come.\nOver the last quarter of a century, we've witnessed no shortage of buzzy technologies and trends come and go. While some of these innovations and trends have gone on to make investors considerably richer over the long run, one of the key consistencies of next-big-thing innovations is the early-stage overestimation of their adoption and utility by the investing community.\nWhile it's easy to be swept away by grandiose addressable market figures (e.g., AI adding $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030), it's important to recognize that all new technologies and trends need time to mature. Though there's no way to know ahead of time how long it'll take for an innovation to mature, the simple fact that most businesses lack a clear game plan with their AI investments suggests we're witnessing the next in a long line of bubbles.\nMore specifically, 25 years of next-big-thing innovations have shown that market leaders within these trends tend to be hit the hardest:\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, leading e-commerce player Amazon and networking giant Cisco Systems each lost in the neighborhood of 90% of their value on a peak-to-trough basis.\nAlthough genome decoding stocks like Celera and Human Genome Sciences are no longer around -- they were both acquired many years back -- both companies followed in Amazon's and Cisco's footsteps and shed most of their value after the euphoria surrounding genome decoding faded.\nWhereas e-commerce and networking have been long-term winning investments, the excitement surrounding 3D printing has evaporated.\u00a0Following their peak, both\u00a03D Systems\u00a0and\u00a0Stratasys lost well over 90% of their respective value.\nThough cannabis isn't a new technology, its legalization in Canada was viewed as a generational moneymaking opportunity. Unfortunately, Canadian licensed producer Canopy Growth eventually plunged 99% from its peak valuation.\nCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global has served as the stock-based face of the crypto revolution. When the buzz surrounding crypto and blockchain technology ebbed, shares of the company plummeted by close to 90%.\nMeta Platforms spearheaded the rise of the metaverse -- the virtual 3D environment where people can interact with each other and create an entirely new ecosystem. However, with this technology needing time to mature, Meta's stock ultimately fell by around 80% before rebounding to new highs.\nBased on what we've witnessed from next-big-thing innovations and trends over the last 25 years, market leaders tend to shed 80% or more of their peak market value once the bubble bursts.\nThe good news for Nvidia is that it had multiple well-established sales channels before artificial intelligence became its primary growth driver. These channels include its GPUs used for gaming and cryptocurrency mining, as well as its professional visualization and automotive/robotics solutions. If the AI bubble were to burst, just like every other next-big-thing trend over the prior 30 years, Nvidia would likely find more downside support than many of the pummeled market leaders that came before it.\nNevertheless, there's a precedent that market-leading stocks plummet once the realization sets in that a buzzy technology needs time to mature. At the very least, history points to Nvidia losing a minimum of half its value on a peak-to-trough basis. This would bring its share price down to $70 and imply significant downside.\nBut if Nvidia isn't the exception to the rule, history suggests it could plummet below a $1 trillion market cap in the years to come.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is known as a growth stock, full stop. There's good reason for that, as its artificial intelligence (AI) chips and platforms are currently dominating a quickly growing market. So why is anyone talking about Nvidia as a dividend-paying stock?\nIt's because unlike many other high-growth tech companies, Nvidia has been paying a dividend since 2014. Granted, the dividend over that decade didn't contribute much to shareholder returns. After all, Nvidia pays a quarterly dividend of just $0.01 per share. That equates to an annual yield of only 0.03% at its recent share price of about $119.\nBut investors should pay attention to it anyway. Management thinks enough of that small dividend to raise it by 150% to coincide with Nvidia's recent 10-for-1 stock split. While that huge dividend boost was mainly done for mechanical reasons to reflect the new, lower price per share resulting from the stock split, it also did double the small yield, too.\nThat yield could grow to become a meaningful part of a long-term investment in Nvidia. That's because Nvidia's success has juiced its earnings. Compare that current $0.04 annual dividend payment to Nvidia's earnings per share of $17.10 over the last four quarters. That calculates to an almost negligible payout ratio of 0.2%.\nThat means the company can significantly ramp up that payout to shareholders. While that shouldn't be the focus in the near term, Nvidia already had $21.7 billion in cash and equivalents net of long- and short-term debt as of April 28.\nThe company reports its next financial update on Aug. 28. That report will likely show Nvidia is still squarely in growth mode. But long-term investors should still keep an eye on the ways management seeks to return its strong earnings to shareholders. And that could include a growing dividend down the road.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Fanny Potkin and Heekyong Yang\nSINGAPORE/SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics' fourth-generation high bandwidth memory or HBM3 chips have been cleared by Nvidia for use in its processors for the first time, three people briefed on the matter said.\nBut it is somewhat of a muted greenlight as Samsung's HBM3 chips will, for now, only be used in a less sophisticated Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU), the H20, which has been developed for the Chinese market in compliance with U.S. export controls, the people said.\nIt was not immediately clear if Nvidia would use Samsung's HBM3 chips in its other AI processors or if the chips would have to pass additional tests before that could happen, they added.\nSamsung has also yet to meet Nvidia's standards for fifth-generation HBM3E chips and testing of those chips is continuing, the people added, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media.\nNvidia and Samsung declined to comment.\nHBM is a type of dynamic random access memory or DRAM standard first produced in 2013 in which chips are vertically stacked to save space and reduce power consumption. A key component of GPUs for artificial intelligence, it helps process massive amounts of data produced by complex applications.\nNvidia's approval of Samsung's HBM3 chips comes amid soaring demand for sophisticated GPUs created by the generative AI boom that Nvidia and other makers of AI chipsets are struggling to meet.\nThere are only three main manufacturers of HBM - SK Hynix, Micron and Samsung - and with HBM3 also in short supply, Nvidia is keen to see Samsung clear its standards so that it can diversify its supplier base.\nNvidia's need to have more access to HBM3 is also set to grow as SK Hynix - the clear leader in the field - plans to increase its HBM3E production and make less HBM3, two of the sources said.\nSK Hynix declined to comment.\nSamsung, the world's largest maker of memory chips, has been seeking to pass Nvidia's tests for both HBM3 and HBM3E since last year but has struggled due to heat and power consumption issues, Reuters reported in May, citing sources.\nSamsung said after the publication of the Reuters article in May that claims of failing Nvidia's tests due to heat and power consumption problems were untrue.\nH20\nSamsung could begin supplying HBM3 for Nvidia's H20 processor as early as August, according to two of the sources.\nThe H20 is the most advanced of three GPUs Nvidia has tailored for the China market after the U.S. tightened export restrictions in 2023, aiming to impede supercomputing and AI breakthroughs that could benefit the Chinese military.\nIn accordance with U.S. sanctions, the H20's computing power has been significantly capped compared to the version sold in non-China markets, the H100.\nThe H20 initially got off to a weak start when deliveries began this year and the U.S. firm priced it below a rival chip from Chinese tech giant Huawei, Reuters reported in May.\nBut sales are now growing rapidly, separate sources have said.\nIn contrast to Samsung, SK Hynix is the main supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia and has been supplying HBM3 since June 2022. It also began supplying HBM3E in late March to a customer it declined to identify. Shipments went to Nvidia, sources have said.\nMicron has also said it will supply Nvidia with HBM3E.\n(Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore and Heekyong Yang in Seoul; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n"

        "Title": "Could Investing in AMD Now Be Like Investing in Nvidia in 2023?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the clear-cut winner in the artificial intelligence (AI) graphics processing unit (GPU) race. While AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) has competing products, it hasn't seen anywhere near the success of Nvidia. However, some recent developments have potentially shifted the landscape for AMD.\nIf given the opportunity, every investor would travel back to the start of 2023 and invest in Nvidia. But could investing in AMD right now be nearly the same thing?\nNvidia's GPU popularity is partly due to its proprietary CUDA software. GPUs are useful in AI because they can process many calculations in parallel, but this isn't a unique feature for Nvidia GPUs. CUDA allows developers to optimize and deploy applications on GPU systems, which is critical for optimizing their use.\nAMD has a product called ROCm that competes against CUDA, but it's not nearly as good. A few benchmark tests of GPUs running ROCm versus CUDA software show significant underperformance, which isn't something companies spending millions of dollars on GPUs are willing to deal with. Customers forking over all of this money want the best possible product, so they almost exclusively use Nvidia for its GPUs and software.\nHowever, there may be an alternative that allows CUDA to be run on Nvidia GPUs.\nAn open-source program called ZLUDA was created to run CUDA on AMD GPUs and would allow customers to field more AMD GPUs using a simple drop-in program. However, few companies would likely deploy this, as there could be unforeseen consequences for using unsupported software. When the stakes are in the millions of dollars, most companies will likely just keep with the status quo and stick with Nvidia.\nUnless AMD makes serious upgrades to its software, it will likely not be able to compete with Nvidia in the data center GPU market.\nBut could it still be worth some of your investment dollars?\nWhile Nvidia has been tripling its revenue over the past few quarters, AMD has been struggling. In the first quarter, AMD's revenue only rose 2% year over year. While its data center revenue was strong at $2.3 billion, growing at an 80% year-over-year pace, its gaming and embedded process segments tumbled 48% and 46% year over year, respectively.\nThat's an abysmal performance from an investing perspective, and it makes sense that investors have mostly stuck to Nvidia rather than AMD. For the rest of 2024, Wall Street analysts project 13% revenue growth. In 2025, that ramps up to 28% growth.\nBoth projections are well behind Nvidia's predicted revenue growth, but this can all be forgiven if AMD can be bought at a substantially cheaper price. But it can't.\nRight now, AMD and Nvidia are trading for nearly the same forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\nSo why would you invest in AMD over Nvidia right now? I have no clue.\nWith AMD, you're betting that things will get better, and it will somehow level the playing field with Nvidia. With Nvidia, you're betting that a company that is already dominating the market will continue to do so. Normally, in these situations, the competitor that is behind trades at a discount to the winner because a turnaround isn't as certain. That's not the case here, which is why Nvidia makes a far better investment than AMD unless something substantial changes.\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 11 Biggest AI and Tech Stock Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades in July So Far.\u00a0Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nAs soon as the latest softer-than-expected inflation data numbers were out, investors began to take profits from major tech stocks and pour money into small-cap companies amid hopes of rate cuts. However, some were quick to call the latest decline in tech stocks the end of the AI-fueled rally that has pushed stock valuations to eye-popping levels. But there are some Wall Street analysts who believe this is just a short-term trend and large tech and AI stocks have a lot of room to grow. Samantha McLemore, CIO of Patient Capital, said while talking to CNBC that the \u201cbull market continues and the path of least resistance is higher.\u201d\nThe analyst said that she has been in the market for a long time and investors have been worrying about the end of the bull market since 2009, while the S&P 500 has grown over 1000% (17% per year) since then.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any end to the bull market. We do think there\u2019s a good chance we see a rotation and small caps, the laggards, do much better in the second half of the year as the Fed starts to cut rates.\u201d\nSome analysts believe the latest decline in tech stocks is yet another opportunity for long-term investors to pile into AI stocks for gains. In this backdrop, we decided to take a look at the top AI stock upgrades and downgrades this month. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) rapid run and soaring valuation have started to make some circles on Wall Street uneasy. New Street Research recently downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy and set the stock\u2019s price target at $135.\n\u201cWe downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.\u201d New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu said.\nNYU professor and valuation guru Aswath Damodoran has also been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has \u201cno idea what I\u2019m talking about\u201d or it\u2019s the market that just does not understand.\nAswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the \u201cdriving seat\u201d of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won\u2019t be as easy as the market assumes.\nRecently, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have gained about 206% over the past year.\nRecently, Barclays Tom O\u2019Malley gave bullish comments on the stock, with a $145 price target and an Overweight rating. The analyst pointed to a potential $25 billion opportunity from countries building up their AI capabilities. O\u2019Malley expects NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings at $3.62 per share in fiscal 2026, while Wall Street analysts on average have a $3.55 per share estimate for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings for 2026.\nNVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest product announcements and its plans revealed at the Computex 2024 show that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts like NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and think its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will start shipping H200 in the second half of this year. At its GTC conference NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed three accelerators \u2013 B200, GB200 and GB200 NVL72. All of these products provide growth catalysts for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares and justify its P/E multiple of 71, given NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth expectation of over 100% this year and 32% next year. Based on 2026 EPS estimate set by Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 35.74, which makes the stock\u2019s valuation attractive given the growth catalysts it has.\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming. PCs, data centers, virtual reality and high- performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put, Nvidia\u2019s computational power is a critical enabler of Al and therefore critical to Al adoption, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported solid fiscal fourth quarter results above analyst expectations, driven by strong demand from data centers. Further, large cloud service providers contributed over 50% of revenue and inference tasks-using trained Al models on new data-accounted for over 40% of data center revenue. Management also raised their fiscal first quarter guidance noting that demand is estimated to outstrip supply over the next year. We continue to believe the company is well positioned to potentially benefit from the growing Al data center workloads, which are driving demand for the increased interconnections and fully accelerated software stacks, thereby enabling leading application performance and fast result times.\u201d\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 11 Biggest AI and Tech Stock Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades in July So Far. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Every major new technology produces a big winner that especially stands out. With the PC, I'd go with Microsoft. It's harder to pick just one winner with the internet, but Google parent Alphabet and Amazon would both be great picks.\nAny of these three companies are also contenders to be the big winner with generative AI. However, the hands-down favorite right now has to be Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The AI stock skyrocketed 150% in the first half of 2024. Here's why it could go even higher.\nIn March, Nvidia introduced its new Blackwell platform. The company claimed that Blackwell will \"power a new era of computing.\" Is that merely hype? I don't think so.\nBlackwell enables customers to build and deploy large language models (LLMs) with 1 trillion or more parameters at up to 25 times less cost and energy consumption than Nvidia's Hopper architecture. It can also support up to four times faster training of LLMs and 30 times faster inference. This new platform isn't limited to generative AI, though. Its other uses include engineering simulation, electronic design automation, quantum computing, and more.\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said in the company's second-quarter earnings call on May 29 that demand for Blackwell \"is well ahead of supply.\" She added that this dynamic could extend \"well into next year.\"\nIn June, CEO Jensen Huang told shareholders, \"The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history.\" Is this statement an exaggeration? Probably not the first part of it. We'll have to wait and see about the second part.\nA \"who's who\" of the AI world has already lined up to order Blackwell chips. The list includes cloud service leaders Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle. It features AI innovators OpenAI, Tesla, and Elon Musk's XAi. Nvidia has also announced several top electric vehicle companies will use its new Drive Thor self-driving car technology based on Blackwell architecture, including BYD and XPeng.\nBefore we assume that Blackwell will be a slam-dunk catalyst that pushes Nvidia stock higher, let's address a few potential obstacles. Huang singled out one issue during the recent annual shareholder's meeting: competition.\nNvidia's success is unquestionably attracting attention from rivals. Big chipmakers including AMD and Intel hope to take away some of Nvidia's market share. Major cloud service providers including Amazon and Google offer their own AI chips. But Huang isn't worried. He believes the lower total cost of ownership (TCO) of Nvidia's chips will keep rivals at bay.\nAnother persistent concern about Nvidia is its valuation. One analyst recently downgraded the stock largely because of its premium valuation. However, if Blackwell achieves the level of success Huang predicts (or anywhere close to it), Nvidia stock could be undervalued.\nAn economic downturn would likely dampen Nvidia's growth. The good news, though, is there aren't any dark clouds in sight on that front. The U.S. appears to have avoided the recession many economists predicted in the not-so-distant past.\nI think there's one other factor that's key to Nvidia continuing its strong momentum. The company's speed in innovation could keep the growth story going for years to come.\nHuang noted in Nvidia's Q2 call that the company is now in \"a one-year rhythm\" of rolling out new technology. The reality is Nvidia's rivals can't keep up with it right now. If Nvidia can regularly roll out new chips that lower the TCO while delivering greater performance, the high-flying stock is likely to soar much higher over the next several years.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Stefon Walters, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been on a remarkable run over the past year and a half. Not only is its stock up over 670% since the beginning of 2023, but its revenue in its most recent quarter (ended April 28) grew an impressive 262% year over year.\nNvidia has artificial intelligence (AI) mania to thank for its recent successes. It became the go-to option for its state-of-the-art graphic processing units (GPUs) that power many of the world's data centers (more on that to come). Both investors and tech customers have been flocking to Nvidia to take advantage of the newfound AI momentum.\nThat said, Nvidia's recent stock price growth made the stock absurdly expensive (66 P/E ratio), leaving it more susceptible to a correction if it underdelivers in the slightest. That's why the following two stocks may be better options right now for investors interested in the tech sector.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing,\u00a0(NYSE: TSM) also known as TSMC, is the largest semiconductor (chip) foundry in the world, powering many of the electronics we use in our daily lives. With TSMC's foundry model, it creates chips specifically for customers' needs instead of general sales. This gives it a much more personal relationship with many of its customers and increases its importance to the tech world.\nTSMC chips are used in smartphones, car infotainment systems, gaming consoles, GPUs, and many other products. Given the importance of TSMC's chips in creating GPUs, there's arguably no company as vital to Nvidia as TSMC. Nvidia's ability to meet the surge in demand for its GPUs largely depends on TSMC's manufacturing capacity.\nWithout these chips, GPU quality likely suffers, which then bleeds over into data centers and, ultimately, many of the AI applications and services consumers interact with. So far, though, this reliance hasn't posed a problem for TSMC. In the second quarter, it made $20.8 billion in revenue, up 33% from a year ago.\nTSMC's high-power computing (HPC) segment, which includes AI-related chips, generated 52% of the revenue, up from 46% in the first quarter. It expects revenue from AI-related chips to grow at a 50% compound annual growth rate over the next five years, which would make it around 20% of TSMC's total revenue.\nAlthough TSMC's stock is up close to 60% this year, it dropped by over 6% in the past month, giving investors a more attractive price to consider. With a price-to-earnings ratio close to 29, the stock isn't cheap, but the company's importance can make it justifiable for long-term investors.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock had an impressive year, but the past month has been a bit brutal. The stock is down by over 9% since early July, bumping it down to the world's second-most valuable company after spending the better part of the last year up top.\nMicrosoft was seemingly ahead of the game when it first began its partnership with ChatGPT's creator, OpenAI, back in 2019 with a $1 billion investment. It has since expanded its partnership with OpenAI and both parties seem to be playing an equal part in the deal.\nOpenAI gets to use Microsoft's cloud service, Azure, for its infrastructure and supercomputing power. In return, Microsoft gets to integrate OpenAI's AI technologies into its large suite of products and services. It's a move that makes perfect sense for Microsoft, considering the money, personnel, and time it would take to build these capabilities in-house.\nMicrosoft is arguably the most well-diversified big tech company, with its hands in seemingly all things enterprise. It's the go-to for many products and services for businesses globally, which has helped it ensure its longevity as a tech titan. Nvidia, on the other hand, will rely heavily on GPUs, making its business and continued growth reliant on AI adaption (which has yet to be seen in the long term).\nMicrosoft's all-but-ensured longevity makes it easier to justify its high 36.8 P/E ratio if you're in it for the long haul. That's expensive by most standards, but dollar-cost averaging your way into a stake could pay off well down the road.\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Kent Thune ",
        "Text": "After logging one of the worst weeks for semiconductor stocks in 2024, AI ETFs started a new week with healthy gains as optimism about Nvidia returned, and investors felt a Trump presidency was less assured.\nThe largest AI exchange-traded fund with Nvidia as a top holding, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), rose nearly 4% on the renewed optimism.\nExcitement around Nvidia comes as its promising Blackwell architecture for generative AI returned to focus and President Biden\u2019s exit from the November election neutralized former president Trump\u2019s questioning U.S. support for Taiwan last week.\nNVDA rose nearly 5% and TSM gained more than 2% in Monday trading.\nThe incredible rise of AI ETFs has largely been supported by the dominance of Nvidia stock, the top holding in many of these mega-cap tech funds. Nvidia\u2019s gains have been driven by its ability to beat earnings forecasts. Nvidia's Blackwell release date is expected in late 2024 to early 2025, and excitement over the \u201cnew era\u201d GPU architecture is expected by many analysts to be transformative\u00a0for artificial intelligence.\nHere's a breakdown of what Blackwell brings to the table:\nFocus on Generative AI: Unlike previous Nvidia architectures geared toward diverse computing tasks, Blackwell is purpose-built for generative AI, a rapidly growing field focused on creating new content like text, images, or code.\nUnmatched Performance: Nvidia says that Blackwell delivers 30 times better performance on large language models compared to its predecessor. This significant leap allows for more complex and powerful AI applications.\nIncreased Efficiency: The company says that Blackwell will have 25 times greater energy efficiency compared to the prior generation. This may translate to lower operational costs for businesses and reduced environmental impact.\nCustom Manufacturing Process: Blackwell GPUs are built using a 4NP manufacturing process tailored by TSMC, a leading chip manufacturer. This customization should improve power and performance, the company says. Superchip Design: Blackwell GPUs use a \"superchip\" design featuring two interconnected dies. This essentially creates a single, powerful AI processing unit.\nHigh Bandwidth Connectivity: The two dies within a Blackwell GPU are linked by a high-speed, 10 terabytes per second (TB/s) connection, enabling efficient data transfer and processing.\nInvestors are banking that the Blackwell architecture will represent a significant leap in AI processing capabilities that can improve different fields, including natural language processing, computer vision and robotic automation. How this affects price remains uncertain.\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com. All rights reserved\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 20 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other profitable stocks.\nThe stock market has a long history of generating wealth for investors. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, studying successful companies can provide valuable insights. By understanding the factors that drive these companies' growth, we can potentially make better investment decisions in the future. It's important to remember that investing involves risk, and conducting thorough research is crucial before making any investment decisions.\nInvestors frequently overlook revenue in favor of profitability when evaluating stocks. Profit is what's left over after all costs are paid. Revenue is the total amount of goods and services sold. Because it is essential to determine if a business is a growth stock or a value one, profitability is important. To learn more about growth stocks, see 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024. You can also discover some undervalued value stocks by reading 11 Oversold Value Stocks To Buy Now.\nThe U.S. stock market has seen several major events since 2000, including the dot-com boom and fall, the 2008 financial crisis, a tech boom with trillion-dollar values, and the 2020 pandemic crisis. The S&P's broader market index produced double-digit yearly returns thirteen times between 2003 and 2023. This strong performance can be largely attributed to the phenomenal returns generated by technology stocks, which significantly boosted the overall return of the large-cap market.\nAccording to a recent estimate, the aggregate market value of the top seven S&P 500 corporations is almost double that of the Japanese market. The head of topical research and global economics, Jim Reid, cautions that this is the most concentrated the US market has ever been.\nAs interest in growth stocks increases due to the hype surrounding AI and the prospect of rate cuts, these companies' fortunes are expected to soar. To satisfy market demand, businesses are making significant investments in AI. AI's impact on altering work patterns was highlighted by Satya Nadella du. According to them,:\n\u201cA growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks.\"\nTo identify the most profitable stocks, we looked at the 20-year annualized returns of publicly traded companies in the US market from 2004 to 2024 and selected and ranked those with the highest 20-year annualized returns.\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n20-Year Annualized Return: 39.81%\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) tops the list for being one of the most profitable stocks over the past 20 years, delivering exceptional returns to investors. Bullish analysts are highly optimistic about NVIDIA's future prospects. NVIDIA has recently achieved significant milestones across various sectors, particularly in AI and cloud computing.

        "Text": "A group of Chinese graphics processing unit (GPU) developers are taking advantage of Nvidia's absence in China at the country's largest artificial intelligence (AI) show to promote their offerings, although they face problems related to manufacturing and software ecosystem bottlenecks.\nIluvatar Corex, Moore Threads, Tencent Holdings-backed Enflame Technology, Sophgo, Huawei Technologies' Ascend were the centre of attention last week at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, where the California-based designer of the chips against which all other AI GPUs are measured had no physical presence. Nvidia's name, however, was invoked constantly at the booths of Chinese chip makers comparing their own offerings to those of the US tech giant.\n\"China's computing clusters are changing from being foreign-GPU-dominated to a combination of Chinese GPUs and foreign ones,\" Enflame chief ecosystem officer Li Xingyu said during a session on Friday. \"There is a problem of a lack of demand, so much of the computational power in China still sits idle.\"\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\"Further lowering the barriers to using home-grown computational power is key to increasing its application in China,\" he added.\nMoore Threads' MCCX D800 AI server displayed at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai on July 5, 2024. Photo: Che Pan alt=Moore Threads' MCCX D800 AI server displayed at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai on July 5, 2024. Photo: Che Pan>\nCooperating with Shanghai-based chip designer Enflame, AI solutions firm Infinigence - another start-up backed by Chinese social media and video gaming giant Tencent - is offering compute resources that use a variety of chips from Nvidia and other vendors, including Chinese GPU makers. \"Companies don't need to worry about which GPUs they use,\" the company said.\nNvidia is not allowed to export its most advanced chips to China under US export restrictions. Washington has also added major Chinese chip developers to a trade blacklist, making it hard for them to find foundries to manufacture their designs. Huawei - which has claimed its Ascend 910B is on par with Nvidia's A100 - is among those facing manufacturing hurdles, as it was initially blacklisted in 2019 and has seen sanctions tighten since then.\nThe area around Huawei's booth was one of the busiest on the floor. Huawei Ascend chips are configured for open-source large language models including Meta's Llama2, according to a slide presentation on-site. The chips are also used for training half of China's more than 70 large models, Huawei previously claimed in a presentation at the Zhongguancun Forum in May.\nEnflame showcased its Cloudblazer T20 and T21 AI-training chips at the show. An employee said that the company's biggest advantage over bigger rivals such as Huawei, Moore Threads and Biren Technology is that it is not on the US trade blacklist. This means it has access to global foundries like TSMC, which makes roughly 90 per cent of the world's most advanced chips, despite broader sanctions that limit the computational power of its chips.\nNvidia chips tailored for Chinese clients to get around US restrictions are also still proving popular.\nNvidia is expected to deliver more than 1 million H20 GPUs in China this year, racking up US$12 billion in sales, according to San Francisco-based semiconductor research firm SemiAnalysis. Dylan Patel, chief analyst at SemiAnalysis, said Nvidia's H20 still offers better performance than Huawei's 910B.\n\"China is a large market with strong demand for AI, but the biggest problem is that the in-house technology is behind their global peers and won't be enough to meet the domestic demand,\" said Robert Cheng, head of Taiwan research and Asia-Pacific hardware at BofA Global Research.\n\"The AI GPUs China can have are not as strong as global [alternatives] performance-wise, and ... [the Chinese supply chain] in general is still far behind,\" he added.\nMainland China remained Nvidia's third-largest market in the financial year ended January 28, with sales from China up 78 per cent year on year to US$10.3 billion.\nAdditional reporting by Iris Deng.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Author": "  GlobalData Technology ",
        "Text": "In one of the most significant moves made by any telecoms operator in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) to turbocharge AI capabilities, Ooredoo Group is boosting its 26 data centres by incorporating Nvidia\u2019s high-density graphics processing units (GPUs).\nIt is also becoming the region\u2019s first Nvidia Cloud Provider. As a result, Ooredoo will be developing an AI- and ML-ready platform powered by Nvidia\u2019s stack of software and services, including generative AI (GenAI).\nThe deal follows a similar one struck by Ooredoo\u2019s Indonesian unit Indosat with Nvidia in February 2024, where it was announced that Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell platform will be incorporated into Indosat\u2019s infrastructure to bring sovereign AI cloud and services to Indonesia via a planned $200m AI data centre in Surakarta.\nA step up from central processing units (CPUs), GPU chips aid in workload acceleration of heavy processing tasks, offering enterprise customers access to the latest AI capabilities tailored for high-demand computing tasks. Sectors that can significantly benefit from this are infrastructure, energy, and mining, with healthcare, finance, education, and telecommunications also set to profit.\nAs a Nvidia Cloud Provider, Ooredoo has signalled its intent to be a leading digital infrastructure provider in MENA. Each Ooredoo unit will be able to establish its own local clouds, bringing AI infrastructure closer to both Ooredoo and non-Ooredoo customers, and allow for greater data sovereignty and security in compliance with local laws. Ooredoo stated it is investing $1bn to boost its data centre capacity by 65% by 2030, adding that it is seeing cloud adoption growing by an average of 30% year-on-year.\nThe export of advanced proprietary US technology has been a concern to US lawmakers, with government restrictions being placed on Middle Eastern orders for high-end AI chips, in an attempt to thwart China potentially intercepting them. There is currently a bottleneck of regional customers ordering chips and other technologies from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, as well as US hyperscalers. Ooredoo\u2019s deal with Nvidia can be interpreted in one of three ways:\nThe policy has been unofficially relaxed in order to mitigate increasing Chinese tech influence in the region, as evidenced by Huawei\u2019s recent deployment of a cloud region in Egypt - the first global tech firm to do so in North Africa.\nThe GPUs purchased by Ooredoo have been categorised as mid-range technologies that fall outside the stringent US restrictions.\nThe geographical restriction of technologies like AI manufactured by the likes of Nvidia is not sustainable into the long term. So, vendors are testing the limits of strict criteria of US export controls.\nOoredoo added that the three Middle Eastern countries where is operates - Qatar, Kuwait, and Oman - host US military bases and large US corporations, which in turn can be customers of these technologies. Other Middle Eastern AI vendors, like the UAE\u2019s G42, is phasing out Chinese hardware, which has enabled it to secure a $1.5bn AI deal with Microsoft in April 2024.\nWhatever the case, it is clear that MENA is heating up as a tech battleground between China and the US. The one that will profit from this dynamic are the telecoms operators in the region, and by extension, local and regional businesses.\n\"The US dilemma of the Ooredoo-Nvidia tie-up\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), undeniably, has been the standout stock of the year. Its dominance in the stock market extends even further, with a staggering 800% surge in its stock price in less than two years.\nYet, recent sales by billionaires -- including company insiders -- have many investors on edge. Moreover, there is an additional factor, which is flashing warning signs for Nvidia. \nSo, let's dive in and see what's going on with Wall Street's hottest stock.\nFirst, let's get a handle on two things:\nWhich billionaires are selling Nvidia stock.\nHow much stock they're selling.\nObviously, there are many billionaires who own Nvidia stock, but there are only a select number who are forced to disclose their stock purchases and sales. For the purposes of this article, I'll cover billionaires that are company insiders (defined as company officers or those with over 10% beneficial ownership).\nLet's focus on two billionaire company insiders: Jensen Huang (Nvidia's CEO and founder) and Mark Stevens (Nvidia board member). Huang's net worth is estimated at over $100 billion; Stevens' is estimated at over $8 billion. So far this year, Huang and Stevens sold a combined $731 million in Nvidia stock -- Huang sold $366 million worth of stock; Stevens sold $365 million.\nEven though these are massive stock sales, they must be put into context. Huang, for example, owns more than 800 million shares of Nvidia stock, worth over $100 billion as of this writing. Stevens owns nearly 39 million shares of Nvidia, which are worth close to $5 billion.\nSo, from that standpoint, neither one is dumping Nvidia shares hand over fist. Rather, they have sold very small portions of their massive holdings. Stevens sold 0.7% of his stock this year, while Huang has sold even less -- only 0.3%.\nWhat's more, there are many reasons insiders sell stock. For example:\nPortfolio diversification.\nCharitable giving.\nPersonal expenses.\nOutside business projects.\nInvestors should approach insider sales with caution, understanding that they can sometimes be significant but often require a deeper understanding of the context.\nIn any event, there is another factor regarding Nvidia stock that investors should be paying attention to.\u00a0\nTo properly value a stock, investors have to examine more than just its price. That's because the price investors pay for a stock doesn't take into account important factors such as the number of shares outstanding or the underlying financial health of the company.\nThat's why valuation metrics like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio are critical when attempting to compare two or more stocks. They allow investors to make apples-to-apples comparisons.\nThe problem for Nvidia is that by examining its current P/S ratio, for example, it's clear that the stock is trading at an unsustainable level.\nHere is Nvidia's P/S ratio dating back to its initial public offering (IPO) in 1999:\nIts current level (37 times) is nearly 500% greater than its lifetime average (8 times). That's troubling in and of itself, but the concerns grow when comparing Nvidia to other tech stocks.\nMicrosoft is another company whose stock price benefited as the AI revolution has taken off. However, its stock trades with a P/S ratio of 14 times. And while that is almost double its historical average (8 times), it's still well below Nvidia's. Moreover, when examining Microsoft's lifetime P/S ratio, you do see a period when its stock traded with a sky-high P/S ratio of 30 times. That was during the lead-up to the dot-com stock bubble of 2001. And remember, following that bubble, Microsoft's stock dropped 65%.\nIn summary, Nvidia's insider selling may be a red herring. However, the stock's lofty valuation should give investors pause. While the company's surging revenue could help moderate its valuation, risks remain that the stock is overpriced at current levels and could experience a pull-back -- particularly if actual sales fall short of heightened expectations. \nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Matt DiLallo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend. Its chips have been in high demand, which is powering tremendous revenue and earnings growth for the semiconductor company. It has made Nvidia one of the most highly valued companies in the world. \nHowever, Nvidia isn't the only company benefiting from the AI boom. The AI training models and applications that run on its chips reside in data centers. Those facilities are power-hungry buildings, especially when they support AI. \nBecause of that, power demand could surge in the coming years. That should benefit energy stocks, including the underappreciated natural gas sector. Here are a couple of ways to play the potential AI-fueled boom in natural gas demand.\nNatural gas demand has grown steadily over the years. Several catalysts have fueled this growth, including replacing coal with the cleaner-burning fuel and rising LNG exports. Demand for gas could accelerate in the future, powered partly by AI data centers: \nAs that slide shows, data centers alone could drive an additional 10 billion to 18 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of demand by 2030. That's potentially more growth than the sector saw over the last decade. \nMany companies in the natural gas industry should benefit from rising gas demand. One potential beneficiary is the country's leading gas producer, EQT (NYSE: EQT). The company controls over 1.1 million net acres of land in the gas-rich Appalachian region (Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia). That large-scale position in one of the best gas-producing regions in the world enables it to produce gas at a very low cost ($1.36 per million cubic foot equivalent). \nEQT is also ideally situated to supply gas to power data centers. The company has pipeline access (either those it will soon own via its Equitrans Midstream acquisition, or from contracts with third-party pipeline operators) to several data center clusters: \nEQT should generate significant free cash flow in the coming years, fueled by growing gas demand and other catalysts like its pending Equitrans deal and contracts to supply new LNG export facilities. The company estimates that it could produce a cumulative $7.5 billion to more than $25 billion in free cash flow in the 2025 to 2029 period, assuming gas averages between $2.75 and $5 per MMBtu. \nThat high end is more likely if AI lives up to its potential. This robust cash flow will give it the funds to repay debt, pay dividends, and repurchase shares, which could fuel strong total returns for investors. \nNatural gas pipeline companies are another potential big beneficiary of rising power demand fueled by AI data centers. That catalyst would increase transportation volumes on existing pipelines while providing them with new expansion opportunities. \nOne of the many potential beneficiaries is Williams (NYSE: WMB). The company operates the Transco pipeline, which runs along the East Coast, serving high-demand areas like Atlanta, Charlotte, North Carolina, and the capital region. Those areas are also hotbeds for data centers, which tend to be near major cities. \nIn particular, Transco could be a key to supplying gas to data centers in Virginia. Regional utility Dominion Energy expects power demand from facilities in its service area to grow by two and a half times over the next decade. \nWilliams currently has seven projects underway to expand Transco (and three more across its other major natural gas transmission pipelines). It has 30 more gas transmission pipeline projects in development. On top of that, the company has other gas infrastructure projects underway to grow its position in the Gulf of Mexico, Western U.S., and Northeast (where EQT operates). \nThese projects give Williams a lot of visibility. The pipeline giant expects to grow its earnings by 5% to 7% annually over the long term. That should give it the fuel to increase its high-yielding dividend (recently around 4.5%) by a similar rate. That combination of dividend income, earnings growth, and valuation upside potential could enable Williams to generate robust total returns in the coming years. \nNvidia has been an early beneficiary of the AI boom. However, the technology will likely fuel growth for many other sectors, including natural gas. The market hasn't yet fully appreciated the growth potential for the cleaner-burning fuel, which allows investors to get in early and potentially earn high-octane returns. EQT and Williams stand out as some of the biggest beneficiaries, given their proximity to where tech companies are building data centers. \nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Author": "  Johnny Rice ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI), which some are hailing as the next technological revolution on par with the internet, is the investing theme of the moment.\nThe incredible promise of the technology led investors to lift Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock to dizzying heights. The semiconductor powerhouse designs and sells the chips that make AI possible, putting it in a unique position in the emerging industry that led to quarter after quarter of incredible revenue growth.\nSo why did its CEO, Jensen Huang, sell 700,000 shares of its stock last week? Well, in short, I don't know. No one but Huang and his accountant do. What I do know is that there are plenty of reasons that don't involve him losing faith in his company. Although it's tempting to see it as a reason to run for the hills, it's really not.\nInvestors have to keep things in perspective. Jensen Huang owns more than 800 million shares, worth north of $100 billion, for those counting. The shares he sold last week amount to less than 0.1% of his net worth. Do you think that shows a lack of faith? Huang likely sold these shares for something as boring as paying taxes.\nWhile it's interesting to see what a C-suite is doing with its company's stock, you can't rely on it to make decisions. Instead, always return to evaluating the business as a whole. So, is Nvidia still a good pick?\nIt looks to be continuing as well \u2014 at least in the short term. Consensus estimates put the company's revenue at $120.6 billion this year, a nearly 98% jump from last year. That is serious growth for any company, let alone one vying for the title of the biggest company in the world by market cap.\nNow, observers have to expect this to cool somewhat, but can the chipmaker still sustain strong growth moving forward? Well, there are some pretty tall hurdles to clear. The most pressing threat comes from ramped-up competition from its old rival, AMD.\nThis company has set its sights on grabbing some of Nvidia's pie, and although it likely will, it's a matter of how much. Thankfully for Nvidia investors, AMD is currently being outspent almost two to one by Nvidia in research and development (R&D), and it has the resources to keep it this way. I think this will allow Nvidia to stay one or two steps ahead for some time.\nWhile plenty of challenges lie ahead for Nvidia, perhaps the biggest is whether AI itself actually delivers on its promise. Despite all the hype, there's still a lot to prove. It wouldn't be the first time a technology failed to deliver to the degree investors hoped.\nThink of AI and all the businesses that enable it and benefit from it as a river. Nvidia is somewhere in the middle, upstream from the companies that deliver AI products to the end market. If those companies can't deliver AI products to the market that create immense economic benefit, they can't justify buying the hardware Nvidia produces, at least not at the same rate. In other words, the river dries up. AI has to actually deliver real value to real people \u2014 otherwise, Nvidia may have some issues.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation.\u00a0Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer in a program last week tried to make sense of the decline in tech stocks, saying companies with the \u201cbest fundamentals\u201d got \u201chammered once again.\u201d\n\u201cI did not expect that to happen.\u201d\nCramer said that sometimes it\u2019s difficult to own the \u201cwinners.\u201d The CNBC host said it\u2019s important to understand the bear cases around stocks otherwise you will never know what \u201cyou are up against.\u201d\nJim Cramer tried to find out whether the latest decline in top tech stocks was just a \u201cperiodic selloff\u201d that presented an \u201copportunity.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we get this kind of rotation, you never know whether these stocks are selling off because there\u2019s something wrong or because they are up huge.\u201d\nJim Cramer pointed to a caveat when it comes to holding winning stocks. When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.\nThe CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has \u201cchanged.\u201d\n\u201cFrom what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.\u201d\nIn this program, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies\u2019 fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\n\u00a0\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\nCramer said in a latest program mentioned a new research paper by Hendrik Bessembinder from Arizona State University. Here is what the paper said:\n\u201cThe highest annualized compound return for any stock with at least 20 years of return data was 33.38%, earned by NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shareholders,\u201d the paper said.\nCramer said that he thought this was an \u201camazing number\u201d until his colleague David Faber reminded him that this is \u201cwhat-have-you-done-for-me-lately business, so it does not matter.\u201d\n\u201cThis kind of selloff, that\u2019s the prevailing attitude. That\u2019s why everyone wants out,\u201d Cramer said.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) rapid run and soaring valuation have started to make some circles on Wall Street uneasy. New Street Research recently downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy and set the stock\u2019s price target at $135.\n\u201cWe downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.\u201d New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu said.\nNYU professor and valuation guru Aswath Damodoran has also been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has \u201cno idea what I\u2019m talking about\u201d or it\u2019s the market that just does not understand.\nAswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the \u201cdriving seat\u201d of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won\u2019t be as easy as the market assumes.\nRecently, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have gained about 174% over the past year.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn the second quarter, the dominant narrative in markets continued to be generative AI (GenAI). If it wasn\u2019t immediately evident from\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) meteoric rise to among the largest companies in the world, one need only look so far as the Semiconductor and Technology Hardware industries as a gauge of sentiment, collectively accounting for greater than 70% of the Russell 1000 Growth (\u201cthe Index\u201d) and 85% of the S&P 500 headline return quarter to date.\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang\nSEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's SK Hynix posted its highest quarterly profit since 2018 on Thursday as the Nvidia supplier said strong AI chip demand will only get stronger, such as for high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in generative AI chipsets.\n\"AI demand continues to grow above expectations... We expect next year's HBM shipments to more than double this year's,\" Head of DRAM Marketing Kim Kyu Hyun said in an earnings call.\nHowever, SK Hynix shares dropped as much as 8.4% in morning trade, tracking declines in U.S. shares such as Nvidia, as tech firms' results failed to meet sky-high investor expectations.\nThe world's second-largest memory chip maker has benefited the most among peers from AI-driven appetite for high-end chips and enterprise solid-state drives (eSSDs), following its early entry and large investment in the segments.\nThe company reported 5.47 trillion won ($3.96 billion) in operating profit for April-June, its highest since the third quarter of 2018.\nThe figure compared with a loss of 2.9 trillion won a year earlier and was in line with the LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward analysts who are more consistently accurate.\nRevenue rose 125% to a record 16.4 trillion won.\nAI DEMAND\nPrices have been lifted by explosive demand for high-end DRAM chips such as HBM, chips used in data centre servers and gadgets that run on-device AI services.\n\"DRAM prices are rising despite the lack of complete recovery in traditional buyer demand, as chipmakers concentrate production capacity on HBM,\" CFO Kim Woohyun said.\nSK Hynix leads the HBM market and is the main supplier of those chips to Nvidia, in competition with Samsung Electronics and the United States' Micron. Nvidia commands some 80% of the artificial intelligence chip market.\nSK Hynix began mass production of fifth-generation HBM chips - called HBM3E - in March, with initial shipments going to Nvidia, sources previously told Reuters.\nOn Thursday, the chipmaker disclosed plans to ship the next versions of HBM chips - the 12-layer HBM3E starting in the fourth quarter and the HBM4 starting in the second half of 2025.\nSamsung has yet to meet Nvidia's standards for HBM3E chips, though Samsung's fourth-generation HBM - dubbed HBM3 - has been cleared by Nvidia for use in its less-sophisticated graphics processors, the H20, developed for the Chinese market, sources have told Reuters.\n\"SK Hynix is saying it will keep its technical leadership, stay ahead of competitors,\" said analyst Lee Min-hee at BNK Investment & Securities. \"But investor expectations are so high they may be hard to meet, and in the short term, the stock price may not rise as much.\"\nHBMs could account for 20% of SK Hynix's profit for DRAM chips by the end of 2024, from almost 0% in the first half of 2023, analysts said, given Nvidia is likely to accelerate plans for next-generation graphics processors to meet soaring demand created by the generative AI boom.\nIn May, SK Hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung said its HBM chips were sold out for this year and almost sold out for 2025.\nOne of South Korea's top stock picks for the AI boom, SK Hynix shares have risen 47% year-to-date as of Wednesday.\n($1=1,380.3400 won)\n(Reporting by Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang; Editing by Tom Hogue and Christopher Cushing)\n"

        "Text": "Semiconductors are at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Developing the most advanced AI models wouldn't be possible without the data center graphics processing units (GPUs) designed by the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nThat company added $2.8 trillion to its market capitalization over the past 18 months alone thanks to surging demand for its GPUs. But the value created by AI is now reaching other companies in the chip space, including Nvidia's competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).\nInvestors could profit from this trend by purchasing a cross-section of the entire chip industry, and an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) makes that really simple.\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF delivered a compound annual return of 25.3% over the last 10 years, crushing the 12.7% annual gain in the S&P 500 index over the same period.\nThe ETF climbed to as high as $680 per share in March, which made it somewhat expensive for smaller investors. To address that problem, iShares executed a 3-for-1 stock split, which increased the number of shares in circulation threefold, and organically reduced the price per share by two-thirds. One share of the ETF now trades for around $254.\nThat's positive news because a broader investor base can now benefit from this ETF's momentum on the back of the AI boom. Here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return if this scenario plays out.\nThe iShares ETF owns 30 different semiconductor stocks, but it's heavily weighted toward its Top 5 holdings which account for 37.8% of the total value of its portfolio:\nStock\niShares ETF Portfolio Weighting\n1. Broadcom\n9.57%\n2. Nvidia\n8.60%\n3. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n7.22%\n4. Applied Materials\n6.59%\n5. Qualcomm\n5.82%\nData source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of July 3, 2024, and are subject to change.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) makes networking components for the data center, including switches that regulate how fast data travels from servers to devices. Its AI-related revenue soared 280% in its recent fiscal 2024 second quarter, and it's forecasted to bring in a record $11 billion from AI during the whole of fiscal 2024 (which ends Oct. 30).\nNvidia makes the world's most powerful GPUs for developing AI models. Its data center revenue has grown by triple-digit percentages in each of the last four quarters, and the company still can't keep up with demand. It's gearing up to ship new GPUs based on its latest Blackwell architecture, like the GB200 which can inference AI models five times faster than its industry-leading H100. It could save developers truckloads of money, as they often pay for computing capacity by the minute.\nAMD is trying to compete with Nvidia in the data center market with its new MI300 GPU. However, the company already has a dominant 90% share in the processor market for AI-enabled personal computers, which could be an incredible opportunity as AI migrates from the data center to the devices we use every day.\nOutside of its top five, the iShares ETF holds a number of other stocks critical to the AI industry. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing manufactures half of the world's chips, including those designed by Nvidia and AMD. Micron Technology, on the other hand, makes memory and storage chips which are key to processing AI workloads. Its latest HBM3e memory solution powers some of Nvidia's latest GPUs.\nSince its inception in 2001, the iShares ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 11.7%. However, it delivered a compound annual return of 25.3% over the last 10 years on the back of explosive demand for chips in segments like smartphones, cloud computing, enterprise software, and now, AI.\nThe table below shows how long it could take for the iShares ETF to turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million, based on three scenarios:\nScenario 1: The ETF delivers an annual return of 11.7% going forward, matching its long-term average.\nScenario 2: The ETF delivers an annual return of 18.5% going forward (midpoint of scenarios 1 and 3).\nScenario 3: The ETF delivers an annual return of 25.3% going forward, matching its 10-year average.\nStarting Balance\nCompound Annual Return\nTime to Reach $1 Million\n$200,000\n11.7%\n15 years\n$200,000\n18.5%\n10 years\n$200,000\n25.3%\n8 years\nCalculations by author.\nIn short, the ETF could deliver a fivefold return over the next 15 years even if it reverts back to its long-term annual average return of 11.7%. But AI could be the greatest financial opportunity the chip sector has ever faced. According to Goldman Sachs, AI could add $7 trillion to the global economy over the next decade, and Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management places that figure at $200 trillion by 2030!\nWith that said, this ETF will almost certainly underperform if AI fails to live up to the hype, because stocks like Nvidia would lose a large chunk of the gains they generated over the past year. There is also a possibility that AI software eventually becomes a bigger value creator than AI hardware, which could shift the gains to stocks outside the chip space. That's why it's best to buy the iShares ETF as part of a balanced portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine ",
        "Text": "Nvidia shares have surged 760% since the beginning of 2023, and Broadcom shares have surged 205% during the same period. Nvidia has already reset its share price by completing a 10-for-1 stock split on June 7, and Broadcom has a 10-for-1 stock split planned for July 12.\nImportantly, Nvidia was the fourth-most expensive stock in the Nasdaq-100 prior to its split, and Broadcom is currently the third-most expensive stock in the index. That's not surprising. The primary purpose of a forward stock split is to reduce the share price, thereby making the stock more accessible and more liquid.\nWith that in mind, the Nasdaq-100 stock most likely to split next is the one with the highest price, which is Booking Holdings. However, as my colleague Jon Quast eloquently describes, CEO Glen Fogel opposes the idea of a stock split. So, we can strike Booking Holdings from the list and move on to the next most expensive stock, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI).\nInvestors should never buy a stock just because they expect it to split, but MercadoLibre is a worthwhile long-term investment whether it splits or not. Read on to see why.\nMercadoLibre operates the largest online commerce and payments ecosystem in Latin America, a region where e-commerce penetration is about half that of the United States. Its marketplace receives nearly four times as many monthly visitors as the next competitor. MercadoLibre is expected to account for 29% of domestic online retail sales this year, up 70 basis points (0.7 percentage points) from the prior year.\nMercadoLibre has reinforced its success with adjacent financial services, logistics support, and advertising tools, which make its marketplace more convenient for merchants. The company has been successful on all counts. MercadoLibre is one of the largest fintech companies in Latin America, it operates the fastest and most extensive domestic delivery network, and it accounts for more than 50% of retail media ad spending in the region.\nMercadoLibre reported strong financial results in the first quarter, handily beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 36% to $4.3 billion, reflecting sales growth in the commerce and fintech segments of 49% and 22%, respectively. Meanwhile, GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income increased 71% to $6.78 per diluted share.\nDuring the first quarter, commerce sales benefited from increased adoption of fulfillment and advertising services, indicating that MercadoLibre is more effectively monetizing merchants on its marketplace. Additionally, fintech sales benefited from accelerating growth in total payment volume and increased engagement with credit products.\nThe chart below shows MercadoLibre's revenue growth across both segments over the last five quarters.\nGiven its strong presence in several markets, investors have good reason to believe MercadoLibre can maintain that momentum. The company is steadily gaining share in e-commerce, which bodes well for its fintech and advertising businesses. In fact, MercadoLibre is forecasted to be the fastest-growing ad tech company in the world in 2024.\nMore broadly, the digital economy in Latin America is expected to expand at 23% annually over the next three years.\nWall Street expects MercadoLibre to grow earnings per share at 51% annually through 2026. In that context, the current valuation of 74.2 times earnings appears reasonable, especially when the two-year average is 109.7 times earnings.\nInvestors should be cognizant of the risks. Most notably, Argentina (MercadoLibre's third-largest geography behind Brazil and Mexico) is suffering from hyperinflation, such that domestic sales declined 22% in the first quarter, as measured in U.S. dollars, despite surging 239%, as measured in Argentine pesos. That will likely be a headwind for the foreseeable future.\nMercadoLibre has historically been a very volatile stock. It carries a three-year beta of 1.59, meaning it moved 159 basis points for every 100-basis-point movement in the S&P 500 during the last three years. Volatility cuts both ways. When MercadoLibre shares are rising, they can rise quickly. But when the stock is falling, it can fall sharply.\nInvestors comfortable with that type of risk and volatility should consider buying a small position in this potential Nasdaq-100 stock-split stock today.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\nTop Calls:\nNew Street downgraded Nvidia (NVDA) to Neutral from Buy with a one-year price target of $135. The firm says the shares are \"getting fully valued for the base case.\" Share upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and New Street does not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says the \"quality of the franchise is nevertheless intact,\" and it would be buyers again of Nvidia, \"but only on prolonged weakness.\" Among the artificial intelligence stocks, New Street views AMD (AMD) and TSMC (TSM) as the most attractive, the firm noted.\nChina Renaissance upgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $282.13, up from $151.31. The analyst increased estimates to reflect the \"substantial expansion\" of Tesla's energy storage business in Q2. The firm sees \"re-rating opportunities\" for the shares from an improving electric vehicle business and new products from Full-Self Driving, Robotaxi, and the company's robot segments.\nRaymond James downgraded Spirit Airlines (SAVE) to Underperform, a sell-equivalent rating, from Market Perform without a price target. The downgrade reflects a slightly lower fuel outlook and weaker fare trends, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says the budget airline setup into Q3 is \"clear as mud\" given the \"rapid market and product modifications and potential headwinds. The risks are greatest at Frontier and Spirit despite the \"already weak share price and investor sentiment,\" adds Raymond James. The firm does not believe a bankruptcy filing is a foregone conclusion for Spirit, and says the GTF engine compensation has been good. However, it does not fully offset the earnings impacts from aircraft on ground, which is a materially greater issue for Spirit than any other U.S. airline and expected to get worse in 2025, the firm adds.\nRaymond James downgraded Frontier Group (ULCC) to Underperform from Market Perform without a price target. The downgrade reflects a slightly lower fuel outlook and weaker fare trends, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm says the budget airline setup into Q3 is \"clear as mud\" given the \"rapid market and product modifications\" and potential headwinds. The risks are greatest at Frontier and Spirit despite the \"already weak share price and investor sentiment,\" adds Raymond James. The firm says that despite network changes to improve operations, Frontier's completion factor lags that of most U.S. peers both on an absolute and year-over-year basis. Raymond views the airline's adjustments to August schedules as a \"Band-Aid\" to its longer-term concerns around Frontier's planned growth with 240-seat A321s.\nExane BNP Paribas upgraded Lloyds Banking (LYG) to Outperform from Neutral with a 72 GBp price target. The analyst replaced NatWest Group (NWG) with Lloyds as the firm's top pick in UK banks. Confirmation of a Labour party majority add visibility for equity investors, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm believes the banks will largely stay out of the political headlines in the coming weeks, which is welcome. The focus can now shift back to improving operating trends, according to Exane.\n"

It would target companies like TSMC and ASML \u2014 both of which are crucial machinery producers for China's own chipmaking business.\nIn practice, the rule would likely force Taiwan and the Netherlands, where TSMC and ASML respectively based, to tighten their own trade regulations with China.\nImplementing the rule would be the Biden administration's latest attempt at cracking down on China's chipmaking business in the hopes of further boosting chipmaking in the US and limiting Beijing's access to cutting-edge technology.\nLast November, the US Department of Commerce's Advanced Computing Chips Rule increased sanctions on American-made advanced AI chips, making it increasingly difficult for China to import those from Nvidia, whose chips have been in huge demand to power AI models. And in March, the Biden administration considered sanctions on Chinese semiconductor firms linked to China-based Huawei.\nThe US blocked China from importing advanced Nvidia chips in 2022, but hasn't completely stopped the chips from making their way into the country with some reports of travelers smuggling the chips in their suitcases or buying via resellers.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Title": "Should Investors Buy AI Stock Nvidia Before Aug. 28?",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) will announce its second quarter results after the closing bell rings on Wednesday, August 28, 2024. The semiconductor company topped consensus estimates with its last four reports, so Wall Street analysts may have inflated expectations. But there is another reason the stakes are particularly high this time around.\nNvidia shares have advanced 126% year to date, making it the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) behind Super Micro Computer. Investors are clearly excited about artificial intelligence (AI), perhaps too excited. Valuations are creeping higher and some experts think the \"AI bubble\" will burst in the not-too-distant future, at least temporarily.\nIn short, Nvidia shares could decline sharply following its second-quarter report on Aug. 28, either because the company misses estimates or because the market is nervous about the durability of AI spending. Is it safe to buy the stock right now?\nNvidia topped Wall Street's consensus revenue and earnings forecasts in each of the last four quarters. But the company beat estimates by increasingly small margins with each subsequent report. If that trend persists, Nvidia could miss expectations when it announces financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 on Aug. 28.\nThe chart below shows how Wall Street's consensus revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) forecasts compare to Nvidia's actual results last year.\nFinancial Metric\nQ2 2024 (Actual)\nQ2 2025 (Estimate)\nChange\nRevenue\n$13.5 billion\n$28.5 billion\n111%\nNon-GAAP EPS\n$0.27\n$0.64\n137%\nData Source: The Wall Street consensus as reported by Morgan Stanley.\nEven if Nvidia beats estimates, the stock could still decline following the report if the market is disappointed with guidance. Businesses are currently spending heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, but spending could slow if return on investment (ROI) metrics fail to impress. Bank of America analysts recently wrote, \"End-user companies and their investors will soon look for revenue to justify the [money] already spent.\"\nHowever, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress plans to share ROI metrics on the upcoming earnings. That implies the company is not only aware that investors are concerned about the sustainability of AI spending, but also that it has encouraging data that could allay those concerns. It seems unlikely that Nvidia would tout ROI data under other circumstances.\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs have a similar outlook. In a recent note, they expressed confidence the AI spending cycle is sustainable and that Nvidia will hold its \"leadership position through consistent and rapid innovation across compute, networking, and software.\" The analysts also think Nvidia will beat consensus estimates when it announces second-quarter results.\nThat brings me to a third problem. Even if Nvidia beats estimates and provides convincing data about the sustainability of AI spending, the stock may still decline simply because investors take profits. Remember, Nvidia beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, but the stock did not always move higher on the news. Listed below is the price action on the trading day following the last four earnings reports.\nQ2 2024: The stock increased 0.1% on August 23, 2023.\nQ3 2024: The stock declined 2.5% on November 22, 2023.\nQ4 2024: The stock increased 16.4% on February 22, 2024.\nQ1 2025: The stock increased 9.3% on May 23, 2024.\nRegarding the upcoming report, pricing data from the options market implies post-earnings share price volatility of 11%. In other words, options investors believe Nvidia stock could rise or fall by as much as 11% on Aug. 29. That figure is subject to change with each trading day between now and then.\nInvestors interested in owning Nvidia stock should ignore the potential volatility surrounding its second-quarter report. Instead, they should focus on the long-term investment thesis and the current valuation.\nNvidia is the market leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), semiconductors that have become the industry standard in speeding up compute-intensive data center workloads like analytics and machine learning. As a result, Nvidia also dominates the market for AI accelerators. \"Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\nMoreover, Nvidia is well positioned to maintain its leadership because there are no good alternative to its CUDA platform, an ecosystem of software libraries and developer services that streamline data preparation, model training, and AI application development. Ben Colello at Morningstar recently wrote, \"We believe Nvidia not only has a hardware lead, but benefits from high customer switching costs around CUDA, making it unlikely for another GPU vendor to emerge as a leader in AI training.\"\nWith that in mind, Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow adjusted EPS at 51% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends January 2026). That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 62 times adjusted earnings look relatively reasonable. I say that because it gives Nvidia a PEG ratio of 1.2.\nFor context, using the same methodology, Microsoft currently carries a PEG ratio of 3, Arm Holdings has a PEG ratio of 4.1, and Palantir Technologies has a PEG ratio of 4.3. So the market is affording other AI companies higher valuation multiples. That does not mean Nvidia is cheap, but it does indicate that its current valuation is not an absurd deviation from other AI stocks.\nHere's the bottom line: Investors looking for guaranteed short-term gains should avoid Nvidia stock. The near-term outlook is clouded by high expectations and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of AI spending. But investors focused on long-term gains should consider buying a small position. If Nvidia shares slip after the second-quarter report, they can treat it as a buying opportunity and build a slightly larger position (within their comfort zones).\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) will announce its second quarter results after the closing bell rings on Wednesday, August 28, 2024. The semiconductor company topped consensus estimates with its last four reports, so Wall Street analysts may have inflated expectations. But there is another reason the stakes are particularly high this time around.\nNvidia shares have advanced 126% year to date, making it the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) behind Super Micro Computer. Investors are clearly excited about artificial intelligence (AI), perhaps too excited. Valuations are creeping higher and some experts think the \"AI bubble\" will burst in the not-too-distant future, at least temporarily.\nIn short, Nvidia shares could decline sharply following its second-quarter report on Aug. 28, either because the company misses estimates or because the market is nervous about the durability of AI spending. Is it safe to buy the stock right now?\nNvidia topped Wall Street's consensus revenue and earnings forecasts in each of the last four quarters. But the company beat estimates by increasingly small margins with each subsequent report. If that trend persists, Nvidia could miss expectations when it announces financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 on Aug. 28.\nThe chart below shows how Wall Street's consensus revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) forecasts compare to Nvidia's actual results last year.\nFinancial Metric\nQ2 2024 (Actual)\nQ2 2025 (Estimate)\nChange\nRevenue\n$13.5 billion\n$28.5 billion\n111%\nNon-GAAP EPS\n$0.27\n$0.64\n137%\nData Source: The Wall Street consensus as reported by Morgan Stanley.\nEven if Nvidia beats estimates, the stock could still decline following the report if the market is disappointed with guidance. Businesses are currently spending heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, but spending could slow if return on investment (ROI) metrics fail to impress. Bank of America analysts recently wrote, \"End-user companies and their investors will soon look for revenue to justify the [money] already spent.\"\nHowever, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress plans to share ROI metrics on the upcoming earnings. That implies the company is not only aware that investors are concerned about the sustainability of AI spending, but also that it has encouraging data that could allay those concerns.

        "Title": "Missed Out on Nvidia? Buy Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Instead",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Many investors have missed out on the incredible rise of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock. While most don't own it individually, a larger cohort owns it through index fund exposure. Many investors might be looking for the next Nvidia, but rises like that don't happen often.\nIf you've missed out on Nvidia, I'd propose another company worthy of an investment: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). The company is benefiting from the same wave that Nvidia is, but it's also more diversified and will be protected in the event of GPU demand falling (which has happened quite often throughout Nvidia's history).\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer. This means it takes designs from other businesses and manufactures them. This is no different than a standard machine shop or fabrication specialist; it just happens to be in the semiconductor realm.\nTSMC has stayed on top of the competition through its culture of continuous innovation, which has been evident by its consistent chip technology changes. Recently, 3nm (nanometer) chips quickly became a sizable chunk of TSMC's overall revenue (9% in the third quarter of 2024) despite entering production just in Q3 2023. These chips can be configured to be more powerful, more efficient, or both when compared to previous generations.\nDespite 3nm chips being relatively new to the market, TSMC is already working on its next generation: 2nm chips. These chips are expected to be available sometime in 2025, and the buzz surrounding them is already impressive. Management stated on its conference call that the demand for 2nm chips is already higher than that for 3nm or 5nm chip launches. This is likely because of the 2nm chips' focus on efficiency, which is a massive cost for companies creating artificial intelligence (AI) models with thousands of GPUs made by Nvidia.\nWith this game-changing product in the pipeline, investors have a great reason to hold the stock for the long term.\nAdditionally, management is seeing a huge demand for AI-related chips. Over the next five years, it forecasts this segment will grow revenue at a 50% compounded annual growth rate. When that growth is complete, AI chips will make up more than 20% of TSMC's revenue. That's massive growth and bodes well for its future.\nFor a more short-term growth driver, TSMC should see a huge boost from its largest customer: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Over the past three years, Apple has made up 26% (2021), 23% (2022), and 25% (2023) of its total revenue. However, Apple's smartphone sales have struggled because of its inability to launch a differentiating new feature. With the announcement of Apple Intelligence, that notion has changed. Because this feature will only be available on the latest generation of phones, it should ignite an upgrade cycle, which benefits TSMC immensely.\nThose compelling factors will drive TSMC's stock higher over the next few years; it should also see some financial improvement over the next few quarters.\nTSMC stock isn't nearly as cheap as it once was. Entering 2024, TSMC traded for a mere 15 times forward earnings.\nIts valuation has nearly doubled since then as investors have realized what a great price that was. Compared to Nvidia, which trades at 47 times forward earnings, TSMC does look like a bargain.However, that valuation should continue to come down as revenue rises over the next few quarters.\nTSMC has beaten analyst estimates over the past four quarters, so this forward multiple is likely a conservative valuation. Additionally, analysts expect earnings per share (EPS) to rise by 22% in 2024 and 26% in 2025, so its growth should support its valuation.\nAlthough it would be great to go back in time and buy Nvidia at the start of 2023, that isn't possible. Instead, I'd suggest investors pick up shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, as it benefits from similar trends yet trades at a more attractive valuation.\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 7 Best AI Value Stocks That are \u2018Money Machines\u2019 According to NYU\u2019s Aswath Damodaran.\u00a0Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nAswath Damodaran is a Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the \u201cvalue stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.\u201d\n\u201cWe look at the last year and a half, they\u2019ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap\u2026 just these seven companies. Just to give you perspective, the second-largest market in the world, China, has a market cap of $12.1 trillion. These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.\u201d\nDamodaran\u2019s comments are important because he\u2019s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued. In September, he said on CNBC that if you go through the list of top tech stocks, \u201cyou are more likely to be overvalued than undervalued.\u201d\nBut in his latest interview, Damodaran said that before we \u201cdismiss\u201d Mag. 7 stocks as \u201crisky tech companies,\u201d we should keep in mind that \u201cthese are the money machines in this market.\u201d\nHowever, when asked whether he believes we are not in any kind of \u201cdanger zone,\u201d the professor said we are in the danger zone not just in terms of these seven stocks, but the market overall.\nIn this article we take a look at the Mag 7. stocks and their AI-related growth catalysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\nAswath Damodoran has been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has \u201cno idea what I\u2019m talking about\u201d or it\u2019s the market that just does not understand.\nAswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the \u201cdriving seat\u201d of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won\u2019t be as easy as the market assumes.\nRecently, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.\nNVIDIA\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight. NVIDIA\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0shares have gained about 206% over the past one year.\nRecently, Barclays Tom O\u2019Malley gave bullish comments on the stock, with a $145 price target and an Overweight rating. The analyst pointed to a potential $25 billion opportunity from countries building up their AI capabilities. O\u2019Malley expects NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings at $3.62 per share in fiscal 2026, while Wall Street analysts on average have a $3.55 per share estimate for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings for 2026.\nNVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest product announcements and its plans revealed at the Computex 2024 show that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts like NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and think its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will start shipping H200 in the second half of this year. At its GTC conference NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed three accelerators \u2013 B200, GB200 and GB200 NVL72. All of these products provide growth catalysts for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares and justify its P/E multiple of 71, given NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth expectation of over 100% this year and 32% next year. Based on 2026 EPS estimate set by Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 35.74, which makes the stock\u2019s valuation attractive given the growth catalysts it has.\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system-on-a-chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. The company has experienced strong performance recently due to booming demand for its data center products, particularly those related to artificial intelligence. A major driver of Nvidia\u2019s recent success has been the growing adoption of its GPU accelerators for AI training and inference across various end markets. The company\u2019s GPUs have become an industry standard for training large language models (LLMs), and its networking solutions, such as NVLink and InfiniBand, are critical to maximizing the performance of AI systems. Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell GPU platform is expected to further extend its lead in the AI accelerator market, with significant performance and total cost of ownership benefits over its predecessors. As the AI market continues to expand with growing adoption across enterprises and sovereign nations, we expect Nvidia to maintain its dominance and experience sustained growth in its data center business. Beyond data centers, Nvidia has also benefited from strong demand in its gaming business, which has recovered after a period of inventory digestion in 2022. The company\u2019s gaming GPUs have been well-received, and its focus on the high-end market has supported growth in average selling prices.

        "Title": "Is Broadcom a Better Stock-Split Buy Than Nvidia? Wall Street Thinks So.",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights ",
        "Text": "It's a leader in technology that powers artificial intelligence (AI) models. Its revenue is soaring. Its shares have skyrocketed. It announced a 10-for-1 stock split this year.\nWhich stock am I talking about? There are two correct answers: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). However, Nvidia has been the bigger star of the two.\nBut could that change? Is Broadcom a better stock-split buy than Nvidia? Wall Street thinks so.\nNvidia has been a Wall Street darling for several years. It's fair to say now, though, that there's no longer a consensus about the high-flying AI stock.\nThree months ago, 54 of the 58 analysts surveyed by LSEG rated Nvidia as a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\" However, of the 38 analysts surveyed so far in July, only 21 still put the stock in one of those two categories. Fifteen analysts now rate Nvidia as a \"hold\" with two recommending investors sell the stock.\nThe average 12-month price target for Nvidia compiled by LSEG from 48 analysts is a little below the current share price. The most pessimistic analyst (admittedly an outlier) thinks the stock could plunge more than 60%.\nIt's a much better story for Broadcom. LSEG surveyed 29 analysts this month to get their take on the stock; 27 of them rated it as a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\" The remaining two analysts rate Broadcom as a \"hold.\"\nGranted, Wall Street doesn't think Broadcom will deliver the sizzling gains over the next 12 months that it has over the past year. However, the average price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of nearly 10%.\nWhat changed to make Wall Street more bullish about Broadcom than Nvidia? The simple answer is that Nvidia has become a victim of its own success.\nThe stock is up more than 160% so far in 2024. This impressive performance comes on the heels of a gain of nearly 240% last year. Many analysts think Nvidia's sales will continue to grow robustly, but this growth is already baked into the share price.\nNewStreet Research analyst Pierre Ferragu even downgraded Nvidia stock recently from a \"buy\" to \"neutral.\" He wrote to investors that he sees \"limited further upside\" for Nvidia after its tremendous returns over the last 18 months or so.\nMeanwhile, Broadcom's valuation remains relatively attractive despite its strong gains. The stock trades at 29 times forward earnings, well below Nvidia's forward earnings multiple of 49.\nI agree with analysts in some ways. Although Broadcom's valuation isn't exactly cheap, the company doesn't have to generate the dizzying level of growth that Nvidia must deliver to justify its premium price. You could argue that Broadcom is a lower-risk pick.\nIt wouldn't surprise me at all if Broadcom hits the average analysts' price target over the next 12 months (and probably sooner). The company should enjoy solid growth over the next few quarters from its VMware acquisition and demand for its AI accelerators.\nHowever, I'm not completely on the same page as Wall Street's views about Nvidia. I've been guilty in the past of underestimating the chipmaker's growth potential. My hunch is that Nvidia's launch of its new Blackwell platform in the coming months could go better than most analysts expect. If so, look for multiple rounds of upward price target revisions in the not-too-distant future.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $791,929!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "Can Nvidia Sustain Its AI-Fueled Surge as Stock Price Nears Record High?",
        "Author": "  Naomi Buchanan ",
        "Text": "\nNvidia stock rose again Wednesday, approaching the record high it set last month, as the chipmaker continues to benefit from investor enthusiasm about the company's strong position during the AI boom.\nThe continued ascent may raise questions about how the company's stock will sustain its record-breaking climb.\nTruist Securities analysts said that earnings growth driven by increased sales will be key to the stock maintaining its outperformance. They highlighted strong demand for AI chips and Nvidia's prime position as factors contributing to organic sales growth.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) shares rose again Wednesday, approaching the record high set last month, as the chipmaker continues to benefit from investor enthusiasm about the company's strong position during the artificial intelligence era.\nThe company's AI-fueled gain has sent it into the $3 trillion market capitalization club, an achievement only previously reached by Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), in record time. The question on the minds of many is: how can the company and stock sustain their monumental growth?\nAnalysts at Truist Securities, in a report released Wednesday, examined the question of \"how the biggest can get bigger,\" finding that earnings per share (EPS)\u00a0growth driven by increasing organic sales will likely be how Nvidia continues its rise.\nThe analysts highlighted how other mega market cap stocks, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN), They said that while these stocks suffered a contraction in price-to-earnings ratio, they \"still outperformed the S&P by delivering strong EPS growth.\"\nNvidia has consistently blown away investors' expectations on revenue and earnings in recent quarters.\nIn May, Nvidia reported record revenue of $26.04 billion for its fiscal 2025 first quarter, more than triple what it was in the year-ago period, while EPS came in at $5.98 compared to 82 cents. The top and bottom line numbers both easily surpassed analysts' estimates.\n\"We do have relative confidence that NVDA will continue to grow revenue (& EPS) organically faster than the S&P,\" the Truist analysts wrote in the new report.\nSurging demand for AI-related hardware could sustain Nvidia's performance.\nTruist analysts highlighted the near-term upside potential given that \"NVDA's supply chain is gearing up to deliver $150-200B of datacenter sales\" in 2025. Amid the ongoing AI boom, Nvidia has been unable to keep up with surging demand for its data center products.\nThe analysts said while \"AI server revenue growth is feverish (we estimate ~70% this year), unit growth is just getting going\" as it's still early in the AI era.\nAnother component that could support growth is Nvidia's shift to offering \"truly full stack solutions\" rather than simply chips as they did in the past. The analysts said they \"expect this dynamic was a major factor in NVDA's revenue & EPS acceleration\" over the last four quarters, and they \"expect that trend to continue.\"\nNvidia's upcoming Blackwell platform offers full-stack solutions, supporting the data center needs required to train and run AI workloads. Blackwell is already in high demand and is expected to drive the chipmaker's growth.\nThe analysts also noted that AI at the edge, where AI computing is done on-device rather than through a third-party server, could be \"a relatively overlooked area of AI adoption.\" They said that Nvidia's growth in the AI edge market could add another $100 billion market for the company.\nNvidia shares were up 2.5% at $134.72 in afternoon trading Wednesday, approaching their all-time closing high of $135.58 set on June 18. The stock has gained 172% so far in 2024.\nTradingView\nRead the original article on Investopedia.\n"

More specifically, Nvidia owns 3,727,033 shares of Serve's 37.1 million shares outstanding.\nServe Robotics stock continued its rise on Monday, with its 16.2% gain bringing its two-market-day surge to 233%.\nServe Robotics held its initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq on April 18, 2024, at $4 per share. Shares closed on Monday at $8.77, up from $2.63 on Thursday before the Nvidia news broke. Prior to its Nasdaq listing, Serve's stock had traded on the OTCQB, the over-the-counter market known as the \"Venture Market.\"\nShould you follow Nvidia's lead and buy Serve Robotics stock?\nServe Robotics \u2014 headquartered in California's Silicon Valley \u2014 was originally part of food-delivery company Postmates. In 2021, Serve was spun off from ride-hailing specialist Uber Technologies following Uber's 2020 acquisition of Postmates.\nServe Robotics develops and operates AI-powered, low-emissions sidewalk delivery robots that serve people in public spaces. The company currently focuses on last-mile food delivery in cities for enterprise partners. Serve's CEO has said the company eventually plans to expand into grocery, pharmacy, cannabis, and parcel delivery.\nIn 2020, Serve, which was then a team working for Postmates, launched its sidewalk delivery robots in Los Angeles during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns. By the end of that year, its robots had completed over 10,000 deliveries.\nAfter spinning off from Uber in 2021, Serve Robotics formed a partnership with Uber. In early 2022, it began deliveries for Uber on a small scale, and in June of the same year, the two companies signed an agreement for Serve to deploy up to 2,000 of its robots on the Uber Eats platform across multiple U.S. markets.\nServe's current fleet consists of over 100 robots, it said in a July SEC filing. The company has platform-level integrations with the Uber Eats division of Uber and convenience store chain 7-Eleven. It's also conducted pilots for Walmart, a major pizza quick-service restaurant, and a major coffee shop chain, according to the filing.\nIn late April, Serve expanded its existing agreement with Magna International, a leading automotive supplier. Under the new agreement, Magna became the exclusive contract manufacturer of Serve's delivery robots. In February, Serve had granted Magna a non-exclusive license to its technologies and expertise.\nAs of Monday's market close, Serve Robotics' market cap was $325 million, which makes its stock a small-cap stock.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the company's revenue was $946,711, up from $40,252 in the year-ago period. This big increase was due primarily to about $850,000 in revenue generated from the company's software services contract with Magna. It also had slightly more revenue from deliveries and branding.\nIts Q1 2024 net loss was $9 million, or $0.37 per share, compared with a net loss of $5.1 million, or $0.77 per share, in the year-ago quarter. (The loss per share decreased because of the increase in the number of shares.)\nFor the full year 2023, the company generated revenue of $207,545 and had a net loss of $24.8 million.\nLiquidity is often a huge concern for early-stage tech companies that are not profitable. Indeed, Serve Robotics used cash of $4.1 million running its operations in the first quarter, and ended the period with just $430,000 in cash and cash equivalents. The company's coffers got a much-needed injection of cash from its April IPO, which netted it cash of $35.7 million. That brought its cash and cash equivalent position up to about $36.1 million.\nHow long will that $36.1 million in cash last? It's not possible to estimate because the company said it planned to use some of the IPO cash to scale up its operations. So, investors can probably expect its cash-burn rate to increase. In other words, while it burned through cash of $4.1 million running its operations in Q1 (which equates to an annual operating cash-burn run rate of just over $16 million), this number will likely be higher in Q2 and beyond.\nServe Robotics stock is too risky for most investors. It's only suitable for folks comfortable with buying stock in start-ups that are likely to be unprofitable for a good number of years. Another notable risk factor is the company's high customer concentration. In Q1 2024, one customer accounted for 90% of Serve's revenue, it said in an SEC filing. It's safe to assume this customer is Uber.\nMore advanced robots are coming, thanks in large part to recent advances in AI. A solid way to invest in robotics is to buy Nvidia stock. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and related technology are being used for training and deploying autonomous machines of various types, including robots.\nIndeed, it's safe to assume that Serve Robotics is one such company using Nvidia's GPUs.

Qualcomm Inc., the world\u2019s biggest seller of smartphone processors, gave a strong revenue forecast. Treasury yields slipped alongside the dollar.\nIn a press conference, Powell said officials could cut rates \u201cas soon as\u201d September. And the Fed statement also brought quite a few language tweaks. Notably, the committee shifted to saying it is \u201cattentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate,\u201d rather than prior wording focused just on inflation.\n\u201cThe press conference is somewhat more dovish than the statement,\u201d said Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro Research. \u201cIt definitely sounds like they are just waiting for the sake of waiting.

A Bloomberg gauge of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d megacaps jumped 3.5%. The Russell 2000 of small firms added 0.5%.\nThe advance in bonds gained pace late in the day as Mideast tensions stoked flight-to-safety buying and spurred a rally in oil. Treasuries notched a third straight month of gains \u2014 the longest winning run since 2021. The yen rose as the Bank of Japan raised rates and announced plans to cut bond purchases.\n\u201cPowell has become increasingly adept at not showing all of his cards,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance. \u201cUltimately, the market is counting on the rate-cutting cycle beginning in September \u2013 despite how many times Powell tried to keep the Fed\u2019s options open.\u201d\nThe changes in the Fed statement solidify a shift in tone among several policymakers, including Powell, recognizing growing risks to the labor market. They are also likely to reinforce expectations among economists and investors for a rate cut at the central bank\u2019s Sept. 17-18 gathering.\n\u201cPowell so wants to say today \u2018let\u2019s do it\u2019 \u2014 but at the same time, he knows he doesn\u2019t have to commit just yet before he gets more time and data,\u201d said Peter Boockvar at the Boock Report.\nTo Ronald Temple at Lazard, the Fed \u201chas clearly telegraphed\u201d a September interest-rate cut.\n\u201cWhile I believe a July rate cut could have been justified by slowing inflation, easing labor market tightness, and moderating growth, I think the case will be even more compelling in seven weeks,\u201d he noted.\nSwap traders are still fully pricing in a quarter point cut in September \u2014 and a total of almost 70 basis points worth of reductions for the year.\nGiven markets were already fully priced for a September cut, neither the Fed\u2019s statement nor Powell\u2019s remarks dramatically changed the rate path into the bond market, said Tiffany Wilding at Pacific Investment Management Co.\n\u201cThe data has moved in Powell\u2019s direction and now he\u2019s getting ready to follow,\u201d said David Russell at TradeStation. \u201cJobs data on Friday and CPI in two weeks are the next big items.

That brought its cash and cash equivalent position up to about $36.1 million.\nHow long will that $36.1 million in cash last? It's not possible to estimate because the company said it planned to use some of the IPO cash to scale up its operations. So, investors can probably expect its cash-burn rate to increase. In other words, while it burned through cash of $4.1 million running its operations in Q1 (which equates to an annual operating cash-burn run rate of just over $16 million), this number will likely be higher in Q2 and beyond.\nServe Robotics stock is too risky for most investors. It's only suitable for folks comfortable with buying stock in start-ups that are likely to be unprofitable for a good number of years. Another notable risk factor is the company's high customer concentration. In Q1 2024, one customer accounted for 90% of Serve's revenue, it said in an SEC filing. It's safe to assume this customer is Uber.\nMore advanced robots are coming, thanks in large part to recent advances in AI. A solid way to invest in robotics is to buy Nvidia stock. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and related technology are being used for training and deploying autonomous machines of various types, including robots.\nIndeed, it's safe to assume that Serve Robotics is one such company using Nvidia's GPUs.

Qualcomm Inc., the world\u2019s biggest seller of smartphone processors, gave a strong revenue forecast. Treasury yields slipped alongside the dollar.\nIn a press conference, Powell said officials could cut rates \u201cas soon as\u201d September. And the Fed statement also brought quite a few language tweaks. Notably, the committee shifted to saying it is \u201cattentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate,\u201d rather than prior wording focused just on inflation.\n\u201cThe press conference is somewhat more dovish than the statement,\u201d said Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro Research. \u201cIt definitely sounds like they are just waiting for the sake of waiting. After all, by his own admission, all the data are already pointing in the direction he wants to see!\u201d\nA $563 billion exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500 (ticker: SPY) climbed 1.6%.

A Bloomberg gauge of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d megacaps jumped 3.5%. The Russell 2000 of small firms added 0.5%.\nThe advance in bonds gained pace late in the day as Mideast tensions stoked flight-to-safety buying and spurred a rally in oil. Treasuries notched a third straight month of gains \u2014 the longest winning run since 2021. The yen rose as the Bank of Japan raised rates and announced plans to cut bond purchases.\n\u201cPowell has become increasingly adept at not showing all of his cards,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance. \u201cUltimately, the market is counting on the rate-cutting cycle beginning in September \u2013 despite how many times Powell tried to keep the Fed\u2019s options open.\u201d\nThe changes in the Fed statement solidify a shift in tone among several policymakers, including Powell, recognizing growing risks to the labor market. They are also likely to reinforce expectations among economists and investors for a rate cut at the central bank\u2019s Sept. 17-18 gathering.\n\u201cPowell so wants to say today \u2018let\u2019s do it\u2019 \u2014 but at the same time, he knows he doesn\u2019t have to commit just yet before he gets more time and data,\u201d said Peter Boockvar at the Boock Report.\nTo Ronald Temple at Lazard, the Fed \u201chas clearly telegraphed\u201d a September interest-rate cut.\n\u201cWhile I believe a July rate cut could have been justified by slowing inflation, easing labor market tightness, and moderating growth, I think the case will be even more compelling in seven weeks,\u201d he noted.\nSwap traders are still fully pricing in a quarter point cut in September \u2014 and a total of almost 70 basis points worth of reductions for the year.\nGiven markets were already fully priced for a September cut, neither the Fed\u2019s statement nor Powell\u2019s remarks dramatically changed the rate path into the bond market, said Tiffany Wilding at Pacific Investment Management Co.\n\u201cThe data has moved in Powell\u2019s direction and now he\u2019s getting ready to follow,\u201d said David Russell at TradeStation. \u201cJobs data on Friday and CPI in two weeks are the next big items.

        "Title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Why Is Ken Fisher Bullish on This Growth Stock Right Now?",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of Ken Fisher\u2019s Top 10 Growth Stock Picks with 30+% Revenue Growth. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other growth stocks.\nGrowth is the holy grail of investing. After all, equities attract investors because they are return driven securities, and securities that deliver growth often produce the strongest returns. Growth, in stock valuation, comes in several flavors. The most commonly analyzed metric is share price growth, which evaluates the percentage change in the share price over a time period.\nOther growth valuations come through earnings growth or revenue growth. Among these, earnings is the more commonly evaluated metric as it determines the profitability of a company. These profits are key for growth stocks since the post net income 'money' on a firm's income statement is either paid out in the form of dividends or reinvested in growth if it isn't accounted for as retained earnings. The market generally prices stocks that are expected to aggressively grow in the future high compared to their earnings in the form of the P/E ratio.\nThe other ratio for evaluating growth stocks is the price to sales or P/S ratio. And this is where Ken Fisher enters the conversation. Fisher is one of the richest people in the world, with estimates from Forbes Magazine showing that his net worth stood at $11.2 billion as of July 2024. At the heart of Fisher's riches is his investment fund Fisher Investments. The total value of the fund's 13F holdings as reflected by its SEC filings for the first quarter of 2024 is $214 billion according to Insider Monkey's research. This makes Fisher Investments one of the biggest financial firms in the world, and its investment approach as evidenced by some of the biggest stakes in the filings is characterized by investing in high growth technology companies.\nFisher started his firm in 1979 and focused on gaining an early foothold on market participants by sifting out information that was not widely available to investors. On the quantitative front, the P/S ratio was also quite critical to his approach and we'll get to that in a bit. Over the next two decades, his firm would focus on investing in pure play US equities, global equities, and exUS or foreign equities. The firm would focus its investment products towards high net worth individuals in the 1990s, and from 2000 onwards, it would expand its presence in the UK, Canada, and Germany. Fisher Investments now has 15 offices in 16 countries and more than a hundred thousand clients worldwide as of July 2024.\nShifting gears to focus on the firm's performance, data from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) shows that data for 76 funds managed by Fisher Investments is available. Within these, the fund that invests for retirement plans has gained 19.18% year to date and 18.77% over the past year. Compared to the benchmark S&P index, the year to date performance is two percentage points higher while the 12 month performance lags the index by three percentage points. Another fund that targets US equities irrespective of capitalization is up by 24% over the past twelve months to lead the benchmark by three percentage points. In daily trailing total returns, this fund has delivered 14.39% over the past six months to lead benchmark US large cap equity returns of 11.36% by three percentage points.\nSafe to say, Fisher's strategies and secret sauce seem to be working. This then leads us to ask, what might they be? Well, in the 70s when Fisher was starting Fisher Investments, he started to focus on evaluating a firm's market valuation relative to its revenue through the P/S ratio. This culminated in his seminal article in the American Association of Individual Investors. (AAII) in 1984. This paper highlighted Fisher's conviction of a solid approach to sift out growth stocks, and his research showed that stocks with low price to sales ratios tended to do rather well as they were unpopular and any good news \"translates directly into higher stock prices.\" He compared the stocks with the lowest 25% price to sales and price to earnings ratio to demonstrate that the seven and nine stocks with the lowest price to sales ratios delivered 64.57% and 56.11% in respective returns while the nine lowest P/E stocks delivered 28.67% in returns. During the same time, the Dow posted a gain of 20.3%.\nSince multiples that use growth rates are typically used to value growth stocks, particularly those that are unprofitable, they are quite sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and particularly inflation and high interest rates. Another popular revenue based growth stock valuation metric is the Enterprise Value/Revenue ratio and it is popular for valuing software as a service (SaaS) stocks. After the coronavirus pandemic hit, the Fed rapidly cut interest rates to stimulate the economy and this translated well for EV/Revenue. Before the rate cuts, the median EV/Revenue for publicly traded SaaS stocks was 11 and after the cuts, it soared and nearly doubled to sit at 20 in 2021.\nSimilarly, the interest rate hikes of 2022 and high inflation that led to tight business budgets didn't fare well for EV/Revenue. Since high interest rates also make it difficult for firms to finance their business operations, and high inflation leads to rising costs, SaaS firms face twice the impact in the form of lower revenue. This is also translated into their EV/Revenue multiples, as for the last 18 months, the median multiple was 7 which is at a multi year low. The lower multiples are accompanied by dropping growth rates, as while the pre pandemic median revenue growth rate of SaaS companies was 30% and accelerated to 33% during the pandemic, it has since dropped and is hovering around 17%.\nSo, as growth slows down and multiples struggle, it might be wise to see what the guru of growth Ken Fisher is doing. We've done so today so read more below.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Ken Fisher's top revenue growth stocks, we scanned Fisher Investments' Q1 2024 SEC filings and ranked the top 160 holdings by their three year annualized revenue growth. Out of these, the top ten Ken Fisher stocks with the highest revenue growth were chosen.\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 186\n3 Yr Revenue Growth: 54%\nFisher Investments' Q1 2024 Stake: $8.2 billion\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is Wall Street's AI darling, and the love is also shown here in this list as it is Ken Fisher's second biggest growth stock pick. The firm's rise to fame is built on its strong competitive advantage through its GPU products and CUDA software. Combined, these two are among the best performing products in the world, and given industry expectations for AI related upgrades, they offer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) a wide moat over peers. At the same time, these are also its biggest risks since businesses like to have a diverse supply chain, and rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China have led to, and might lead to more, significant export embargoes. The former was evident in July 2024 when a media report claimed that OpenAI and Sam Altman were eager to develop their own products to reduce dependence on NVIDIA, with Taiwan's TSMC also purportedly showing willingness to allocate chip capacity for them.\nBaron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\"We are early on the adoption S-curve \u2013 most companies are still in the proof of concept stage while very few are ready for production today. Hurdles in implementing AI include data prep, model adaptation and fine-tuning, and embedding of AI into existing workflows. There is a lot of innovation taking place to reducing these hurdles \u2013 from tools and infrastructure that help companies build and run AI models more easily, to third-party AI models exposed via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable companies to use them without building their own models from scratch. NVIDIA\u2019s ecosystem across developers, system integrators, cloud providers and independent software vendors, and internal software innovation are lowering these hurdles as well. For example, one of the most interesting announcements at the GTC conference were NVIDIA Inference Microservices \u2013 or NIMs, which are APIs to easily access open-source models (NVIDIA already has dozens of models available) without the need to worry about model optimizations, security, patching, or sending data to third parties. NIMs could ease AI adoption for enterprises while also driving incremental monetization for NVIDIA, priced at $4,500/GPU or at $1/GPU hour if used on the cloud, and increase the stickiness of NVIDIA\u2019s platform.\"\nOverall NVDA ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of Ken Fisher's top 10 growth stocks picks. You can visit Ken Fisher\u2019s Top 10 Growth Stock Picks with 30+% Revenue Growth\u00a0to see the other growth stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The capital markets have gotten off to a sizzling start in 2024. The S&P 500 has soared roughly 16.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has notched a 20% gain.\nOne of the biggest themes fueling buying activity in the markets right now is hype around artificial intelligence (AI). And while AI comes in many forms, semiconductor stocks have been particularly big beneficiaries of the AI revolution.\nPerhaps the biggest name among chip stocks is Nvidia, which has returned 127% so far in 2024.\nAlthough Nvidia makes for a tempting buy, investors may be better off looking at alternatives.\nLet's dig into why investors need not panic if they feel like they've missed the Nvidia train, and explore why the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) could be a better option in the long run.\nOne of the best ways to invest in the capital markets is through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs are unique vehicles because they are composed of individual stocks, thereby providing investors with a high degree of diversification.\nThe fund currently holds 26 positions in different chip stocks. By owning the VanEck Semiconductor ETF, investors automatically gain exposure to quality opportunities in the AI chip space, such as Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and Micron Technology.\nOn the surface, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF provides investors with a mechanism to own a variety of different chip stocks. But the more subtle trade-off is that investors also acquire an exposure to different end markets within the chip space in general.\nIn other words, while each chip stock mentioned above is related in some form or fashion, many of them operate in different capacities. This means that VanEck Semiconductor ETF provides investors with an additional layer of diversification and even more exposure to the broader AI industry than initially realized.\nAnother reason why investing passively through an ETF could be superior to owning individual stocks is that it inherently makes portfolio management a lot easier.\nWhen you own individual stocks, it's generally a good idea to dial into earnings calls and listen to management's commentary about the business. Moreover, keeping a keen eye on the company's growth, expense management, and profitability trends can be helpful when determining if you want to change your position in the stock.\nThe main problem here is that this type of analysis requires a good deal of time and an astute understanding of financial analysis.\nAs it relates to semiconductors, in particular, there is a pretty big risk that investors should be aware of. Namely, chip businesses tend to be cyclical.\nRight now, semiconductors are in high demand thanks to the booming interest surrounding AI-powered applications.\nHowever, these demand trends will eventually be curtailed. As a result, companies such as Nvidia and its cohorts will likely experience some deceleration in revenue and profits. When this occurs, there's a good chance that Nvidia and other stocks will witness some sell-offs.\nOwning the VanEck Semiconductor ETF mitigates this risk. Although the fund is widely exposed to chip businesses, professional money managers are responsible for monitoring trends among semiconductor businesses and updating allocations in the ETF on an appropriate basis.\nFor these reasons, I think the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has a good chance of outperforming most individual stocks in the AI space or chip industry over the long run.\nThe chart below illustrates the total return of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF over the last 10 years.\nClearly the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has largely outperformed the S&P 500. However, it's important to call out the slope of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF's return since 2022. Considering AI has become the tech sector's newest shiny object over the last 18 months or so, it's not entirely surprising to see the gains in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF climb so steeply in a relatively short time frame.\nAnother important note to call out is that with an expense ratio of just 0.35%, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is far more reasonable than other tech-focused index funds. For example, the Invesco Semiconductors ETF\u00a0boasts a management fee of 0.57%, while the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF has an expense ratio of 0.60%.\nConsidering its strong historical returns, deep level of diversification, and reasonable management fees, I think the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is a great option for investors looking for a healthy exposure to top quality chip stocks as well as the AI industry more broadly.\nBefore you buy stock in VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney\nAUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Inside Amazon.com's chip lab in Austin, Texas, half a dozen engineers on a Friday afternoon put a closely guarded new server design through its paces.\nThe server was packed with Amazon's artificial intelligence chips that compete with those from market leader Nvidia, Amazon executive Rami Sinno said on Friday, during a visit to the lab.\nAmazon is developing its own processors to limit its reliance on costly Nvidia chips - the so-called Nvidia tax - that power some of the artificial intelligence cloud business at its Amazon Web Services, the main growth driver.\nThrough its homegrown chips, Amazon wants to help customers compute complex calculations and process enormous amounts of data more cheaply.\nIts rivals Microsoft and Alphabet are doing the same.\nSinno, the director of engineering for Amazon's Annapurna Labs that is a part of its cloud business AWS, said Amazon's customers were increasingly demanding cheaper alternatives to Nvidia.\nAmazon bought Annapurna labs in 2015.\nWhile the company's AI chip efforts are nascent, Amazon's workhorse chip Graviton that performs non-AI computing has been under development for nearly a decade and is on its fourth generation. The AI chips, Trainium and Inferentia, are newer designs.\n\"So the offering of up to 40%, 50% in some cases of improved price (and) performance - so it should be half as expensive as running that same model with Nvidia,\" David Brown, Vice President, Compute and Networking at AWS said on Tuesday.\nSales at AWS, which accounts for just under a fifth of Amazon's overall revenue, surged 17% to $25 billion in the January-March quarter, compared with a year earlier. AWS controls roughly a third of the cloud computing market, with Microsoft's Azure holding about 25%.\nDuring its recent Prime Day, Amazon deployed a quarter million Graviton chips and 80,000 of its custom AI chips to handle the surge in activity across its platforms, the company said.\nThe shopping event generated a record $14.2 billion in sales, according to Adobe Analytics.\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "Text": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\nPiper Sandler analysts on Monday reaffirmed an Overweight rating for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and raised their target price from $120 to $140 in a move driven by strong expectations ahead of the company's earnings report for the July quarter and guidance for the October quarter.\n\"We see the strong business trends exhibited over the prior year by NVDA set to continue aided by the official launch of the Blackwell architecture in the October quarter,\" the analysts wrote.\nThe investment bank views the launch of the Blackwell architecture as a catalyst for a new phase of growth, anticipating continued strong demand from cloud service providers (CSPs), enterprises, and sovereign entities. Analysts believe that demand for NVIDIA's upcoming B100/B200 products will significantly outpace supply.\nIn its bullish scenario, Piper Sandler says NVDA could exceed expectations by more than $2 billion in reported revenue for the July quarter, thanks to a recovery in networking supply.\n\"In our view, NVDA continues to be a premier player in the accelerated compute and gen AI end market,\" the analysts added.\nSimilarly, Loop Capital analysts increased their price target for Nvidia stock from $120 to $175, citing the company's potential to significantly exceed consensus revenue and earnings estimates for fiscal 2026.\nWells Fargo analysts have identified Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as the \"most favored long among mega-caps\" as the tech giant approaches its second-quarter earnings report.\nDespite mixed hedge fund positioning for competitors like Meta (NASDAQ:META), Wells Fargo believes Amazon stands out due to strong performance expectations and positive forward commentary.\nThe bank's analysts predict an 18% increase in Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue for the second quarter, with a sufficient operating income (OI) guidance of $16 billion for the third quarter.\nWells Fargo also plans to closely monitor Amazon's air freight commentary, estimating its impact on third-quarter operating income to be in the $200-$400 million range.\n\"See AMZN as the most favored long among mega-caps vs. META with more mixed HF positioning,\" the analysts stated, highlighting strong investor sentiment towards Amazon.\nThey note that the upcoming second-quarter earnings reports will be critical for understanding CapEx allocation and return time frames, especially given potential changes in AI strategy at AWS following the recent CEO change.\nRaymond James analysts have raised their stock price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $250 from $200, describing the company as \"a more stable AI play for volatile times.\" The firm maintained an Outperform rating on the stock, expecting a slight beat in F3Q24 results and an outlook in line with previous expectations.\nThis optimism is based on recent conversations in the Asia supply chain, TSM results, and China CAICT data, all indicating positive near-term trends for iPhone and Mac sales.\n\"We expect a slight beat and largely in-line outlook,\" the analysts wrote.\nWhile near-term results may not significantly impact the AI narrative, Raymond James remains \"optimistic that upcoming AI features will drive a multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle.\"\nThe firm pointed to upward revisions in iPhone 16 builds for the second half of 2024, based on supply chain conversations, and mentioned significant changes to the internals of the iPhone 17, indicating Apple's increased focus on enhancing on-device AI capabilities.\n\"Supply chain data also points to material changes to iPhone 17 internals, suggesting that Apple is looking to do more AI on the device,\" analysts noted.\nApple's unique position in offering on-device AI features stems from its strong ecosystem, advanced hardware capabilities, and a focus on privacy.\n\"We believe Apple is in a unique position to offer on-device AI features given its ecosystem strength, hardware capabilities, and privacy focus,\" the note added.\nEarlier in the week, Baird analysts added Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock as a \u201cBullish Fresh Pick\u201d and increased their target price on the stock to $250.\nThis revision follows Baird\u2019s initial channel feedback, which revealed a procurement units estimate of over 90 million for the upcoming iPhone 16, a significant rise from the low 80 million units of previous iPhone launches.\n\u201cSimilar to the Galaxy S24 launch earlier this year, AI is the driver,\u201d analysts noted.\nThey expect strengthening demand trends in Qualcomm's handset business in the third quarter of the calendar year, following a seasonal trough in the second quarter and a year-over-year comparison trough in the first quarter.\nBaird\u2019s team believes that AI will drive double-digit increases in Qualcomm's average selling prices (ASPs) for various components, starting with the iPhone 16 in the second half of this year. Moreover, initial AI content in high-end phones from Chinese smartphone OEMs will contribute, followed by the next-generation Galaxy platform in the first half of 2025.\nRadio Frequency (RF) ASP and content are also expected to benefit from AI beginning in the second half, driven by higher performance, faster uplinks, and greater integration.\nAdditionally, the investment firm pointed out a strong initial response for Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processor in South Korea, as the chipmaker is the first to market in the initial wave of AI in PCs.\nSamsung (KS:005930) has launched Copilot+ PCs based on the X Elite, with demand surpassing initial channel expectations. Besides Samsung, the X Elite is also currently being shipped by HP (NYSE:HPQ), Dell (NYSE:DELL), Acer, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Lenovo.\n\u201cWe would be buyers of QCOM shares on recent share pullback,\u201d the analysts concluded.\nUBS analysts have reiterated their Sell rating on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), citing substantial downside risk due to overvaluation and challenges in the automotive business highlighted in its latest quarterly report.\nThey believe Tesla's stock, which is currently trading at over 100 times its run-rate EPS of approximately $2.25, has a considerable amount of AI optionality already priced in, resulting in an inflated valuation.\n\"TSLA 2Q24 results showed the stress on the automotive business, just to keep vehicle deliveries ~1.78mm annualized units (which would be -2% y/y),\" analysts noted.\nThe bank pointed out that Tesla's aggressive pricing and promotional strategies to stimulate demand have caused its auto gross margin, excluding credits, to drop to 14.6%, the lowest since the first quarter of 2019.\nAdjusting for higher-than-normal credits and restructuring charges, UBS estimates Tesla's run-rate EPS to be around $0.56, which still includes a strong but potentially volatile quarter for its Energy business.\nLooking ahead, analysts are skeptical about the near-term drivers for Tesla's earnings. While the introduction of a new lower-cost model and increased Full Self-Driving (FSD) take rates could provide some support, the analysts argue that even an improvement of $1 per share in earnings would still leave the stock trading at over 75 times its price-to-earnings ratio.\nThe analysts assert that Tesla's current stock price heavily relies on future AI initiatives such as robo-taxis and Optimus humanoid robots.\nThey believe Tesla's stock faces more downside risk if confidence in these AI initiatives wavers. Upcoming events like Robo-taxi day on October 10 could trigger a \"sell-the-news\" reaction, emphasizing the overvaluation of the stock based on uncertain future opportunities, analysts explained.\nRelated Articles\n5 big analyst AI moves: PT hikes for Nvidia, Apple; Tesla downside risk flagged\nWhat are the best trades to position for a red wave in the US election?\nWould the US outperform if Trump wins a clean sweep?\n"

Reasons they give include the sky-high potential for AI, and the prospect of a positive surprise in this month\u2019s earnings.\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded its stock-price target to 290,000 won ($210) on Tuesday, implying a potential gain of 25% from that day\u2019s close. Citigroup Inc. last week raised its prediction to 350,000 won, about 50% higher than the current share price.\n\u201cThe current share valuation isn\u2019t fully reflecting the potential of high-bandwidth memory chips,\u201d said Roh Jongwon, chief investment officer at Infinity Global Asset Management Co. in Seoul. \u201cThe market is treating HBM\u2019s valuation the same as traditional memory chips, but HBM is almost twice as profitable.\u201d\nSK Hynix will report a second-quarter operating profit of 5 trillion won, the most in six years, when it announces earnings on July 26, according to the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would continue its turnaround from last year\u2019s losses amid a recovery in memory-chip prices helped by demand for high-end devices for AI applications.\nSK Hynix shares rose 2.6% on Friday after Samsung Electronics Co. posted its fastest pace of sales and profit growth in years.\nCiti arrived at its 350,000 won price target \u2014 the most bullish among analysts\u2019 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg \u2014 by taking previous peaks in SK Hynix stock and adding some discount, said Peter Lee, head of global tech and communication at Citigroup Global Markets Korea Securities Ltd.\nDemand for HBM may not be fully reflected yet as the world is unfamiliar with the potential of AI, Lee said, citing the earlier introduction of smart phones. \u201cBecause this is a market that didn\u2019t exist in the past, we have never seen how far it can go.\u201d\nGetting Expensive\nStill, some investors say there\u2019s reason to be cautious as multiples head higher. SK Hynix is now trading at 2.9 times book value, making it the most expensive since at least 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cWe have entered uncharted territory in terms of the valuation,\u201d said Yoon Joonwon, a fund manager at DS Asset Management Co. in Seoul. \u201cI think its earnings will beat market expectations this year and next year, but the markets are still uncertain about that.\u201d\nInvestors are also getting jittery.\nSK Hynix shares sank as much as 4.7% Thursday following local media reports that Samsung will soon enter talks with Nvidia to supply the US company with its own version of HBM chips. Samsung later denied the reports.\nThere are also concerns about a potential oversupply of memory chips after SK Hynix on June 30 announced a $75 billion investment plan through 2028. Increasing output may depress chip prices and raise the specter of a downturn in the memory industry.\n\u201cBecause this is an untrodden path, volatility is inevitable,\u201d Citigroup\u2019s Lee said.\n--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein and Tan Hwee Ann.\n(Updates share gain in headline, lede, also SK Hynix trading in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving\nLooser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom\nPsychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch\nHow to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era\nThe First Porsche 911 Hybrid Is $165,000 Carrera GTS: Review\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Vice President Simona Jankowski is becoming chief financial officer at Lightmatter Inc., joining a chip startup that\u2019s angling to become part of the artificial intelligence computing boom.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSupreme Court Says Trump Has Some Immunity, Delaying Trial\n24-Hour Stock Trading Is Booming \u2013 and Wall Street Is Rattled\nBlackRock Buys Preqin for $3.2 Billion in Private Data Push\nTrump as President or Private Citizen: Why Supreme Court\u2019s Immunity Ruling Is a Test\nFrance\u2019s Market Rally Falters as Investors See Enduring Risk\nJankowski is taking the role after a nearly seven-year stint at Nvidia, where she oversaw investor relations and strategic finance. Prior to that, she was a longtime chip analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The executive announced last month that she was leaving Nvidia.\nJankowski said that she hadn\u2019t been looking to depart Nvidia, one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, until Lightmatter came along. The Mountain View, California-based startup is attempting to shake up the computing world by letting chips communicate with light, potentially making them faster and more efficient.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just about the only opportunity that I would have left Nvidia for,\u201d she said in an interview.\nLightmatter is trying to broaden the use of a technology called silicon photonics, which replaces traditional copper wire connections with optical linkages. The approach has long been seen as promising, but it hasn\u2019t gone mainstream yet because of the difficulty of manufacturing the components at scale.\nAccording to co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Nick Harris, Lightmatter has \u201cincredible market traction\u201d and its products will soon make an appearance in some of the world\u2019s largest data centers. The company works with other chipmakers, offering parts that link their products. He declined to identify the users of its technology.\nLightmatter is well-funded, having raised roughly half a billion dollars from investors such as GV, the firm formerly known as Google Ventures, Harris said in an interview. It\u2019s close to having enough money coming in to be self-sustaining but will take advantage of available capital to prioritize growth, he said.\nThe company, founded in 2017, is on course to be much bigger than Mellanox Technologies, a computer networking company that Nvidia bought in 2020 for roughly $7 billion, he argued. Lightmatter raised $155 million last year at a $1.2 billion valuation.\nHarris said the company enlisted Jankowski because of her mixture of technical knowledge and financial and planning skills.\nLike Jankowski\u2019s most recent employer, Lightmatter believes that the use of artificial intelligence software is sparking a wholesale change in the computing industry. The massive size of new processors needed to develop AI software \u2014 along with the amount of data and energy required \u2014 mean greater efficiency is a necessity.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before\nJapan\u2019s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back\nOnline Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America\nRTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found\nThe FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Anton Shilov ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nAccording to a report from Morgan Stanley cited by United Daily News, Nvidia and its partners will charge roughly $2 million to $3 million per AI server cabinet equipped with Nvidia's upcoming\u00a0Blackwell GPUs. The industry will need tens of thousands of AI servers in 2025, and their aggregate cost will exceed $200 billion.\nSo far, Nvidia has introduced two 'reference' AI server cabinets based on its Blackwell architecture: the NVL36, equipped with 36 B200 GPUs, which is expected to cost from $2 million ($1.8 million, according to previous reports), and the NVL72, with 72 B200 GPUs, which is projected to start at $3 million.\nNVL36 and NVL72 server cabinets (or PODs) will be available not only from Nvidia itself as well as its traditional partners, such as Foxconn, the world's largest supplier of AI servers, Quanta, and Wistron but also from newcomers, such as Asus. Assuming that Nvidia's partner TSMC can produce enough B100 and B200 GPUs using its 4nm-class lithography process technology and packaged using its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) technology, availability from newcomers should ease the tight supply of actual Blackwell-based machines.\nBased on the UDN report citing Morgan Stanley, Nvidia anticipates shipping between 60,000 and 70,000 B200 server cabinets, each priced between $2 million and $3 million next year. It translates to an estimated annual revenue of at least $210 billion from these machines, which means that companies like AWS and Microsoft will spend even more. It brings us to math by Sequoia Capital partner David Cahn, who believes that the AI industry has to earn around\u00a0$600 billion to pay off machines and data centers.\nDemand for AI servers is setting records and will not slow down any time soon, which will benefit both makers of AI servers and developers of AI GPUs. Despite the influx of competitors, Nvidia's GPUs are set to remain the de facto standard for training and many inference workloads, which benefits the company.\nBased on talks with industry sources, the same Morgan Stanley report revealed that international giants such as Amazon Web Services, Dell, Google, Meta, and Microsoft will all adopt Nvidia's Blackwell GPU for AI servers. As a result, demand is now projected to exceed expectations, so Nvidia is prompted to increase its orders with TSMC by approximately 25%, the report claims.\n"

In fact, in the first quarter of this year, he reduced his position in Nvidia by 68% to about 1.1 million shares. And at the same time, he increased his holding of another AI stock by more than 500%. Does this mean that, like Griffin, you should forget Nvidia and bet on this AI player? Let's find out.\nFirst, it's important to note investors have a pretty good reason for following Griffin's path. Since launching Citadel back in 1990, Griffin has built the fund to $63 billion in investment capital today. And Citadel has scored recognition as the most profitable hedge fund ever. So, when Griffin makes a particular bet on a stock, it's worth taking note \u2014 and in some instances, you may decide to follow.\nNow let's consider the billionaire's latest move. The hedge fund giant increased his position in Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) by more than 500% to about 295,000 shares, a clear sign of confidence in this AI company. Griffin has probably already started to win from this move since the stock has advanced about 35% so far this year.\nAnd the company completed a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this month, offering current holders additional shares to lower the per-share price of its stock. This doesn't change the value of Griffin's holding \u2014 or yours if you're a Broadcom shareholder \u2014 but it does offer shareholders a greater number of shares. A stock split is generally positive for a stock over time as it allows a wider range of investors to more easily buy it.\nWe don't know the exact reason why Griffin decided to increase his holding of Broadcom in the triple digits, but there's a lot of evidence showing Broadcom could be an AI winner down the road. In the most recent quarter, the semiconductor and networking giant said AI revenue surged 280% to more than $3.1 billion. Demand from mega-scale data centers for AI networking and custom accelerators is driving this growth, the company says.\nAs these data centers, or hyperscalers, continue to expand, Broadcom is seeing more and more growth in its networking business. The company doubled the number of switches it sold in the quarter year over year and now is developing next-generation switches and optics that should drive a new wave of growth.\nBroadcom is optimistic about this growth continuing, and considering forecasts for the AI market, there's reason for investors to be confident about the company's future too. Today's $200 billion AI market is set to reach more than $1 trillion later this decade. It's important to remember that right now more than 99% of Internet traffic travels through a Broadcom technology \u2014 so the company, as a leader, is well positioned to benefit from the AI boom.\nOn top of this, Broadcom also is seeing growth from its acquisition of cloud software company VMware. In fact, it predicts VMWare will help drive a 42% increase in annual revenue this year to about $51 billion.\nSo, is it time to forget Nvidia and turn to Broadcom? It's important to note that the companies could be considered rivals or peers because they are both chipmakers. But, while Nvidia is more focused on serving data centers with chips and other related products and services, Broadcom's business covers a lot more territory. The company makes thousands of products used not only in data centers but also in home connectivity, smartphones, and telecommunications in general. So, while Broadcom is growing thanks to AI, it doesn't depend on this market as much as Nvidia does \u2014 this could make Broadcom a safer bet over time.\nStill, it's also key to remember Citadel's Griffin hasn't exited his Nvidia position. He holds a considerable number of shares. So, the billionaire clearly hasn't lost faith in Nvidia and continues to believe the stock could generate solid returns.\nAll of this means there are reasons to be optimistic about both of these AI stocks. That said, one thing right now supports the idea of forgetting Nvidia and following Griffin into Broadcom, and that's valuation. Broadcom trades for 31x forward earnings estimates compared to 41x for Nvidia.\nThis is a very reasonable price considering the company's track record of growth and potential for gains from AI and the VMware acquisition. And that's why, right now you may want to forget Nvidia, and follow billionaire investor Griffin into Broadcom.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market since the beginning of 2023, clocking stunning gains of 799% and outpacing the S&P 500 index's 45% jump by a massive margin. This was due to the impressive growth in the company's revenue and earnings due to the healthy demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\nThis phenomenal surge is why Nvidia is now trading at a rich valuation. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 77 is well above the Nasdaq 100 index's multiple of 32 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). This is why some Wall Street analysts are now concerned about the company's ability to sustain its red-hot rally.\nNew Street Research recently downgraded Nvidia from buy to neutral, citing the stock's valuation. Analyst Pierre Ferragu has a one-year price target of $135 on the stock, which points toward a very limited upside from current levels. Meanwhile, the stock's median one-year price target of $130, as per 62 analysts covering the stock, also indicates that it's unlikely to deliver more gains.\nDoes this mean it's now time for investors to book their profits and sell Nvidia stock?\nNew Street Research believes that Nvidia stock could deliver more gains only if there's a sizable increase in its outlook beyond 2025. It's analysts aren't convinced that this scenario is going to materialize just yet. The combination of Nvidia's rich valuation and concerns about sustaining its terrific growth next year seems to have dented confidence in the company.\nBut a closer look at the potential growth of the AI chip market, which Nvidia dominates, and the company's robust pricing power suggest it could indeed sustain healthy growth in 2025 and beyond. Market research firm TechNavio is forecasting the AI chip market will see\u00a0 an incredible annual growth rate of 68% through 2028, adding $390 billion in incremental revenue.\nWith an estimated 94% share of this market, Nvidia remains in a terrific position to capitalize on this opportunity. Of course, there's competition from the likes of AMD and Intel in the AI chip market, but Nvidia is expected to remain the dominant player. For example, Citigroup expects Nvidia to control between 90% and 95% of the AI chip market in 2024 and 2025.\nOne reason that may be the case is because of the Nvidia's ability to command a technology lead over rivals. Its next-generation Blackwell AI chips are already in full production, as management said on the latest earnings conference call. It also pointed out that the demand for Blackwell is \"well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year.\"\nIt's worth noting that Nvidia's Blackwell chips are manufactured on a 4-nanometer (nm) node. For comparison, AMD's flagship MI300X AI accelerator is reportedly manufactured on a 5nm and 6nm process. The smaller process node allows Nvidia to pack in more transistors, making its chips more powerful and energy efficient.\nMore specifically, the Blackwell chips pack 208 billion transistors, as compared to 153 billion transistors on the MI300X. This explains why the demand for Nvidia's new processors exceeds supply. Moreover, even if Nvidia were to lose ground in the AI chip market in the future, its data center revenue is expected to multiply significantly, thanks to the massive addressable opportunity present in this space.\nAll this explains why Nvidia's revenue estimates have been heading higher consistently of late.\nMoreover, analysts are estimating Nvidia's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 43% for the next five years. Based on its earnings of $1.19 per share in fiscal 2024, the company's bottom line could jump to $7.11 after five years. Multiply that with the Nasdaq 100's forward earnings multiple of 29.5 and Nvidia's stock price could increase to $210, implying a 60% upside from current levels.\nIt may not be a good idea to sell shares of Nvidia right now, and a closer look at the company's valuation indicates it isn't really expensive when considering the growth that the stock is expected to deliver.\nWhile it's true that Nvidia stock is expensive right now when compared to the broader index, it would be wrong to take a look at its valuation in isolation. The company delivered a 262% year-over-year increase in revenue in fiscal Q1 to a record $26 billion, along with a 461% increase in adjusted earnings. For comparison, the S&P 500 index's earnings grew an estimated 7.1% in the first quarter of the calendar year.\nAs it turns out, Nvidia's rapid earnings growth is why its P/E has dropped in the past year, signifying that it's been able to justify the premium valuation.\nThe company's forward P/E ratio of 48 isn't very expensive considering that the U.S. technology sector has a similar earnings multiple. So selling Nvidia stock based on its valuation doesn't look like a good idea. The terrific growth that it's been delivering and its ability to sustain it could result in more upside in the long run.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Text": "The biggest beneficiary of the AI boom is still trying to figure how to sell its chips to China without running afoul of Washington's chip controls.\nNvidia is working on a version of its new flagship AI chip for the China market, Reuters reports citing anonymous sources. The U.S. chip designer is reportedly working with Inspur, one of its major distributors in China, to help launch and sell the made-for-China version of its Blackwell series chip.\nNeither Nvidia nor Inspur immediately responded to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\nThe U.S. has controlled sales of Nvidia's AI chips to China since October 2022. Nvidia has tried to develop new chips that complies with U.S. regulations, only to run afoul of Washington tightening the screws further and Chinese customers wary of a less-powerful product.\nBefore the U.S. imposed chip export controls, China used to contribute a quarter of Nvidia's data center revenue. Data center revenue aligns with the company's chip business. The company admitted in May that data center revenue in China is down significantly since Washington expanded chip controls in October 2023.\nStill, Nvidia is poised to sell over a million of its H20 chips, currently the most advanced chip available to the Chinese market, this year, according to research firm SemiAnalysis. The firm expects H20 sales to generate $12 billion in sales for the U.S. chip designer this year. (The company had $60.9 billion in revenue for its most recent fiscal year, which ended January 2024.)\nNvidia unveiled its Blackwell chip series in March, with mass production set for later this year. The company claims the new platform will allow users to run real-time generative AI applications at significantly lower cost than its predecessors.\nThe U.S. has shown no signs of letting up the pressure on semiconductor-related export control measures.\nWashington is reportedly pressuring the Netherlands and Japan to further restrict Chinese access to chipmaking equipment, including considering invoking a rule that would give it jurisdiction over any product that uses U.S. technology.\nNvidia shares rose around 1.5% in pre-market trading on Monday. The company's shares dropped almost 10% last week following reports of the possibility of expanded controls, as well as former President Donald Trump's comments that the island of Taiwan, a chipmaking hub, should pay for its own defense.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "With shares up by almost 28,000% in just 10 years, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) rally will go down in history. A $2,000 investment made in 2014 would be worth $560,000 today \u2014 more than enough to buy a medium-priced home in cash. But returns like that probably won't continue forever.\nNew investors must decide whether the risks of holding Nvidia stock today justify the potential rewards. Let's discuss two reasons why it might be time to sell the stock, and one reason to consider buying more.\nAfter almost two years of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven growth, Nvidia's future is now intimately linked to the future of this one industry. Most retail investors are not fluent in this highly technical field, so we must rely on experts to crunch the numbers. Some of their perspectives are alarming.\nAccording to MIT Professor Daron Acemoglu, only around a quarter of AI tasks may be cost-effective in the next 10 years. He believes large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Alphabet's Bard will need higher-quality data to improve \u2014 more so than better hardware. And it is unclear where this data will come from, considering that many quality sources have already been tapped.\nAcemoglu's concerns echo remarks from analysts at investment bank Goldman Sachs, who claim tech companies may struggle to monetize the $1 trillion they will pour into AI investment over the coming years.\nAs a picks-and-shovels AI company, Nvidia can make money even when its customers lose. But this situation can't last forever. Eventually, consumer-facing AI algorithms will need to become profitable, or clients will stop buying the expensive Nvidia chips to run and train them. This risky situation could lead to a decline in the company's growth rate and, by extension, it's valuation. So now might be the best time for investors to take profits.\nWith a market cap of roughly $3 trillion, Nvidia is the third-biggest company in the world \u2014 trading for 47 times forward earnings.\nAt first glance, this looks reasonable, if not downright cheap, because of the company's explosive growth rate. Second-quarter revenue doubled to $13.51 billion, while net income surged 843% to $6.2 billion. But the situation is a little more complicated than it appears on the surface.\nNvidia's valuation prices in future growth, which means the market expects the company to continue expanding past its already massive size. The cracks forming on the consumer-facing side of the AI industry will make this harder to pull off. Nvidia will also face challenging comps as it seeks to exceed this year's spectacular performance.\nIt is risky for investors to hold stock in an overvalued company because they are betting on growth that hasn't occurred yet. And it might make more sense to offload shares before market sentiment sours.\nNvidia stock is in a challenging place. The AI industry faces an uncertain future in monetizing LLMs, and the company's valuation looks too high, considering its undiversified revenue base and the challenging comps it will face next year and beyond. With all that said, long term investing is the key to sustainable returns in the stock market because it allows investors to wait out near-term challenges in order for a company's long-term value to shine through.\nFor buyers, Nvidia still represents the best way to bet on the future of AI technology because of its picks and shovels business model and technological lead over rivals bolstered through its software solutions like CUDA, designed to work specifically with Nvidia hardware and make clients less likely to switch to rival chipmakers. Investors who buy the stock now are betting on its ability to navigate near term headwinds as the AI industry matures over the coming decades.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Why Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Growth Stock Pick According to Ray Dalio?",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of Ray Dalio\u2019s Top 10 Growth Stock Picks with 30+% Revenue Growth.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks with 30+% revenue growth.\nValuing a stock comes in several shapes and flavors. The most common of these is the price to earnings ratio. Not only is this ratio used to evaluate the premium that investors are paying for a firm right now, but it is also used in tandem with forecast earnings to wager a guess at the future share price. This allows investors to position their portfolio with respect to the market and invest in those stocks that they believe can rise in the future.\nHowever, a stock's earnings aren't the only income statement item used in stock valuation. Two other popular approaches are the price to sales or P/S ratio and its peer Enterprise Value to Revenue or EV/Revenue ratio. Both of these look at a firm's top line performance, and the latter is typically used to value those firms that are in high growth sectors that are ripe for acquisitions.\nAmong these two ratios, the P/S ratio was popularized by the billionaire Ken Fisher. One of the richest people in the world, Fisher has a net worth of $11.2 billion. He shared his approach to using revenue growth in an article for the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) in 1984. Fisher shared that the P/S ratio could help investors \"ratios measure the popularity of the stock.\" This, according to him, was key since it enabled them to sift out those stocks with low P/S ratios as these carried the highest chances of gaining value in the future in case of positive developments. Fisher added that while the P/E ratio was also a measure of popularity, it was too \"elastic\" and dependent on the various accounting assumptions used to arrive at net income.\nA P/S ratio, on the other hand, removed the effects of these \"accounting assumptions,\" shared Fisher. To back his claims, he outlined that the stocks in the lower quartile (25%) of P/S ratios delivered 64.57% and 56.11% in returns for the bottom seven and nine stocks, respectively which far outstripped the 28.67% in returns of the nine lowest P/E stocks.\nHowever, this piece is about Ray Dalio and not Ken Fisher. Like Fisher, Dalio is also one of the richest people in the world. As of July 2024, Forbes Magazine estimates his net worth to sit at $15.4 billion. Dalio's hedge fund Bridgewater Associates' had listed $19.7 billion worth of investment positions through its SEC filings for 2024's first quarter. These investments follow his approach of taking a broader look at the global economy and geopolitical environment and seeing which stocks can benefit.\nTalking about returns, the past couple of years have been tough for Dalio's firm. While he is neither Bridgewater's CEO nor CIO right now, his philosophy is responsible for having set up most of Bridgewater's most well known products like its Pure Alpha fund. Bridgewater's Pure Alpha has struggled over the past four years. It has lost 4% during this time period, in an environment where global bonds and the economy have struggled due to high inflation and interest rates.\nAt the same time, even though Bridgewater has struggled during recent economic crises, it has managed to hold its ground during several crises of the past. For instance, in 2008, the firm delivered 8.7% in gains at a time when the S&P 500 tumbled by 38.5%. It's times like these that show the true mettle of a hedge fund boss, and during 2018, Bridgewater delivered 14.6% in returns which were in sharp contrast to the hedge fund industry's average 6.7% in losses. As for the Pure Alpha 11 fund, it has delivered 11.4% in returns between 1991 and 2022. Finally, 2024 seems to be a breath of fresh air for Dalio's firm too since during Q1 it posted a strong 16% in returns which were 11 percentage points higher than the hedge fund industry's average 4.59% in returns.\nComing back to revenue growth, while Fisher's central point when favoring P/S over P/E is the undue effect of accounting on earnings and by extension on the share price, is it possible that revenue surprises also drive stock prices? If they do, then the merit of using P/S, and particularly lower P/S stocks as an investment, increases and becomes more important. On this front, research from Emory University and the Stern Business School analyzed income statements, balance sheets, and returns data between 1987 and 2003, to check if there's any relation between revenue surprises and stock returns around earnings announcements.\nIt revealed that \"earnings surprises that are accompanied by revenue surprises signal more persistent earnings growth than similar levels of earnings surprises not accompanied by matching revenues surprises.\" In numerical terms, the research concluded that revenue surprises provide another valuable signal to investors since when stocks were screened for revenue and earnings surprises, the difference between abnormal returns in this category was 8.41% which was nearly two percentage points higher than the difference for stocks screened only for earnings surprises.\nSo, as it appears that revenue is an equally important part of stock valuation, we decided to look at Ray Dalio's top revenue growth stocks.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Ray Dalio's top growth stocks with 30%+ revenue growth, we first filtered the 230 largest positions of Bridgewater Associates by investment value to pick out only those stocks with an absolute revenue growth greater than 80% for the past three years. Then, these stocks were further filtered with their 1-year revenue growth, and those with a growth higher than 30% were selected. These stocks are ranked by the value of the firm's stake in them during Q1 2024.\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 186\n1 Yr Revenue Growth: 126%\nBridgewater Associates\u2019 Q1 2024 Stake: $636 million\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the GPU designer that's at the heart of the AI race. Its biggest competitive moat are its GPUs, which are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s bread and butter and its primary products. These have allowed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to have a three year revenue growth of 267% and propelled it to a $3 trillion+ market capitalization. Its GPUs also enjoy a tight link with NVIDIA's CUDA platform that enables users to tightly control their use. However, while they provide NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a considerable competitive moat, the biggest concern for the firm is its large customers developing in house products. On this front, the latest updates come from OpenAI's Sam Altman and Elon Musk, both of whom are either interested in developing their own AI chips or using already developed custom chips to compete with NVIDIA.\u00a0 Therefore, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has to keep up its competitive edge, and as of now, its next generation Rubin AI platform is slated to launch in 2026.\nPolen Capital mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\"For the second quarter in a row, NVIDIA represented the top detractor to relative performance as the stock climbed another 37%, bringing the year-to-date return to +150%. As of this writing, NVIDIA is the third largest company in the world, but for a brief moment, it surpassed Microsoft to become the largest company in the world. Yet again, the company delivered blowout results that surpassed already lofty expectations, reinforcing the narrative that NVIDIA is the only obvious \"AI winner\" due to the amount of revenue it is currently generating.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the stocks with 30+% revenue growth. You can visit Ray Dalio\u2019s Top 10 Growth Stock Picks with 30+% Revenue Growth\u00a0to see the other growth stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Brian Baker, CFA ",
        "Text": "Nvidia\u2019s stock has performed unbelievably well over almost any time period, creating enormous wealth for its shareholders. The company has grown from a relatively unknown designer of chips used in video games to the main beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom.\nNvidia joined the list of trillion-dollar companies in 2023 and is valued at around $3 trillion as of July 2024. The booming stock has made the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, the 13th richest person in the world, with a net worth of about $111 billion, according to Bloomberg.\nIn May, the company announced record results as well as a 10-for-1 stock split that took effect in June. Its quarterly revenues grew more than 200 percent from the prior year, while its earnings skyrocketed more than 600 percent.\n\u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun \u2014 companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center \u2014 AI factories \u2014 to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence,\u201d Huang said in a statement.\n\u201cAI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient, while expanding revenue opportunities,\u201d he said.\nEvery investor wishes they could go back in time and invest in the best stock market performers of today, but what did Nvidia\u2019s business look like 10 years ago compared to today?\nIn its 2014 fiscal year, Nvidia generated about $4.1 billion in revenue and about $440 million in net income. A solid business, but hardly the stuff of trillion-dollar valuations.\nFast forward to its 2024 fiscal year when Nvidia generated $60.9 billion in revenue and net income of nearly $30 billion. With that kind of growth and profitability, it\u2019s easy to see why Nvidia has been one of the best long-term investments.\nHere\u2019s how much a $1,000 investment in Nvidia is worth today if you\u2019d made it one year ago, five years ago or 10 years ago. The calculation is based on the July 16 closing price of $126.36.\n1-year: A $1,000 investment in Nvidia one year ago has grown about 178 percent and would be worth $2,779.50 today.\n5-years: A $1,000 investment in Nvidia five years ago has compounded at 97.8 percent annually and would be worth $30,270.64 today.\n10-years: A $1,000 investment in Nvidia 10 years ago has compounded at 74.5 percent annually and would be worth $261,490.87 today.\nWhile it\u2019s easy to look back and see how much money you\u2019d have made if you\u2019d invested in the biggest stock market winners, investing is always about what will happen in the future. Whether or not Nvidia will continue to reward investors in the same way over the next decade is difficult to predict, but fortunately investors can earn decent returns by holding a basket of diversified stocks.\nBroadly diversified index funds, such as those that track the S&P 500, allow investors to participate in the stock market at a low cost, without having to identify individual companies to buy and sell. While this more diversified portfolio limits your returns, compared to holding a single stock, it also provides some protection when a few stocks perform poorly.\nBe sure to research any stocks thoroughly before investing. You\u2019ll want to understand the company\u2019s business and strategy, its competitors, financial position and management team before making an investment decision. Owning individual stocks can be extremely rewarding over time, but few will match the returns seen by Nvidia shareholders.\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision. In addition, investors are advised that past investment product performance is no guarantee of future price appreciation.\n"

        "Author": "  Omkar Godbole ",
        "Text": "NVDA's 30-day implied volatility has surpassed bitcoin and ether's gauge.\nBitcoin has exhibited a strong positive correlation with NVDA since late 2022.\nNasdaq-listed Nvidia (NVDA), hailed by Goldman Sachs as the world's most important stock this year, is expected to see more significant price swings than crypto market leaders bitcoin and ether.\nNVDA's 30-day options implied volatility, a gauge of anticipated price swings over four weeks, has recently surged from an annualized 48% to 71%, according to data source Fintel.\nMeanwhile, crypto exchange Deribit's bitcoin DVOL index, a measure of 30-day implied volatility, has declined from 68% to 49%, according to charting platform TradingView. The ETH DVOL index has dropped from 70% to 55%.\nOptions are derivative contracts that protect the buyer from bullish and bearish price swings. The implied volatility, influenced by demand for options, represents the degree of uncertainty or expected price turbulence.\nNVDA, a bellwether for all things artificial intelligence (AI) and the producer of graphics processing units formerly used for cryptocurrency mining, has emerged as a barometer of sentiment for both equity and crypto markets since the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022.\nBoth bitcoin and NVDA bottomed out in late 2022 and have since exhibited a strong positive correlation. As of writing, the correlation between 90-day prices on bitcoin and NVDA was 0.73.\nNVDA's stock is down roughly 26% since reaching a high of $140 last month, offering bearish cues to the crypto market. Bitcoin has been locked in the range of $60,000 to $70,000, CoinDesk data show.\nThe spike in NVDA's implied volatility is likely related to the hedging activity of market makers, a phenomenon often seen in the crypto market, according to the crypto financial platform BloFin.\n\"It must be admitted that negative gamma does not only dominate the crypto market. In the U.S. stock market, SPY and QQQ have experienced significant declines caused by negative gamma hedging, and the high volatility risk has made NVDA's front-month implied volatility level significantly surpass that of cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH,\" Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin, told CoinDesk.\nNegative or short gamma means market makers trade in the direction of the price moves to maintain their overall exposure direction-neutral, inadvertently adding to market volatility.\n"

        "Title": "'Nvidia is slowly becoming the IBM of the AI era' says Jim Keller, perhaps forgetting how short-lived IBM's PC monopoly was",
        "Author": "  Jacob Fox ",
        "Text": "Few things are more certain than Jim Keller, ex-AMD and ex-Tesla engineer and current CEO of AI computer company Tenstorrent, making bold claims in public appearances. There is at least one thing more more certain than this, however, this being that Nvidia is firmly cemented as the king AI hardware. Combine the two certitudes and you have Keller, in a recent DemystifySci podcast, stating that \"Nvidia is slowly becoming the IBM of the AI era.\"\nAccording to Keller, for AI, Nvidia currently has \"the best processors by functionality and obvious proof points,\" which has meant that \"all the big tech companies are in an arms race and they're all calling Nvidia to get allocation\" for their new AI processors. This, at least, is certainly true.\n2024's exploding AI market almost feels like the stirrings of a brave new world for tech. We don't need futurist Kurzweils persistent and wacky techno-optimism to see that. We also don't need Keller's industry experience to see Nvidia's gigantism. We know it just from the numbers. For instance, Nvidia raked in over $26 billion in Q1 2024, with over $22 billion of this coming from AI datacentre demand. And Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang figures that AI constitutes the \"next industrial revolution\" that has Nvidia at the centre.\nNvidia's foresight to pivot to AI early on, combined with infrastructures already in place, put them in the prime spot for AI market dominance. No other chip foundry can match demand like Nvidia can. And with big shots like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta all wanting a slice of the burgeoning but not-quite-there-yet AI pie, there's good reason to suppose that Keller's right and Nvidia could become to AI what IBM was to computers\u2026 a few decades ago.\nAfter achieving dominance in the mainframe market for businesses, in the 1980s IBM went on to spawn the personal computer, for a while being the only real game in town for PCs. If you said \"PC,\" you were talking about IBM. That's what Keller seems to have in mind when he talks about Nvidia and AI.\nPutting aside the obvious concerns over monopoly, to follow through on Keller's analogy we shouldn't forget what happened with IBM back in the 1990s and early 2000s. Its PC dominance was short-lived, in part thanks to its own decisions. Microsoft made the operating system for IBM PCs, IBM allowed them to sell the MS-DOS OS to other companies, and that was that: Companies started to associate \"PC\" with Microsoft. IBM started divesting its production in the 1990s, and in 2005 it sold its PC division to Lenovo.\nNow, I'm not saying the same fate is in store for Nvidia, but it is important to remember that monopolistic markets rarely remain thus, and Keller's own analogy should remind us of it.\nThis is even more important to remember in such an incredibly new market as the AI one. We don't know how any of it will turn out, but there are already intimations that the AI datacentre market is built on slippery foundations.\nAI, explained\nWhat is artificial general intelligence?: We dive into the lingo of AI and what the terms actually mean.\nSequoia analyst David Cahn (via Tom's Hardware) reckons that, to pay for the AI infrastructure they've erected, AI companies need to earn about $600 billion per year, which even optimistic projections say is impossible. This could hint (or perhaps scream) the growth of a financial bubble that nobody wants to see pop.\nBut\u2014and not to sound like a broken record, here\u2014the AI market is new. As in, completely fresh-out-of-the-oven-and-scalding-hot new. And if it does mark the next industrial revolution, we can't rule out changes and innovations that give AI companies all the revenue they need.\nIn which case, if Nvidia had the foresight to get in on the booming AI chip fabrication market before anyone else, maybe it also has the foresight to grow a scary bubble that unforeseen revenue-generating innovation will fill.\nOr, perhaps Keller's IBM comments will be even more prescient than he maybe realised. I suppose we'll see.\n"

        "Title": "Blackwell Demand to Benefit Both Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. Is It Time to Buy Both Stocks?",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "According to recent reports out of Taiwan, the demand for graphic processing units (GPUs) based on Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) next-generation Blackwell architecture is so robust that the chipmaker has increased its Blackwell orders at its primary semiconductor contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u00a0(NYSE: TSM), or TSMC for short, by 25%.\nLet's take a closer look at the demand for Blackwell chips and the impact it could have on both Nvidia and TSMC.\nA report from Taiwan's Economic Daily News indicates that TSMC is soon about to start Blackwell GPU production using its 4-nanometer technology and that due to customer demand, Nvidia increased its order by 25%. The publication also states that demand for Nvidia terminal server cabinets also surged, with shipments now expected to rise to 60,000 units, up from a prior estimate of 40,000. Most of the terminal shipments are expected to be Nvidia's GB200 NVL36 model, which includes 36 GB200 Superchips, 18 Grace CPUs, and 36 enhanced B200 GPUs, at a cost of around $1.8 million.\nThe news follows analyst reports from earlier this month that channel check data -- independent stock analysis that examines a company's distribution channels --\u00a0was indicating very robust demand for Blackwell-based chips and rack-scale systems. Analysts from UBS, Keybanc, and Wolfe Research all cited stronger-than-expected Blackwell demand as reasons for raising their Nvidia price targets.\nUBS took its target from $120 to $150, believing the chipmaker could generate $5 in earnings per share next year. Keybanc, meanwhile, raised its target price from $130 to $180, believing the company could generate $200 billion in data center revenue in 2025. Wolfe upped its target from $125 to $150 saying its sees 50% or more GPU growth for the company.\nWhile channel check data\u00a0is not perfect, where there is smoke there tends to be fire, and with so many sources citing strong Blackwell demand and cloud computing companies racing to build out artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, it seems pretty safe to say that demand for Blackwell GPUs and rack-scale systems does indeed look insatiable.\nGiven this, both Nvidia and TSMC look poised to show very strong growth next year.\nShares of both Nvidia and TSMC have had strong runs. TSMC stock is up over 300% the past five years, while Nvidia stock is up over 2,500%, which is just incredible. However, both stocks are still reasonably valued. Nvidia currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 43 times, while TSMC trades at about 27 times. Given their strong growth prospects, these multiples are not expensive.\nIn fact, investments in these stocks are both bets that the demand for GPUs to help build out AI infrastructure will continue to grow strongly. With Nvidia looking to push its architecture innovation to about once a year, demand and pricing should remain strong well into the future.\nNvidia is already working on its successor to Blackwell, called Rubin, which it plans to launch late next year. The company has a wide moat due to its CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software platform, so together with its continual innovation push, I don't see any company threatening its leadership position anytime soon.\nTSMC, meanwhile, should continue to benefit from Nvidia's success and the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout, as well as competitors chasing Nvidia and looking to develop their own GPUs. The company also looks poised to take some price hikes, while it continues to improve its production technology. It is looking to move down to 2-nanometer production technology, which will allow for increased speed and lower power consumption of the chips. Smaller chips also allow more to be put onto a wafer, saving costs and increasing capacity.\nTSMC's largest customer, Apple, has reportedly already been planning to lock up all its 2-nanometer production capacity, which shows that the company is not just riding Nvidia's coattails. With companies battling it out to get capacity and use TSMC's latest technology, the company finds itself in a strong position moving forward.\nAll in all, the Blackwell demand news helps counter the argument that AI chip demand could evaporate after the initial rush of orders. With this risk seemingly off the table for now, this looks like a great opportunity to buy both stocks.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA), the leading AI chipmaker in the world, has seen its market value surge 2,742% in the last five years. On the back of these stellar gains, Wall Street analysts are divided on the prospects for Nvidia stock today. While some analysts argue that Nvidia\u2019s valuation is expensive, others make the case that the company still has a long runway to grow, which justifies its premium valuation. I am neutral on the outlook for Nvidia stock, as I believe the current valuation reflects the economic reality facing the company.\nNvidia still has the backing of analysts who believe in its innovation and market competitiveness. For example, Morgan Stanley (MS) recently upgraded its rating on Nvidia and set a price target of $144, citing their confidence in the company\u2019s ability to stay at the top of the AI chip industry.\nBlackwell chips, which are faster and more versatile compared to existing AI chips, are expected to attract strong demand from big tech companies, such as Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), as these companies accelerate their AI investments.\nEach Blackwell chip is expected to be priced between $35,000 and $50,000, contributing positively to Nvidia\u2019s profit margins, given that H100 and H200 chips \u2013 Nvidia\u2019s best-selling products today \u2013 are priced between $25,000 to $40,000.\nEdward Jones analysts also pointed out recently that Nvidia\u2019s massive share in the AI chip market and its comfortable lead in the GPU market highlight the company\u2019s competitive advantages.\nNvidia has successfully transitioned from a gaming-oriented chip developer to one focused on data centers. This new focus has allowed the company to expand its horizons and cater to the growing demand for data center GPUs. The CUDA platform \u2013 an AI development standard across various domains that allows developers to optimize processor performance while easily creating robust AI applications \u2013 has also been a growth driver in recent times and is expected to contribute positively to Nvidia\u2019s growth in the future.\nAccording to many Wall Street analysts, Nvidia\u2019s ability to continue to attract and retain engineering talent is also a key differentiator, as it positions the company to be at the forefront of innovation.\nThough analysts are generally positive about Nvidia stock, some are questioning the sustainability of earnings growth as well as current valuation levels. For instance, New Street Research recently downgraded Nvidia due to its extended valuation. New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu believes there will be limited upside from here unless Nvidia boosts the outlook beyond 2025 meaningfully, which is not likely to happen anytime soon.\nNvidia is currently valued at a forward P/E of 47x, which does not scream overvaluation, but this may change if growth decelerates in the foreseeable future.\nDA Davidson analyst Gil Luria is bearish on Nvidia, as he believes the demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs will decline in the next 18 months as tech giants such as Amazon and Meta Platforms (META) are likely to develop their own chips. Barclays (BCS) analyst Blayne Curtis also noted recently that Nvidia\u2019s long-term outlook is not as rosy as it seems, given that some of its biggest customers are already looking for a solution to reduce their dependency on Nvidia chips.\nNvidia is enjoying competitive advantages, evident from its industry-leading gross margin and leading market share. According to Mizuho Securities, Nvidia controls between 70% and 95% of the market for AI chips, which gives the company pricing power. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia\u2019s gross margins came to 78% compared to just 41% for Intel (INTC) and 51% for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\nThese competitive advantages will help Nvidia report strong earnings growth in the next few quarters, but some risks are looming on the horizon. Last November, at the DealBook Summit, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang admitted that he wakes up every morning in fear that the company will fail due to increasing competition.\nAMD, with its Radeon Instinct GPUs, is trying to capture a share of the growing data center market, and the company\u2019s acquisition of Xilinx in 2022 has helped it gain traction in the AI and machine learning field. Intel is also making inroads into the data center market with its Habana Gaudi AI processors, which are designed to compete with Nvidia\u2019s data center GPUs.\nThe biggest threat to Nvidia\u2019s AI dominance comes from big tech giants who are focused on reducing their reliance on Nvidia\u2019s products.\nGoogle, wanting to be self-sufficient when it comes to sourcing advanced AI chips, has developed an in-house AI chip series called Tensor Processing Units. These chips are already used in Google\u2019s data centers. Amazon has also developed its own AI chips called Inferentia and Trainium, targeting AWS customers who use Nvidia GPUs for AI applications. In addition to these tech giants, Microsoft and Meta have also announced investments in their own AI chips.\nBased on the ratings of 41 Wall Street analysts, NVDA stock comes in as a Strong Buy, with 37 Buy ratings and four Holds. The average Nvidia stock price target is $140.85, which implies upside potential of 11.5% from the current market price.\nNvidia is enjoying competitive advantages, which justifies the premium valuation it trades at. However, competition in the AI chip market is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years, with rival chipmakers and big tech companies aggressively investing in AI chips to grab a share of this booming market. Because of this looming threat, Nvidia seems fairly valued today, with no margin of safety to attract new investors at the current stock price.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia started as a humble graphics card maker. Now it\u2019s riding the tech industry\u2019s AI obsession to absurd new heights. The company added $329 billion to its market cap on Wall Street today after a record-breaking day of stock trading, Bloomberg reports.\nMost people know Nvidia as the manufacturer of the chip that powers their Android phones, Nintendo Switches, and top-end PC gaming rigs. It got its first big break designing the GPU for Microsoft\u2019s original Xbox, and helped Sony design the graphics processor for the PlayStation 3. For years it was the company that held up big hunks metal with plastic fans on stage to woo gamers with upgrades they couldn\u2019t afford. Now it\u2019s quickly become something else entirely.\nNvidia was trading below $15 a share at the start of 2023. Less than two years later it\u2019s over $100. What changed? Microsoft and others are gobbling up GPUs to power their AI ambitions. It seemed like the fever might have broken amid a renewed wave of skepticism around what generative AI and machine learning will actually be useful for, but then Microsoft announced it\u2019s going to continue pouring billions into server farms for AI computing and Nvidia\u2019s stock shot up more than most companies are worth in less than eight hours. Let\u2019s remember some previous high scores:\n$329 billion is more than Netflix, Coca-Cola, and Bank of America. It\u2019s the value of eight Electronic Arts and 12 Take-Twos, whose subsidiary Rockstar Games publishes Grand Theft Auto VI next year. Nvidia isn\u2019t worth more than ever\u2014it peaked last month at over $3 trillion\u2014but this single-day swing points to how completely untethered the company has become from its recent history or the current marketplace reality in which OpenAI is reportedly losing billions. With Meta pivoting from VR to the AI chip arms race and others chasing desperately to catch up, Nvidia has quickly become the center of the tech and financial universe.\n\u2018These violent delights have violent ends.\u201d We might just be witnessing the first of many transformations before Nvidia\u2019s final form. Maybe it will be the first true megacorp in a future cyberpunk dystopia, or maybe some of the plates stop spinning and start breaking and the company goes back to releasing hard-to-find Gundam-branded graphics cards for $4,000 gaming rigs that let you play Ghost of Tsushima in 4K at 120fps. It\u2019s never a good sign when the numbers get so insane that they stop meaning anything.\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n"

The climb has added almost $1.9 trillion to Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization, and briefly resulted in it attaining the title of the world\u2019s largest company.\nAnalyst downgrades are rare for a company that has become the biggest beneficiary of the artificial intelligence spending boom. Nearly 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock. However, valuation is often cited as a concern. Nvidia trades at more than 22 times estimated revenue for the next 12 months, making it the most expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index by this measure.\nNew Street set a one-year price target of $135 for Nvidia, compared with its Friday close of $125.82.\nBeyond Nvidia, New Street is positive on both Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

        "Text": "The Nvidia (NVDA) money-making train has only just pulled out of the station.\nOr so says one veteran tech investor.\n\"I'm saying like it [Nvidia's value] could double again between now and the end of the year,\" EMJ Capital founder and president Eric Jackson said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above or listen here).\nTo put that in perspective, Jackson thinks Nvidia's market cap could hit $6 trillion by year-end from $3.25 trillion or so currently.\nJackson reasoned the company stands to get there by delivering a very, very strong earnings report in August or November (or both) that shows off continuing demand for H100 and H200 chips while teeing up the potential of its new AI-focused Blackwell chips.\nThat would align with what Nvidia founder Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance on demand trends back in late May.\nIf Nvidia's earnings reports come in as he expects, Jackson thinks investors will be open to paying a much higher price-to-earnings (PE) multiple to own its stock.\nThat's a bold statement, seeing as Nvidia already trades on a forward PE of about 50 times, per Yahoo Finance data, almost two times the broader market multiple.\nAdded Jackson, \"I don't know if it's going to be August [earnings], I don't know if it's going to be November [earnings], but I think there is going be this euphoric reaction. And if so, the stock goes back to 65x forward earnings and you're there at like $250 per share.\"\nNvidia shares trade at $131 as of this writing, up more than 170% year to date.\nTo be sure, it has been another year of milestones for Nvidia.\nOn June 18, its market cap hit a staggering $3.34 trillion, eclipsing Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world's most valuable company. Before that, Huang took the wraps off his powerful Blackwell chips and proclaimed the company is building AI factories.\nNvidia has since lost the most-valuable-company crown to Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (second place), but detractors on the Street are few and far between.\n\"Positive takeaways for Nvidia include: 1) despite the impending launch of Blackwell in the second half of 2024, we are not seeing any signs of a demand pause as demand for H100 remains robust, as we continue to see rush orders; and 2) the interest and demand in GB200 is greater than we initially had sized as the majority of the mix is expected to be NVL72 vs. NVL36,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh said in a client note this week.\nA few non-Nvidia permabulls have started to appear, however.\nNew Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu downgraded his rating on Nvidia last week to Neutral, citing valuation concerns.\nFerragu said he sees \"limited further upside\" based on conversations with contacts in the supply chain. The bull case on Nvidia may not emerge beyond 2025, putting expectations at risk, Ferragu explained.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia's success story is attracting hungry competitors \u2014 and that may stand in the way of the chip juggernaut, warned Goldman Sachs asset manager Brook Dane.\n\"There's very little likelihood that there isn't competition out there [for Nvidia],\" he said.\nFind more episodes of Opening Bid on our video hub.

The new processors combine two squares of silicon the size of the company's previous offering. Within the series, the B200 is 30 times speedier than its predecessor at some tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.\nNvidia will work with Inspur, one of its major distributor partners in China, on the launch and distribution of the chip which is tentatively named the \"B20\", two of the sources said. Shipments of the \"B20\" are planned to start in the second quarter of 2025, a separate source told Reuters.\nThe sources declined to be identified as Nvidia has yet to make a public announcement.\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment. Inspur did not respond to requests for comment.\nShares of Nvidia rose 4% in U.S. trading after publication of the Reuters story.\nWashington tightened its controls on exports of cutting-edge semiconductors to China in 2023, seeking to prevent breakthroughs in supercomputing that would aid China's military.\nSince then, Nvidia has developed three chips tailored specifically for the Chinese market.\nThe advent of tighter export U.S. controls has helped Chinese technology giant Huawei and startups like Tencent-backed Enflame make some inroads into the domestic market for advanced AI processors.\nA version of a chip from Nvidia's Blackwell series for the Chinese market would boost the U.S. firm's efforts to fend off those challenges.\nChina accounted for around 17% of Nvidia's revenue in the year to end-January in the wake of U.S. sanctions, sliding from 26% two years earlier.\nNvidia's most advanced chip for the China market, the H20, initially got off to a weak start when deliveries began this year and the U.S. firm priced it below a rival chip from Huawei, Reuters reported in May.\nBut sales are now growing rapidly, two of the sources said.\nNvidia is on track to sell over 1 million of its H20 chips in China this year, worth upwards of $12 billion, according to an estimate from research group SemiAnalysis.\nExpectations are high that the U.S. will continue to keep up the pressure on semiconductor-related export controls.\nThe U.S. wants the Netherlands and Japan to further restrict chipmaking equipment to China, sources have said.\nThe Biden administration also has preliminary plans to place guardrails around the most advanced AI Models, the core software of artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT, sources have said.\nChip stocks globally tumbled last week after Bloomberg News reported that Biden's administration was weighing a measure called the foreign direct product rule that would allow the U.S. to stop a product from being sold if it was made using American technology.\n(Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Edwina Gibbs, Kirsten Donovan)\n"

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.3% after crossing 5,600 for the first time in the prior session.\nTech heavyweights Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) all fell more than 1%.\nInterest rate-sensitive stocks rose after the Consumer Price Index report showed inflation fell last month for the first time since May 2020, raising the probability of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve later this year.\nThe Real Estate Sector Select ETF (XLRE) rose more than 2%, while Utilities (XLU) rose more than 1.5%.\nInflation has remained stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target on an annual basis. But recent economic data has helped fuel a narrative that the central bank should cut rates sooner than later.\nImmediately following Thursday's encouraging inflation data, which showed headline inflation falling month over month for the first time since May 2020, markets were pricing in a roughly 89% chance the Federal Reserve begins to cut rates at its September meeting, up from 75% a day prior, according to data from the CME Group.\nThe data is the latest to build the case for Fed rate cuts.\nOn Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the labor market added 206,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last month, ahead of the 190,000-plus expected by economists. However, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4.1%, up from 4% in the month prior. It was the highest reading in almost three years.\nNotably, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the so-called core PCE price index, showed inflation eased in May. The year-over-year change in core PCE came in at 2.6% over the prior year in May, in line with estimates and the slowest annual gain in more than three years.\n\"The decline in the consumer price index between May and June won\u2019t stick but it strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates in September, particularly as the labor market has softened,\" wrote Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet.\nStill, the economist warned, \"We caution about reading too much into the decline in the CPI in June and don\u2019t believe that this is the new trend.\"\nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, agreed the latest numbers \"put us firmly on the path for a September Fed rate cut\" but said that \"a July policy cut is still off the table.\"\n\"Not only would it spark questions of 'what do they know about the economy that we don't know?' but the Fed still needs to gather additional evidence of waning price pressures to be absolutely certain of the inflation path.\"\nRead more on the latest CPI print here. \nStocks held steady at the open on Thursday after the slowest annual rise in consumer inflation since early 2021.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose to just above the flatline, having crossed 5,600 for the first time on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell slightly, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.1%.\nFalling gas prices helped the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in June decline 0.1% compared with the level in May, when the rate was unchanged.\nCooling inflation bolsters market expectations that the Federal Reserve will meet its 2% inflation target and start cutting rates this year.\nTwo years ago, the June CPI report brought investors the news that inflation was rising at the fastest pace in 40 years.\nToday, investors learned inflation fell last month for the first time since May 2020 as the prospect of (multiple) rate cuts from the Federal Reserve later this year grows more likely by the day.\nThe headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) in June fell 0.1% from the prior month after prices were unchanged in May. On a \"core\" basis, which excludes food and energy, CPI rose 0.1%. Economists had expected prices to rise 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively, last month.\nOn an annual basis, prices rose 3% in June and 3.3% on a core basis.\nThe jump in core CPI over the prior year was the smallest since April 2021.\nOK, OK, I get it \u2014 we are only two earnings reports into earnings season with results from PepsiCo (PEP) and Delta (DAL) out this morning.\nBut, I am instantly concerned about the state of the consumer and how that may impact the vibe around earnings reports in coming weeks (which will arrive against the backdrop of a record-setting market).\nHere's what Delta CEO Ed Bastian told Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith about the consumer:\nAnd here's what PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said on the consumer on his earnings release:\nEight straight quarters of global volume declines for PepsiCo (PEP) isn't going to sit well in the stomachs of investors this morning.\nSeeing the stock sell off by 2% in the premarket, which looks deserved after a first pass of the results.\nI am catching up with PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta around 9:30 a.m. ET today by phone.

        "Text": "Semiconductor stocks have been in fine form on the stock market since the beginning of 2023, thanks to the terrific demand for chips used to power artificial intelligence (AI) servers, smartphones, and personal computers, among other things. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector index has shot up a terrific 115% since the beginning of last year, driven by the outstanding gains that the likes of Nvidia have clocked during this period.\nMore specifically, Nvidia stock has multiplied 8x since the start of 2023, and its market cap now stands at $3.0 trillion. However, the stunning rally in Nvidia stock has made it expensive with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 73, significantly more expensive than the Nasdaq 100's average P/E ratio of 32.\nBut Nvidia may be able to justify its valuation in the long run thanks to the huge opportunity in the AI chip market, where it is the dominant player. However, there is another semiconductor stock that is much cheaper and also enjoying healthy growth in this industry: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). Popularly known as TSMC, the foundry giant could soon join Nvidia in the trillion-dollar market cap club.\nLet's look at the reasons why TSMC is on the path to becoming a trillion-dollar company.\nTSMC released its second-quarter results on July 18. The foundry giant's revenue increased 33% year over year to $20.8 billion, exceeding management's guidance. It reported adjusted earnings of $1.48 per share for the quarter, up 30% year over year. It is worth noting that TSMC's operating margin of 42.5% was also above the forecast range of 40% to 42%.\nMore importantly, TSMC's outlook also exceeded expectations. The company is expecting third-quarter revenue to land between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. The midpoint of this range represents 45% year-over-year growth, a marked acceleration from last quarter. TSMC credits \"strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our leading-edge process technologies\" as the reason behind its bullish outlook.\nA closer look at TSMC's revenue breakdown indicates advanced chip nodes produced 67% of its wafer revenue, up from 53% in the same quarter last year. Advanced chip nodes are defined as process technologies that are 7 nanometers or lower in size. TSMC currently has three such advanced chip nodes in the form of 7nm, 5nm, and 3nm processes.\nThe 5nm node was the biggest seller last quarter with its revenue share climbing five percentage points to 35%. It is worth noting that the smaller the process node, the more powerful the chip. TSMC introduced a 3nm node in the past year, and it already accounted for 15% of second-quarter revenue, further illustrating how the demand for TSMC's advanced chip technologies is increasing.\nMoreover, chipmakers are using advanced process nodes to design AI chips. Nvidia's popular H100, for instance, is based on a 5nm process node. Even Intel and AMD are deploying 5nm chips to manufacture their AI accelerators, while these chipmakers are also looking to move to the more advanced 3nm process node in the near future.\nThe market for AI chips is forecast to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 26% over the next decade, generating $287 billion in revenue at the end of the forecast period, according to a report from Future Market Insights. As the leading foundry services provider in the world with a market share of 62% in Q1, TSMC seems to have a bright future ahead of it.\nTSMC has a market cap of $885 billion as of this writing, which means it needs just 13% share price growth to hit the $1 trillion milestone. The stock has a 12-month median price target of $200 per the 41 analysts covering the stock, implying an 18% jump from current levels. Following its latest quarterly report, TSMC could reach $1 trillion sooner rather than later.\nWhat's more, TSMC's earnings are expected to grow at an annual rate of 21% for the next five years, but it trades at just 30 times trailing earnings, a discount to Nasdaq 100 index. Its price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio), which factors in a company's growth prospects, is less than 1, a common indicator of an undervalued stock.\nIn TSMC, investors get a rare combination of value and growth, and they should take a closer look at this top AI stock before it adds to the 65% gain it has already clocked in 2024.\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist After Its Post-Stock-Split Pullback?",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Most investors would be happy with a stock that doubled in five years. They'd likely be ecstatic about a stock that tripled during the same period. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has skyrocketed more than 30x over the last five years. I'm unsure what emotion adequately describes how investors feel about this phenomenal return.\nSome expected Nvidia's remarkable momentum to accelerate after the company's 10-for-1 stock split conducted following the market close on June 7. And it did -- for a few days. However, shares have since fallen and are now down close to 8% from their high. So should you buy Nvidia after its post-stock-split pullback?\nNo one ever knows for sure when a stock declines if it's the beginning of a major extended downturn or only a short, temporary dip. That's true with Nvidia in this case.\nHowever, it's important to note that there hasn't been any bad news for Nvidia to cause its share price to fall. A few analysts have raised their price targets for the stock. For example, Truist now looks for Nvidia's share price to hit $140 over the next 12 months, up from its previous target of $128.80. Cantor Fitzgerald is even more bullish, raising its price target for Nvidia to $175 from $140.\nSo why has Nvidia's share price retreated somewhat? Part of the decline could be due to some investors taking profits. But some are also concerned about Nvidia's valuation.\nThe stock trades at over 47 times forward earnings. This multiple implies expectations of huge growth. Any hiccup with the company would likely cause Nvidia's stock to fall significantly more than it already has.\nThat said, I think that Nvidia's recent decline is only a temporary dip. For one thing, there's no reason to be more concerned about the company's valuation now than there was before its stock split.\nMore importantly, Nvidia will soon launch its new Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU) platform. CEO Jensen Huang said at Nvidia's shareholder meeting on June 26, \"The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history.\" I suspect he'll be proven right.\nBlackwell can run large language models (LLMs) at up to 25 times less cost and energy consumption than Nvidia's Hopper GPUs. This is critical because energy costs for running these AI models can be significant.\nHuang also said that Blackwell could be the most successful product in the history of computing. I'm not so sure about this prediction. However, I'm confident that Blackwell will keep Nvidia at the top of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. I also expect Nvidia will deliver impressive quarterly results in late 2024 and throughout 2025.\nWith the post-split pullback likely to be only temporary, should you buy Nvidia stock hand over fist? Not necessarily.\nYour investing style is a big factor in deciding whether to buy Nvidia's shares. Income investors will almost certainly want to look elsewhere. Although Nvidia pays a dividend, its forward yield is a minuscule 0.032%. I think risk-averse investors can find better alternatives, too.\nHowever, aggressive growth investors should still like Nvidia. There are no signs the AI boom is waning. Nvidia continues to dominate the AI chip market. I don't view Nvidia as the hand-over-fist buy that it has been in the past, but the stock could still have plenty of room to run.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Samsung Begins Closing Gap in Making AI Memory Chips for Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Yoolim Lee and Ian King ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co., after a series of setbacks in developing the type of memory chips crucial for the artificial intelligence market, is beginning to make progress in narrowing the gap with rival SK Hynix Inc.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUS Reporter to Be Freed by Russia in Major Prisoner Swap\nKamala Harris Wipes Out Trump\u2019s Swing-State Lead in Election Dead Heat\nAckman\u2019s IPO Dream Implodes From $25 Billion to Zero in Weeks\nIran\u2019s Leader Orders Retaliatory Strike on Israel, NYT Says\nIntel to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs, Fund Rebound\nSamsung has made important headway in its comeback, including winning the long-awaited approval from AI giant Nvidia Corp. for a version of its high-bandwidth memory chips called HBM3, according to people familiar with the matter. It also anticipates approval for the next generation, HBM3E, in two to four months, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal developments.\nThe advances come after months of stumbles, including development missteps that allowed the smaller SK Hynix to jump out to a huge lead in the fast-growing sector. It\u2019s unusual \u2014 and humbling \u2014 for South Korea\u2019s largest company to be playing this kind of catchup. Historically, Samsung has led the way in the memory chip market, capitalizing on its scale and engineering expertise. As the company struggled in the HBM field, it took the highly unusual step of replacing the head of its semiconductor division in May.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen Samsung in this position,\u201d said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. \u201cThe industry and Nvidia more than anyone need Samsung, but they need Samsung to be firing on all cylinders.\u201d\nThe company declined to comment on any specific partners but said, in general, it\u2019s collaborating closely with customers and testing is proceeding smoothly.\nSamsung\u2019s latest accomplishments are likely to position the company to capitalize on the booming demand for AI products. The HBM market is projected to rise from $4 billion last year to $71 billion in 2027, according to Morgan Stanley. The faster Samsung gets the blessing of Nvidia, the leader in making AI accelerators, the more revenue it can reap from that increase.\n\u201cInvestors\u2019 perception on Samsung could change soon,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts Shawn Kim and Duan Liu wrote in a research report this month. \u201cThings are improving quickly.\u201d\nThe pair anointed Samsung their top stock pick in the report because they figure the company could grab incremental HBM market share of at least 10% in 2025, adding about $4 billion in revenue. While it would still trail SK Hynix in the field, that progress could shift investor perceptions and lift shares.\nSamsung is likely to face questions about its HBM strategy when it reports final second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. It\u2019s not clear how much detail the company will provide.\nWhile Samsung appears on track to secure Nvidia\u2019s seal of approval by November, the company is still struggling to resolve certain issues, with unpredictable outcomes given the complexity of AI chips. There\u2019s a chance its timeline will slip into 2025, the people said.\nSamsung\u2019s missteps came during an unusual period for the company. Executive Chairman Jay Y. Lee spent years battling prosecutors over bribery and corruption allegations, and, in the meantime, senior leaders didn\u2019t see HBM as a priority. Indeed, the market was a rounding error until OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in late 2022 and set off a frenzy of demand for the Nvidia chips used to train AI models.\nWhile SK Hynix was ready for the surge, Samsung struggled with the complex engineering problems of the new chips. HBM is made up of a collection of DRAM chips stacked on top of each other, eight high in the most recent generation. Each layer generates substantial heat, and then they are packed with Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing unit, or GPUs, which can reach 100 degrees C on their own. The entire stack risks melting down without the proper dissipation and cooling materials.\n\u201cAs you increase those layers, the challenge of developing a reasonable yield becomes more difficult,\u201d said Jake Silverman, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cThe issue is thermal: it runs hot because it\u2019s stacked DRAM. It\u2019s really close to the GPU, which runs even hotter.\u201d\nSamsung had trouble solving this so-called thermal coupling, according to one of the people, who asked not to be named discussing confidential work. In May, the company took dramatic action: It announced Kyung Kye-hyun, the head of the semiconductor division, would step aside and Jun Young-hyun would take his place.\nJun, who joined Samsung in 2000 and helped develop its DRAM and flash memory chips, quickly stepped up the pressure to find solutions. The 63-year-old convened a series of meetings to probe technical details and find the root cause of the problem. In one meeting that lasted hours without break, he lamented that HBM could be part of a broader problem, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nSamsung risked falling behind not just on memory chip technicalities, but also in terms of urgency in innovation. To boost collaboration, he reorganized the team dedicated to HBM and appointed a new head.\nSamsung uses a heat management strategy called thermal compression non-conductive film, or TC-NCF, to insulate each layer of DRAM. SK Hynix, on the other hand, pioneered an alternative to improve heat dissipation and production yields.\nYet Samsung opted to stick with TC-NCF and improve it, rather than considering other approaches. A company spokesperson said TC-NCF is \u201cwell-proven technology\u201d that it will use in future products.\nUltimately, the company modified the HBM design to address heating and power consumption issues, the people said. That led to the approval of HBM3 for Nvidia.\nSamsung said that Jun, since taking over, has prioritized the company\u2019s culture of collective discussion and persistence in solving problems. It added there has been \u201cno issue related to heating and power consumption in our HBM products\u201d and it has made \u201cno design changes\u201d for specific customers.\nSamsung\u2019s saving grace may be that much of AI\u2019s growth lies ahead. Tech firms like Microsoft Corp., Google-parent Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are all investing huge sums to develop their capabilities.\nSamsung has been producing HBM3 chips since the second half of last year, according to details from its quarterly reports. Companies like Google, which design their own chip capabilities, are expected to continue using HBM3 for much of this year. Samsung has started supplying HBM3 to Nvidia for its H20 chip, a product customized for China to meet US export controls.\nAs for HBM3E, the technology hit the market for the first time this year as Nvidia paired the SK Hynix chip with its own H200. Nvidia will keep using HBM3E with virtually all of its products through 2025 and chip rivals will stick with it even in 2026, Sanford C. Bernstein analysts said in a July report.\n\u201cSamsung is late, but the window of HBM3E will remain open for Samsung to catch up,\u201d the analysts, led by Mark Li, wrote.\nIn a sign of its tardiness, Micron Technology Inc. announced earlier this year that Nvidia had approved its HBM3E chips for use with the company\u2019s AI gear. Micron, which has historically trailed its Korean rivals in scale, is now claiming leadership in some areas of memory manufacturing and product introduction, a further sign of the erosion of Samsung\u2019s dominance.\nOne significant advantage Samsung holds however is its financial resources and production capacity. Once it meets Nvidia\u2019s criteria for approval, it can ramp up output rapidly, addressing shortages that have held back Nvidia and other AI advocates.\n\u201cMicron and Hynix don\u2019t have the capacity yet to support the entire market,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Silverman. Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang \u201cwants to encourage them\u201d because he needs more supply, he added.\nSK Hynix isn\u2019t letting up. It\u2019s in the rare position of stealing the spotlight from its higher-profile rival \u2014 its shares have surged more than 150% since the start of 2023, more than triple Samsung\u2019s performance.\nSK Hynix said last week it\u2019s accelerating production of HBM3E products to grab growth of more than 300%. The company also said it plans to mass produce next-generation, 12-layer HBM3E chips this quarter and start supplying a customer in the fourth quarter, a likely indication that certification from Nvidia is imminent.\nUnder Jun\u2019s leadership, Samsung is making progress. It developed its own 12-layer HBM3E technology and is working to get Nvidia\u2019s approval for that generation of chips, as well as eight-layer HBM3E. It\u2019s an indication of the market\u2019s promise.\n\u201cThis is a $71 billion revenue opportunity by 2027e (on our estimates), and growing, that did not exist two years ago,\u201d the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. \u201cThe key debate for Samsung is whether it can execute as a strong second source to Nvidia.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products\u2014and Broke Shopping in America\nHow to Calculate the Value of an MBA\nInside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter\n\u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship\nDC Welcomes Ex-OpenAI Board Member After Sam Altman Drama\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have exploded in popularity following the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. Their consistently rising prices have led industry leaders like Nvidia to enact stock splits, looking to make their shares more liquid and available to regular investors.\nBut Nvidia isn't the only way to bet on this exciting new opportunity. Let's explore why Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another soaring AI stock split that belongs on your investment radar.\nFormed by the 2015 merger between Broadcom Corporation and Avago Technologies, Broadcom is a diversified semiconductor company that designs and manufactures an array of information technology hardware.\nUnlike Nvidia, Broadcom isn't a big player in the market for high-end, general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) used to train and run generative AI algorithms. Instead, it gains exposure to the industry through custom chips tailored to each client's specific use case.\nFor data centers, opting for a Broadcom-designed custom chip probably has more up-front costs and commitments than buying off-the-shelf solutions like Nvidia's H100. But the trade-off comes with cost and power advantages, which can pay off over the long term.\nBroadcom boasts big-name clients like Alphabet (which contracts with Broadcom to design its Google TPU chips) and Chinese social media giant Bytedance, which reportedly aims to use Broadcom services to help ensure a supply of powerful processors amid rising tensions with the U.S. government. Opting for Broadcom's custom chips can help the Chinese company fit within tightening export controls that effectively block many of Nvidia's most advanced GPUs.\nIt's never a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket \u2014 especially if that basket is a hyped-up tech megatrend. While AI technology might transform the global economy, we don't know when that will happen, or if the current demand for AI chips is sustainable. Previous hype cycles like the internet ended badly for companies that overexposed themselves too early.\nThe good news is that Broadcom's business is diversified. The company provides semiconductor services for industries ranging from smartphones to enterprise networking. And while these are mainly mature businesses, they help stabilize Broadcom's operations.\nBut the company also has an exciting non-AI-related growth driver, VMware. Completed in 2023, the $69 billion deal was one of the biggest in tech history. It gave Broadcom more exposure to the infrastructure software business and helped send overall company revenue up 43% year over year to $12.49 billion in the second quarter.\nDespite shares jumping almost 470% over the last five years, many smaller investors are finally taking notice of Broadcom after management announced a 10-for-1 stock split that could bring its quadruple-digit stock price back down to earth when it goes live on July 15. Remember that this move doesn't change the company's market cap (the value of all shares outstanding) or its valuation relative to earnings.\nThe good news is that with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of just 28, Broadcom's valuation is in line with the Nasdaq average of 31 and cheap compared to AI-related alternatives like Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices, which boast forward P/Es of 36 and 54, respectively. This means the company remains a safer way to bet on the long-term AI opportunity.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $751,670!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": "  Fahad Saleem ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell.\u00a0Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer in his latest program talked about how the China factor is affecting US stocks. He said that companies that have exposure to China are getting hammered and he does not see that changing \u201canytime soon.\u201d\nCramer said that currently there are many \u201cpernicious forces working against the bulls.\u201d The CNBC host said many growth stocks are declining right when interest rates are around the corner. He said that companies that don\u2019t benefit from rate cuts are going down. Cramer also mentioned weak earnings reports which show companies having challenged client bases. Cramer mentioned a consumer products company that was recently hammered because of weakness in China.\nCramer thinks the problem in China is twofold: there\u2019s a government that does not like America or American businesses while the population is \u201ccash-strapped\u201d even if they \u201clike our country.\u201d\nCramer said \u201cChina is so darn complicated.\u201d He said at one point the Chinese government was \u201cso business friendly\u201d that Western companies thought it\u2019s \u201cinsane\u201d not to go there. But since the Trump administration, the country has been engaged in trade wars with the US.\nCramer said the Chinese government \u201ctook advantage of us on trade.\u201d\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 important stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each stock we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\nCramer in a latest program talked about several positive developments for Nvidia stock. A Wall Street analyst has said the stock will go to $175, while media reports suggest the company is making a chip for China that won\u2019t be \u201cprosecuted\u201d or \u201cpulled off\u201d by \u201cthis administration\u201d according to Cramer. But Cramer questioned the possibility of a China chip from Nvidia getting approval if Trump comes to power.\n\u201cA Harris presidency is much more benign for Silicon Valley than a Trump presidency. Do you think they\u2019ll be able to come up with a Chinese chip that Trump would approve of? You kidding me?\u201d\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has \u201ctriggered a mechanical sell signal\u201d based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) rapid run and soaring valuation have started to make some circles on Wall Street uneasy. New Street Research recently downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy and set the stock\u2019s price target at $135.\n\u201cWe downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.\u201d New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu said.\nNYU professor and valuation guru Aswath Damodoran has also been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has \u201cno idea what I\u2019m talking about\u201d or it\u2019s the market that just does not understand.\nAswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the \u201cdriving seat\u201d of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won\u2019t be as easy as the market assumes.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).\u201d\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Shares of semiconductor stocks fell sharply on Wednesday after the first major industry results came out from ASML (NASDAQ: ASML). Management is optimistic about the future of artificial intelligence (AI), which has pushed chip stocks higher this year, but still expects revenue to be flat for the year. \nNvidia\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares responded by falling as much as 7.6% in trading on Wednesday, Arm Holding (NASDAQ: ARM) fell 9.6%, and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) was off 6.2%. The stocks were down 6.7%, 9.2%, and 6.1% respectively at 3 p.m. ET. \nWhen stocks go up rapidly, expectations of the underlying companies go up as well. ASML is no exception and while second-quarter results were better than expected, investors were disappointed management didn't raise full-year revenue guidance from previously provided \"similar to 2023.\"\nNvidia, Arm, and Micron aren't competitors to ASML, but they are downstream in the supply chain and they ultimately drive demand for the company's equipment. Expectations have risen for these chip stocks and ASML is the first company to indicate they may not see the explosive growth investors are expecting.\nThere's a delicate balance between stocks pricing in growth and running so high that even a small guidance miss can crush stocks. Given the run in AI-related stocks, the market is going to pounce on any sign of weakness.\nThe Biden administration said it may ratchet up restrictions on companies working with China, including ASML and Nvidia. There are already restrictions on the equipment that can be sold into China, but limiting how workers can maintain equipment could curb demand even further.\nAs much as the U.S. has tried to disrupt China's advanced semiconductor manufacturing, many companies still rely on China for a large amount of revenue. If companies like Nvidia, Arm, and Micron are targeted, they could see a drop in demand just as they're ramping up AI demand worldwide.\nChina could ultimately be forced to create its own semiconductor tooling, which it's already doing, and AI chips, which would be competition to these companies.\nTaiwan, which is where most of the world's advanced chips are made, gets roped into this conflict because of its proximity to China and the country's claim on Taiwan itself. It's a tenuous position for chip companies and given the high valuation of these stocks it makes sense investors are taking a \"risk off\" approach today.\nThe tensions with China continue to ebb and flow and shouldn't surprise any semiconductor investors. I don't think the latest news presents any more risk than what investors knew about the industry a day or two ago.\nWhat's going to be more impactful is the demand for semiconductor equipment and chips as the AI boom matures. Investors are expecting Nvidia's revenue to more than double this year and double again in 2025. Arm is expected to grow 25% this fiscal year and Micron is expected to grow 62% in fiscal 2024 and another 52% in fiscal 2025.\nThose are high bars to clear and any indication they'll fall short will hurt the stocks. It's not clear if ASML's caution is a sign the industry isn't growing as quickly as hoped, but we'll find out as earnings are released over the next month.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Investors love to see key company insiders buying stock. It indicates they have confidence in the company's future. On the other hand, when insiders sell it can cause concerns that maybe they know something that outsiders don't.\nThat leads me to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The GPU maker's CEO, Jensen Huang, sold $296 million of Nvidia stock in July. Should investors be worried?\nHuang didn't trim his stake in Nvidia once or twice in July. He sold Nvidia shares 20 times during the month. There were only two trading days when he didn't sell any shares.\nAs you can guess from the total amount sold, we're not talking about small-dollar transactions here. Huang's sales of Nvidia stock made him between $13.6 million and $16.1 million per trade.\nDate\nShares Sold\nProceeds\nJuly 1, 2024\n120,000\n$14.7 million\nJuly 2, 2024\n120,000\n$14.7 million\nJuly 3, 2024\n120,000\n$14.9 million\nJuly 5, 2024\n120,000\n$15.3 million\nJuly 8, 2024\n120,000\n$15.4 million\nJuly 9, 2024\n120,000\n$15.7 million\nJuly 10, 2024\n120,000\n$16.1 million\nJuly 11, 2024\n120,000\n$15.7 million\nJuly 12, 2024\n120,000\n$15.6 million\nJuly 15, 2024\n120,000\n$15.5 million\nJuly 16, 2024\n120,000\n$15.2 million\nJuly 17, 2024\n120,000\n$14.3 million\nJuly 18, 2024\n120,000\n$14.4 million\nJuly 19, 2024\n120,000\n$14.3 million\nJuly 22, 2024\n120,000\n$14.7 million\nJuly 23, 2024\n120,000\n$14.8 million\nJuly 24, 2024\n120,000\n$14.1 million\nJuly 25, 2024\n120,000\n$13.6 million\nJuly 26, 2024\n120,000\n$13.6 million\nJuly 29, 2024\n120,000\n$13.6 million\nData sources: SEC filings.\nNvidia's CEO sold the same number of shares each time. Earlier in the month, his proceeds were higher because the stock was rising. Later in July, his proceeds fell as Nvidia's share price tanked.\nIs Huang bailing on Nvidia while he's promoting the chipmaker's prospects to outside investors? Not really.\nThe CEO's sales were all related to restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs). These are stock grants tied to Huang's compensation. RSUs are commitments by an employer to grant shares to an employee at a specified future date provided certain conditions are met. PSUs are shares awarded to an employee based on company performance.\nHuang regularly sells RSUs and PSUs. Other Nvidia executives and board members do too. However, these sales shouldn't be interpreted as reflecting a lack of confidence in the company.\nWhile $297 million is a lot of money, it's small compared to Huang's overall stake in Nvidia. As of March 25, 2024, he owned nearly 93.5 million shares with a current value of roughly $9.7 billion.\nThe bottom line is that there is no need to worry at all about insider selling by Nvidia's leaders. But should investors worry about Nvidia's recent sharp pullback? I don't think so.\nNothing about Nvidia's business or prospects has changed over the last few weeks. I suspect the company will announce another round of impressive revenue and earnings growth in its next quarterly update on Aug. 28.\nNvidia's story could get even better with the upcoming launch of its Blackwell GPU platform. Huang has said Blackwell \"will likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history.\" He'll probably be proven right at least on the first part of that statement.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has become the face of artificial intelligence and its stock has responded in kind. Shares are up 200% over the past year and over 800% since the release of ChatGPT, which sparked an AI tsunami. Yet there is a world of stocks that are outperforming Nvidia.\nWhile the technology sector provides opportunity with companies like Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) far outstripping the chipmaker\u2019s gains, investors should widen their lens even further.\nBelow are three fast-growing stocks that are outperforming Nvidia. They are not household names yet but could be a place to begin your search for long-term potential. Let\u2019s see whether these rocket ships are worth investing in today.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSource: Poravute Siriphiroon / Shutterstock.com\nWho knew raising chickens for eggs could be a monster growth market? Vital Farms (NASDAQ:VITL) proves it though, with its stock that are outperforming Nvidia in 2024. VITL stock is up 198% this year compared to a 149% gain by the AI chipmaker.\nBe careful where you get your data from though as Investor\u2019s Business Daily indicated Vital Farms rocketed over 1,800% last year. The egg producer, however, actually was up just 5% in 2023. The site, though, correctly notes the volatility Vital and other egg, poultry and meat producers face due to widespread illness outbreaks like avian flu. Vital suffered flock losses in 2022 and 2023 but says it can mitigate the damage because it has a network of 300 family farms it uses to supply its eggs.\nVital Farms is faring far better than industry giant Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ:CALM), which is the country\u2019s largest egg producer, producing 587,700 dozen eggs per hour at 43 different facilities. Its stock is up just 6% this year. In contrast, Vital sells over 8,000 dozen eggs per week at its retail partners.\nThe difference with Vital is it is an ethically sourced egg producer selling pasture-raised eggs. While there is a public misperception about what free-range, pasture-raised or cage-free really means, chickens are more humanely treated today than they were in the past when hens were crammed wing-to-beak in factories. Vital sells its eggs in 24,000 stores, a quarter of which are Whole Foods locations.\nYet it\u2019s hard to see Vital Farms holding onto its stock gains. It trades at 54 times trailing earnings, 4 times sales and 33x free cash flow (FCF), which is pricey for a commodities producer however ethical its practices.\nSource: pixinoo / Shutterstock.com\nWhen you fall as far as biotech Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) did there is little place to go but up. But the producer of Covid vaccines is soaring in 2024, with its stock outperforming Nividia with a 163% return. Virtually all of it came beginning in May when Novavax signed a partnership agreement with Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) to market its coronavirus vaccines.\nUnder terms of the deal, Sanofi will pay Novavax $500 million upfront plus milestone payments of $700 million that value the total agreement at $1.2 billion. Sanofi will also take a less than 5% minority ownership stake in the biotech.\nWhile that significantly de-risks an investment in Novavax, the problem is the market for Covid vaccines has greatly diminished. Growth has flatlined and Novavax has just a small percentage of the total.\nAccording to data from Oxford University and Y Combinator, some 917 million doses (including boosters) have been administered worldwide. That\u2019s only a few million more than in 2022. Of that number, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) account for 73% while Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) has another 17%. Novavax barely even registers with 310,000 doses administered. Barring another Covid outbreak, there doesn\u2019t appear to be much of a growth market here.\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\nThe third stock outperforming Nvidia this year is Redwire (NYSE:RDW), a leading manufacturer of space infrastructure for NASA, U.S. Space Force, the European Space Agency and space launch services company Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB). Its stock is up 152% so far this year.\nRedwire provides mission critical avionics, sensors, power generation, structures and more. It was recently selected by Rocket Labs to provide antennas and RF hardware for the Space Development Agency\u2019s constellation of satellites providing warfighters with unjammable communications. It also provided the cameras used by Intuitive Machine\u2019s (NASDAQ:LUNR) lunar lander.\nThe space stock went public in 2021 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) but splash landed hard afterward. It wasn\u2019t until last year that it was able to gain altitude again. It has been growing since, especially this year. Just last month it was awarded a contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for its SabreSat very-low-earth-orbit satellite.\nAlthough still producing losses on a GAAP basis, Redwire looks positioned for long-term profitability. As it just produced positive FCF for the first time, it is a foundation upon which to grow.\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia is significantly larger than almost every company in the world. However, that doesn't mean it will necessarily stay that way. A lot can happen over five years, and I think two companies will pass Nvidia in size over the next five years: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Both happen to be involved in artificial intelligence (AI) as well, and I think they make for better buys than Nvidia right now.\nFirst, let's figure out how much of a head start Nvidia has on these two companies. While Nvidia is third in the world's largest company race, Alphabet and Amazon are fourth and fifth, respectively. So, predicting these two will be larger than Nvidia isn't an outlandish bet. Alphabet's and Amazon's stocks would need to rise by 29% and 48%, respectively, to surpass Nvidia. Over five years, this isn't too much of a gap to close.\nBut what makes these two better picks than Nvidia? For the record, Nvidia is the best AI company right now. That doesn't mean it will stay in that position over the next five years. Any company involved in the AI arms race is currently loading up on graphics processing units (GPUs) made by Nvidia. This is to equip themselves with the most powerful computing devices available on the market so they can create accurate AI models quickly.\nEventually, this demand will be satisfied, and Nvidia's revenue may retract as fewer companies create new AI-dedicated servers and replace them when they are worn out. After this phase, much of the demand will center around who can provide AI models or infrastructure to run them on.\nAlphabet and Amazon are massive players in the cloud computing industry, so this sets them up well for the next phase of AI investing. Cloud computing is a vital platform in AI proliferation because it allows companies that don't have the means or the need for a supercomputer at all times to run heavy workloads like AI models. By outsourcing these workloads over the cloud to platforms like Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services (AWS), more companies have access to the computing power they need to run AI models.\nAdditionally, each has AI development tools and generative AI models that developers can access through these cloud platforms. Cloud computing will be the next primary beneficiary of the AI gold rush, and it's already seeing strong demand.\nEven before AI became a huge draw to these platforms, cloud computing excelled. However, each company has been doing phenomenally recently. In the cloud computing world, three stand out: AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud (ranked in terms of market share).\nAWS has a massive market lead over its competitors due to its first-mover advantage, and the mature business unit produces some outstanding numbers. In the first quarter, AWS had sales of $25 billion, with an operating income of $9.4 billion. That equates to an outstanding 38% operating profit margin, which shows how profitable these platforms can get when they have reached a mature state.\nGoogle Cloud is much smaller. Its revenue was $9.6 billion in Q1, growing at a 28% pace, and its operating margin was 9%. This shows how much room Google Cloud has to expand its margins, so this could become a large profit driver over the next few years.\nCloud computing will be the next primary beneficiary of the AI movement. As a result, I think the big three in cloud computing will be worth more than Nvidia five years from now (even though Microsoft is already larger than Nvidia).\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. AMD",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has skyrocketed since the start of last year. The debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT toward the end of 2022 wowed the tech world and highlighted the vast potential of the emerging technology. As a result, numerous companies have focused their businesses on AI, hoping to win a slice of a pie that Grand View Research forecasts will be worth nearly $2 trillion annually by 2030.\nIncreased demand for AI services has also increased the need for high-end chips to power them -- chips like the graphics processing units (GPUs) that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) develop. Nvidia's years of dominance in GPUs allowed it to snap up an estimated 90% market share in AI chips, leading to soaring earnings and stock growth. AMD got off to a slower start in the niche, but its share price has still experienced a healthy gain since January 2023.\nBoth of these chipmakers are compelling investments as the AI market develops and chip demand shows no signs of slowing. But is Nvidia or AMD the better AI stock to buy in July 2024?\nNvidia has become a Wall Street darling since the boom in AI kicked off -- its stock is up about 745% since the start of 2023. The company is the go-to chip supplier for AI developers worldwide. Soaring demand for Nvidia's GPUs has seen its quarterly revenue and operating income climb 93% and 149% during the past four reported quarters. Meanwhile, free cash flow (what's left of cash flow after capital investments) has soared 147%.\nHowever, the stock tumbled by more than 12% from June 17 to June 24. Some analysts have questioned whether Nvidia's stock has hit its peak. However, the company's tech dominance and vast AI potential suggest this dip will be temporary. The stock remains an investment worth considering for the long term.\nAs a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has positions in multiple markets. In addition to powering AI models, Nvidia's chips are crucial to running cloud services, consumer products like laptops, and customer-built PCs used for activities such as gaming and video editing. Meanwhile, emerging markets like self-driving cars and virtual/augmented reality are likely to boost demand for Nvidia's hardware.\nThese factors, in combination with the company's lead in AI, suggest that Nvidia's stock is a must-buy.\nNvidia's success in AI spurred AMD to jump into that segment of the chip business full force.\nThe company launched competing AI GPUs this year, and its data center revenue spiked 80% year over year in the first quarter. However, its total revenue rose just 2% during the period due to steep sales declines in other areas of its business. That result compared to Nvidia's revenue growth of 262% in the same quarter didn't do much to attract investors. AMD stock is up by just 7% year to date, while Nvidia's has jumped 125%.\nMoreover, history doesn't bode well for AMD when it comes to its efforts to compete against Nvidia in AI. Data from Jon Peddie Research shows that during the past decade, Nvidia's market share in GPUs has risen from 65% to 88% while AMD's has declined from 35% to 12%.\nAdditionally, consider the vast differences in these companies' financial growth during the past three years. Nvidia's revenue, operating income, and free cash flow have delivered triple-digit increases. Meanwhile, AMD's operating income and free cash flow have plunged, so it will have fewer financial resources to invest in its business and its efforts to compete in AI.\nNvidia and AMD are at different places in their AI journeys -- one company dominates the market and the other is still trying to find its footing. Often, a contrast of this type would mean the underdog has more room to run over the long term. However, AMD has already experienced significant stock price growth even as it has produced mediocre earnings. This has left AMD's stock considerably overvalued.\nNeither Nvidia nor AMD would be considered bargain buys at their current high price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios. However, Nvidia still offers the better value between the two stocks.\nIn addition, with Nvidia generating free cash flow of $15 billion last quarter compared to AMD's $379 million, the choice is a no-brainer. Nvidia is the better AI stock and is worth a long-term investment this year.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "This Stock Beat Nvidia in the First Half. Can It Do It Again?",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) added to its winnings in the first half, gaining about 150% after already climbing 1,300% over the past five years. The company dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, holding an 80% share, and also sells a variety of related products and services to companies launching AI projects. This has resulted in growth, with earnings advancing in the triple digits quarter after quarter.\nAs great as this sounds, though, Nvidia isn't the best performer of the first half. Another stock actually soared past the chipmaker, skyrocketing 188%. This company also operates in the AI space and has seen earnings climb -- and this player actually benefits from growth of Nvidia and other chip designers.\nCould this Nvidia- and market-beating stock offer investors a repeat performance in the second half? Let's find out.\nThe player that's wowed the market in recent times actually has been around for quite a while -- more than 30 years to be exact. I'm talking about Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), a maker of servers, workstations, full rack scale solutions, and other equipment crucial to the operations of AI data centers. Supermicro's revenue progressively rose over the years, but the AI boom marked a clear turning point, helping sales and net income to skyrocket.\nEarlier this year, Supermicro even reported its first $3 billion quarter -- that was the company's annual revenue level as recently as 2021.\nSupermicro has benefited from demand for top AI chips because customers generally need not only a chip but a variety of equipment -- and the company integrates these chips into its products. So when Nvidia or Intel, for example, launch a new chip, this creates demand for Supermicro's products too. To maximize the benefit, Supermicro works hand-in-hand with these companies, monitoring their development pipelines so that it can immediately include their innovations in its equipment.\nAnd Supermicro's \"building blocks\" process -- with most of its products sharing common parts -- also makes it easy to quickly produce equipment tailored to customers' needs. All of this has helped the company grow five times faster than its industry over the past 12 months.\nThere's reason to be optimistic this will continue because AI market growth is in its early days. Analysts predict today's $200 billion market will reach beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade -- and this should translate into sustained demand for Supermicro's products.\nOn top of this, Supermicro's direct liquid cooling (DLC) technology may serve as a new growth driver for the company. AI data centers generate a tremendous amount of heat, and this situation only will worsen as workloads intensify.\nBut Supermicro's DLC technology solves this problem, and customers now are taking notice. Supermicro's DLC solutions, increasing from zero market share to less than 1% in the company's 30-year history, could take as much as a 30% share over the next couple of years, The Taipei Times reported, citing the company's chief executive officer Charles Liang.\nAll of this means Supermicro's spectacular growth may be far from over, and in the second half of this year, Nvidia's release of its game-changing new architecture -- Blackwell -- and chip could offer the equipment maker a new boost. Supermicro recently offered a sneak peek of its Blackwell products and says it's focused on developing new generative AI and inference-optimized systems accommodating the market leaders' latest chips.\nNow, let's get back to our question: Could Supermicro continue to beat Nvidia and the general market in the second half? I think it's very likely this equipment giant will outperform the market, thanks to its growth prospects and position in the hot area of AI.\nAs for surpassing Nvidia's gains, it's possible. In spite of Supermicro's first-half increase, the company trades at a significant discount to the chip designer -- about 24x forward earnings estimates versus 46x for Nvidia. At the same time, the earnings-per-share growth estimate of 62% for the coming five years for Supermicro tops average estimates of 46% for Nvidia.\nThese points could attract investors and help Supermicro soar in the second half. But even if this top equipment company doesn't offer us a repeat performance in the coming months, that's OK. Supermicro still has what it takes to deliver earnings growth and share performance over the long term, and that's great news for investors today.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Amplify Energy Corp. AMPY, Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corp. GLDD and LendingTree, Inc. TREE.\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\nBull of the Day:\nI last looked at NVIDIA as the Bull of the Day after another stunning beat-and-raise quarter, reported on May 22, launched the stock from $95 ($950 pre-split) to my price target of $140 ($1,400 pre-split).\nWe knew the new Grace-Blackwell \"super-GPU\" was coming, but apparently investors and analysts needed to hear it from Jensen himself that the demand and deliveries were going to be off the charts by Q4.\nTectonic Shift to AI Economy\nThe other huge dynamic we learned on the conference call with Jensen on May 22 essentially put to rest the idea that \"cannibalization\" was about to occur as datacenter and LLM-builders would stop buying older systems like the GH200 because they wanted to wait for the GB200.\nHere's what I wrote to my investor group on May 23 as we sat back and enjoyed the rocket launch...\nTAZR Traders\nYou know the good news on NVDA: Wall Street continues to capitulate to the \"tectonic shift\" that has occurred with AI/ML/DL as more price targets play catch-up to our $1200...\nEven as I raise mine to $1400 for the next 18 months.\nAnd even as everyone and their Grandpa wring their hands about the NVDA market cap being worth more than half the world.\nIf you follow me on Twitter @KevinBCook you got to see the stunning \"chapter and verse\" from Jensen on the conference call yesterday... with all the analysts trying to find a fly in the ointment.\nI used Otter.AI to transcribe the whole thing and will share more over the coming days... what a sermon Master Huang delivered!\nIt made me coin a new phrase about how he abolished the fear of \"cannibalization\" during this Global 2,000 -- plus nation-states -- deployment transition from GH200 to GB200 systems...\n\"Multiplicative Integration.\"\nJensen didn't say this, but this is what I felt he was talking about. I actually posted his final 5-paragraph \"mic drop\" because it captured the essence of the technological transformation we are in for science, industry, medicine, education, and society.\nJensen & Co. systems have \"the transition\" covered with TCO (total cost of operations) fully seamless -- and bootstrapped -- on the upgrades to the Blackwell platform.\nCorporations won't have to worry about how the current GH200 systems integrate with the new Blackwell systems because Jensen and his top-tier CUDA engineers have already built that seamless transition into everything.\n(end of TAZR commentary excerpt from May 23)\nHuang's Law > Moore's Law\nThen in the first week of June came the annual Computex conference in Taiwan. And Jensen made it clear that the Acceleration of GPU computing was driving down nearly all Costs, including Energy usage, and providing powerful platforms for Science, Smart cities, and Simulation.\nThe oddly capitalized words in my previous sentence make up a new handy acronym I devised for technology investors to memorize when trying to understand the revolution that NVIDIA has birthed: ACESx3 is for Acceleration-Cost-Energy-Science-Smart-Simulation.\nThis is how I remember the power of NVIDIA, and the exponential reasons for staying invested in NVDA shares. And all of these letters stand for one of the most powerful ACESx3 innovations for human kind: advances in medicine and cures for our worst diseases.\nAfter Computex, and the NVDA 10-for-1 stock split which took effect on June 10, I raised my price target to $200. I had already told investors (and savvy traders) in May that the gap up from $95 ($950 pre-split) was likely never going to be filled (barring WWIII).\nHere was my commentary for Zacks TAZR members...\nNVDA to $200Posted on 6/10/24\nTAZR Traders\nThis morning we taped the Zacks Ultimate Strategy Session (ZUSS).\nMy Top Stock Pick was, of course, NVIDIA.\nAnd I tried to cram a lot (too much) into my 10-minute segment, but of course got lost along the way.\nI neglected to reiterate the emerging potential of Jensen's roadmap to $1 trillion in annual revenues by 2030 (a slide I showed you from last November).\nAnd then I forgot to speak this key statement from my weekend notes that sums up my \"No Cannibalization, Just Multiplicative Bootstrapping Integration\" (that I introduced last week during Computex)...\n\"ALL OLD and NEW DGX-GPU systems BENEFIT FROM CUDA SOFTWARE UPGRADES, SUCH THAT ALL PREVIOUS GENERATION CHIP-SETS ACTUALLY GET FASTER!\"\nThis is way beyond the \"backward compatibility\" thesis, so it gets lost on most analysts.\nThis is built-in \"acceleration multiplicity.\"\nTo say that the NVIDIA stack of enlightened software that extracts the most from the accelerated hardware is \"an exponential event-horizon for enterprise and science\" is the understatement of the decade.\nWe may not like what Meta, Google, and Amazon do with this massive data-power over society, but the genie is long out of the bottle.\nNow, we're aboard the ETI (Exponential Technology Innovation) Rocket that I previewed in 2017 in my Technology Super Cycle thesis.\nAnd as NVIDIA CUDA-DGX-GPU acceleration has surprised almost everyone to rival Apple and Microsoft valuations, it's also deliciously ironic that the \"Agree to Disagree\" topic for this month's ZUSS was...\n\"Ben Rains and Kevin Cook will Agree To Disagree on whether the U.S. National Debt matters to the U.S. economy and the market.\"\nWhen I last addressed this debate with some degree of interest, it was 3 years ago here...\nWhy the National Debt is Irrelevant\nIn any case, let's buy all the NVDA shares we can below $120 because my new price target for 2026 is...\n$200!\nNo one had a $2,000 price target pre-split so just ignore the Wall Street noise and stick with Cooker on the ETI that has yet to be seen!\nCooker\nWhat About Gloomy Goldman on the AI Bubble?\nYou've probably heard the hub-bub by now that Goldman research says the \"ROI on AI\" is non-existent. And that means of course that AI is a massive bubble ready to pop.\nThat's some cute \"could happen\" analysis. But it ignores what the Fortune 1000, the Global 2000, and the 20 largest nation-states are really up to: investing deeply for the future they see 5 years from now where if you don't have your own deep learning, automation and LLM expertise, you will be mere gold dust against your competitors.\nAnd as I've been predicting since February, the sales estimates for NVIDIA were going to cross $150 billion and head to $200 billion very soon.\nWell it finally happened this month with an unnamed analyst posting a high-Street peg of $180 billion for next year.\nI think it might be Tim Arcuri from UBS because on July 8 he talked about his bull case seeing $204 billion for next year. Here's what I posted on Twitter/X that day...\nUBS analyst Tim Arcuri leads the bulls with the call today for $204 billion next year, despite Goldman handwringing about \"no ROI from all those GPUs yet.\" Still building the field of dreams AI factories for science and innovation!\nBottom line: As I've been saying for 2 years, the analysts are still way behind the curve of what is emerging for NVDA sales over the next 3-5 years. Join me in buying every dip below $120 and if $100 scares you, buy more.\nBear of the Day:\nCrowdStrike is a premier cybersecurity firm focused on end-point threat detection and response.And before they became headline news this weekend, the Zacks Rank detected significant downward EPS estimates on June 8. On June 11, our Short List algorithm added CRWD shares and is currently posting a 30% gain (as of 7/22) after shorting at $380.Why is CrowdStrike Such a Big Deal?CrowdStrike's co-founders George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch were inspired by shortcomings in previous-generation security software technologies. In 2011, they focused on leveraging the network effects of crowdsourced data from their customer base applied to modern technologies, including AI, cloud computing, and responsive databases to adaptively detect threats and stop breaches.The company's Falcon platform has expanded its market opportunity beyond core endpoint protection through offering advanced innovations using machine learning and deep learning for real-time surveillance and mitigation.CrowdStrike became a household name after being called on to remediate the Democratic National Committee breach in 2016. This week, it's a household name for a completely different (and not great) reason as one of their \"software upgrades\" brought airline travel to its knees over the weekend.Fragile IT Systems?This what Nassim Taleb might call an \"anti-fragile\" wake up call for modern IT systems with built-in dependencies and extra complexity. In response to many posts on Twitter/X about the massive shutdown for Delta Air Lines, with people sleeping on the terminal floor in Atlanta for four days, I wrote this...My report last year \"State of Threat: Cyber Crime 3.0\" highlighted the state-sponsored sophistication of cyber crime and terrorism... and how hard the cybersecurity firms would have to work to keep up. Now they are so busy trying to stay ahead of the bad guys that systemic fragility gets built in.I have been a CRWD bull since $50 in 2019, and even as the valuation pushed some limits recently. Now I'll be looking for a spot to buy it again soon, maybe at 10X sales. After the 30% drop, it's now trading about 12.8X next year's projected $5 billion topline.But those numbers could be in jeopardy if customers reposition to other vendors. The good news is that most big enterprises won't just switch from a key embedded protection player like CrowdStrike. The bad news is that this will definitely hit earnings as the company makes remediations and invests more heavily to regain trust.State of ThreatIf you want a copy of my report from last October, where I explain the impact of \"Cyber Crime 3.0\", just reach out to Ultimate@Zacks.com and tell 'em Cooker sent you.Here's how I praised the company then as one of my top cyber picks when it was still trading under $200...CrowdStrike: This $44 billion leader in \"edge\" security for mobile, IoT, and government / military applications has been surging to new highs since their August 31 earnings report. As many employees and senior management continue to work from home and remotely, the threat vulnerabilities are multiplied outside of enterprise firewalls. CrowdStrike's Zero Trust solution is intended to prevent breaches in real time on any identity, endpoint, or remote workload.This Zacks #2 Rank is more expensive given the recent stock move, but with 35% topline growth this year -- and next year projected to tag $4 billion with another 28% advance -- it's going to remain on the top list for growth investors. It doesn't hurt that profits are following with an 83% jump to EPS of $2.82. And these are the guys, led by founder George Kurtz, who have deep experience in Europe and Asia and are watching every move that Russia and China make.(end of October report excerpt)Bottom line: I just shared this so you can see how I approached the growth and valuation back then. It looks like we'll be getting another chance at the stock at better bargain levels. So let's wait for the EPS estimates (and price targets) to come down and look for a buying opportunity before or after their Q2 report in late Aug/early Sep.\nAdditional content:\nRotation Trade May Prompt Stock Gains for AMPY, GLDD, TREE\nAt the moment, renewed interest in smaller domestic firms has led to a rotation out of mega-cap technology companies that had dominated gains in Wall Street. Interest rate cut prospects sparked off by falling inflation ignited a long-awaited rally among small-cap stocks that not only raised interest among individual investors but also billionaires like Stanley Druckenmiller.\nThis calls for investors to place their bets on growth-oriented small-cap stocks such as Amplify Energy Corp., Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corp. and LendingTree, Inc. for stellar returns.\nBig Tech Lose Their Appeal \nMarket participants have recently begun to move out of the favored tech behemoths, or the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, which have mostly fueled the market rally over the past year. The group, which consists of mega-caps such as NVIDIA, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon and Tesla has contributed to more than half of the broader S&P 500's return in the past year.\nHowever, these stocks have started to wobble as investors remain jittery about their stretched valuations and are drawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble. They believe that AI-driven revolutionary technology has primarily inflated the price of these mega-cap tech stocks, making them a risky bet for now.\nSmall Caps Are Now Wall Street Darlings \nIn a dramatic market shift, investors favored small-cap companies and other earlier detested sectors, including energy, real estate and finance. Small-cap stocks, in particular, have gained prominence as interest rate cut expectations increased.\nWith consumer price pressures ebbing amid a contraction in both manufacturing and service sector activity in June, the odds of a Fed rate cut as early as fall rise. The CME FedWatch Tool presently shows that 91.7% of market participants expect the Fed to trim interest rates by a quarter-point in the September policy meeting, up from a probability of 52% a month ago (read more: Rise in Rate-Cut Bets May Prompt Stock Gains for GOLD, KGC, FNV).\nInterest rate cuts, nonetheless, are a blessing in disguise for small caps. This is because any interest rate hike impacts small caps more than large caps due to a weaker balance sheet and higher debt levels. Notably, small caps have suffered for quite some time as the Fed kept its interest rates elevated to tame relentless inflationary pressure.\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump's improving prospects in the presidential race bolstered a small-cap rally since some of his policies, such as increasing tariffs and reducing taxes, bode well for smaller companies. Likewise, the Russell 2000 Index, which predominantly comprises small-cap stocks, has gained more than 6% month to date. However, the small-cap index continues to remain below its 2021 peak, a tell-tale sign that it has more room to scale upward.\nDruckenmiller Making a Bet on Small Caps \nBillionaire investor Druckenmiller was successful in predicting the unprecedented NVIDIA stock rally. He bought several shares of NVIDIA at the end of 2022 and sold many of them at the beginning of 2024 not before he made mammoth gains.\nSimilarly, Druckenmiller has now raised his bets on small caps, with the May filings showing that his Duquesne Family Office has acquired stakes in the Russell ETF, an indication that not only retail investors but also billionaires are hopeful about a small-cap rally soon. IWM has gained a solid 8% so far this year.\n3 Small Cap Stocks Set to Rally Hard: AMPY, GLDD, TREE \nGiven the positives, it's judicious for astute investors to place bets on small-cap growth stocks like Amplify Energy, Great Lakes Dredge & Dock and LendingTree. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\nAmplify Energy \nAmplify Energy is an oil and natural gas company. Amplify Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 17.4% over the last 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current and next quarters are 41.7% and 214.7%, respectively.\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock \nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock is the largest provider of dredging services in the United States. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 24.1% over the last 90 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 414.3%.\nLendingTree \nLendingTree operates an online consumer platform in the United States. LendingTree has a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 0.8% over the last 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 18%.\nShares of Amplify Energy, Great Lakes Dredge & Dock, and LendingTree have gained 23.4%, 21.6%, and 73.2%, respectively, year to date.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Has Nvidia's Stock Finally Peaked?",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been giving back some gains lately as investors have started to pull away from high-flying tech stocks. It's still at a market cap of around $3 trillion, and Nvidia remains one of the top stocks in the world, but investors are definitely more apprehensive about buying the stock these days. While its growth opportunities are plentiful, determining a fair valuation for the stock can be difficult.\nIs this recent pullback in Nvidia's stock price just a temporary setback for the chipmaker, and could now be a good time to invest in the business? Or is this a sign that Nvidia's stock has finally reached a peak and that more of a decline could follow in the near future?\nA dip in price just isn't typical for Nvidia, which has been the ultimate growth stock to own over the past year and a half. Its sales have been tripling, demand continues to be strong, and analysts remain bullish on what lies ahead in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn the past month, Nvidia's stock has declined by more than 3%. The Technology Select Sector SPDR fund has also been down more than 1% during this period, as it hasn't been just Nvidia that has seen a recent pullback -- other tech stocks have also been struggling. Amazon has declined by 1.5%, and Meta Platforms has fallen by 1%, as has Microsoft.\nThis recent bearishness doesn't appear to be limited to Nvidia's stock. And while these aren't huge declines, any sort of drop in value for Nvidia could ignite investor concerns, especially since this isn't a cheap stock to own.\nA big reason investors haven't been too concerned about Nvidia's rising valuation up until now is that they know the company's sales and profits will soar due to a significant increase in demand for its AI chips and other data center products. In its first-quarter results for fiscal 2025 (which ended on April 28), Nvidia's net income skyrocketed from $2 billion a year ago to now nearly $15 billion. It's not too shabby for a three-month period.\nThat type of explosive growth can make it easy to justify paying such a steep premium for the business, knowing that the company's profits will be quite rich thanks to AI. But it's also unlikely that Nvidia will continue growing at such a high pace. In the meantime, investors still pay a hefty premium for the business.\nAt more than 70 times its trailing earnings, the stock is priced a fair bit higher than its 10-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 57.\nInvestors appear to be willing to pay more of a premium for the stock than they have been in the past, but those limits have been tested in the past (back in 2021 when the P/E multiple was north of 80) before the valuation would end up coming down.\nA brief drop in price isn't indicative that there will be a similar pushback now, but it's a question that many investors are likely wondering about -- whether this may be the start of a much larger decline for Nvidia's soaring stock.\nHowever, I wouldn't be overly concerned, simply because its earnings are still likely to climb far higher in the future. Even if the P/E multiple investors are willing to pay for Nvidia stock comes down a bit, an increase in the bottom line could offset that and help Nvidia's valuation rise higher in the end.\nI don't think Nvidia's stock has peaked simply because it's still a leader in the AI chip market. While there will be rivals down the road that will try to take some market share from Nvidia in the future, it has built up such a strong position that it could take a while before that happens. As long as companies continue to spend heavily on AI, Nvidia's results may continue to remain impressive in the foreseeable future, given its dominance in the industry.\nUntil there's a crack in Nvidia's armor that suggests demand is starting to waver or there's an increase in competition on the horizon, this can still make for a good stock to buy and hold right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) recently hit a $3 trillion market cap and is now among the three most valuable companies in the world. Right above it in valuation is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), with a market cap of just under $3.4 trillion, while Microsoft is currently in the top spot at just over $3.4 trillion.\nThough Microsoft is a tech stalwart and a safe stock, I think Apple and Nvidia both possess better growth prospects in the long run. So which of them is the most likely to reach a $4 trillion valuation first?\nIt's hard to bet against Nvidia when you consider just how well its business has performed of late. The company is the leading provider of the artificial intelligence (AI) chips that other tech companies need to develop their next-gen software and models. And with AI infrastructure and development still in its early stages, Nvidia could be on the cusp of much more growth.\nThat's in stark contrast to Apple, which has been struggling lately to grow its top line at all.\nBut there is reason to expect that the gap between these growth rates will shrink. While Nvidia is a growth beast, it isn't likely to continue tripling its revenue on a year-over-year basis. As it starts lapping its latest huge numbers, it will become more difficult for it to keep its growth rate so high. And with so many companies loading up on AI chips, Nvidia may be punching above its weight right now. As more competing chips come to market in quantity and chip buyers potentially ease up on their AI-related spending, its growth rate could come down drastically.\nOn the flip side, Apple's growth rate should improve thanks to its recently unveiled Apple Intelligence, which will inject AI capabilities into its latest iPhones, Macs, and iPads. That will give users an incentive to get the latest Apple devices when they come out later this year, so it could be the catalyst for a strong upgrade cycle. As Apple dives deeper into AI and enhances its services, it has the potential to tap into more growth opportunities down the road.\nWhat may be the biggest impediment for Nvidia's stock to rally much higher in the near future is its extremely high valuation of more than 70 times earnings.\nTrading at a much more modest P/E ratio of around 34, Apple could have more room to rise, especially if its growth rate improves. Meanwhile, Nvidia's multiple means it will have a high bar to meet each and every time it reports earnings. That leaves the stock vulnerable to a sell-off should it have a quarter that falls short of expectations or if management offers a forecast that isn't sufficiently rosy.\nWhile things are going well for Nvidia today, that doesn't mean it will be able to maintain its current pace.\nBoth of these stocks make for good long-term investments, but if I were buying shares today, I would pick Apple over Nvidia.\nThere is a lot of excitement around Nvidia now, and that has me concerned that expectations for it may have climbed too high. Apple may not be as popular with growth investors today, but it shouldn't be counted out as it still has a lot more room for growth left.\nAnd Apple is the stock that I think will hit $4 trillion first, beating out both Microsoft and Nvidia.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia -- This Semiconductor Stock Is a Much Better Value",
        "Author": "  Lee Samaha, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia is a great company and a great stock, but it currently trades on slightly more than 50 times Wall Street's 2024 earnings estimates. That's fine for many investors willing to pay a premium for a high-quality growth stock, but for investors who are willing to take some near-term risk on board, ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ: ON) might be a better option. Here's why.\nSemiconductors are highly cyclical; they always have been and always will be. That's because the first thing their customers do when they see demand picking up is order chips to prepare for a production ramp. Conversely, when they see a slowdown coming the first thing they do is stop or cancel chip orders as they prepare to slow production.\nAs such, semiconductors are always early bellwethers of their end markets. However, not all end markets are made equal, and this year, the hot area of spending has been around artificial intelligence (AI) and the high-performance computing (HPC) chips necessary to power it. That's why Nvidia has done so well and why Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing continues to outperform, led by a strong recovery in its HPC sales.\nHowever, ON Semiconductor's key end markets, industrial and automotive, remain challenging, which is why the company's stock price is down 21% over the last year. I'll come back to that point in a moment, but first, a few words on the company itself for those unfamiliar with it.\nThe investment case is based on management repositioning the company for growth in exciting long-term growth markets, and that's best seen in its silicon carbide operations. Management has invested heavily in positioning itself in the silicon carbide business, not least by recently announcing a multiyear $2 billion investment in a silicon carbide (SiC) manufacturing facility in central Europe. Silicon carbide chips offer several benefits over traditional silicon chips, and notably at the higher voltages needed for electric vehicles (EVs).\nIn addition, the chip company has positioned itself in other exciting growth markets in new technologies where it has relatively high content, including factory automation, EV charging, renewable energy infrastructure, 5G, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).\nUnfortunately, while these end markets have great long-term growth potential, they are slowing in 2024. The impact of the slowdown is best seen in the company's declining sales and in the slowdown in its silicon carbide business. EV sales growth has tailed off as persistently high interest rates have made car loans more expensive. As such, automakers have pared back investment in EVs, and the company's sales have been negatively impacted.\nFor example, back in October, management said that a reduction in demand from one original equipment manufacturer (OEM) automotive customer would result in the company only hitting $800 million in 2023 rather than the target of $1 billion. Fast forward to February, and CEO Hassane El-Khoury told investors, \"OEM's latest EV plans indicate a more tapered growth signaling a SiC market growth in the range of 20% to 30%\" compared to market reports calling for \"30% or 40% growth for silicon carbide in 2024.\"\nIn a sign of a declining market, El-Khoury updated investors in April and said he still expected the silicon carbide total addressable market to increase in 2024, \"although at a lower rate than previously anticipated.\"\nWhile he noted that there were signs of demand stabilization, he was quite clear that \"I'm not going to call the bottom. I was very clear last time. I'll call it when I'm sitting on the top on the other side.\"\nAs such, anyone thinking of buying in needs to appreciate that there's potential for some negative near-term news flow.\nIf you can tolerate the near-term risk, the stock is highly attractive. After all, no one disputes that EVs are the future of the industry. All it will take is a lower interest-rate environment for EV sales to pick up, and so will EV investment. In addition, the other targeted end markets referenced all have excellent long-term growth prospects.\nMeanwhile, ON Semiconductor's valuation multiples are undemanding. Trading on 18.3 times estimated earnings, the company looks like an excellent value. While there's no guarantee it will make those numbers, and as El-Khoury notes, it's hard to forecast the bottom in the market, it's a pretty safe bet that ON Semiconductor's end markets and sales will recover in line with traditional cyclicality.\nGiven that all the company has to do is meet Wall Street estimates to look like an outstanding value, I would argue the risk/reward calculation favors buying the stock for enterprising investors.\nBefore you buy stock in ON Semiconductor, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and ON Semiconductor wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia 5 Years From Now",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia has been on an impressive tear lately, but many investors are concerned about the longevity of Nvidia's current position. It's known to be a cyclical company, so a demand reduction in its GPUs (graphics processing units) is coming, although no one knows when.\nWith Nvidia trading on much of its future prospects, there isn't much room for error. However, there are two companies that aren't as high-flying as Nvidia and could be worth more than it five years from now.\nThe two companies? Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which are the fourth- and fifth-largest companies in the world, respectively.\nWhen discussing which company is larger, I'm talking about market capitalization. Market cap is how much a company is worth and can be calculated by multiplying the shares outstanding by the stock price. Nvidia currently holds around a $3 trillion market cap, while Alphabet and Amazon are valued at around $2.3 trillion and $2.1 trillion, respectively. So, if Nvidia stays stagnant, these two would have to grow by 31% (Alphabet) and 45% (Amazon) to catch Nvidia.\nOver a five-year span, those aren't unrealistic outperformance rates, so the odds of either company surpassing Nvidia aren't that low.\nAlphabet has a strong case of being worth more than Nvidia solely on a valuation basis. I could talk about how Google Gemini is a fantastic generative AI model that is starting to pick up momentum after stumbling out of the gate or how Google Cloud is vital in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. But the argument is far simpler than that.\nCurrently, Alphabet trades at 24.5 times forward earnings. While this is still more expensive than the broader market's 22.3 times forward earnings (measured by the S&P 500 index), it's still far cheaper than the three larger companies in front of it.\nWith Microsoft and Apple trading at 34 and 33 times forward earnings, respectively, they garner a much higher premium than Alphabet.\nWhile some may argue that this premium is warranted due to recent execution, I'd argue that Alphabet is just as deserving over the long term. If you gave Alphabet a 33 times forward earnings multiple, the company would be valued at $3.08 trillion -- essentially the same size as Nvidia.\nAlphabet doesn't get nearly the respect that some other companies do in today's market. As a result, I think it has a strong case to be worth more than Nvidia in the future, as it isn't trading with lofty expectations built into the stock.\nAmazon's case isn't as straightforward as Alphabet's. The stock trades at 44 times forward earnings, nearly identical to Nvidia's 45 times forward earnings valuation.\nHowever, I believe Amazon's high valuation is a byproduct of its focus on efficiency. CEO Andy Jassy has been pushing for better operating efficiency since he was promoted to CEO. So far, Amazon excelled in this pursuit.\nSegment\nRevenue\nYOY Revenue Growth\nOperating Income\nYOY Operating Income Growth\nNorth American\n$86.3 billion\n12%\n$5 billion\n455%\nInternational\n$31.9 billion\n10%\n$903 million\nN/A\nAWS\n$25 billion\n17%\n$9.4 billion\n84%\nData source: Amazon. YOY = Year over year. Note: International was unprofitable last year.\nWith the impressive improvements in all divisions in a year, his plan is clearly working. However, Jassy isn't done yet. Although these profit levels are the highest they've been since the peak of COVID, Jassy believes there are more gains to be had.\nThis combination of revenue growth (Amazon grew its revenue by 13% in the first quarter) with margin improvement causes earnings to rise rapidly, making the stock appear cheaper if the stock price doesn't rise by the exact same amount.\nAmazon is a solid business with serious staying power. Because of its track record of execution and solid growth, I think it will be worth more than Nvidia in five years. Nvidia's business comes in waves, and although that's great for peaks, it can hurt it when times aren't so good.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stunning rally since the beginning of 2023 has made it one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalization of $3 trillion. The graphics-card specialist is now the third-most-valuable company globally, but an early investor in Amazon and Tesla believes that Nvidia still has lots of room for growth.\nTech investor James Anderson, who was a former partner at investment management firm Baillie Gifford, believes that there's a 10% to 15% probability of Nvidia's market cap jumping to a whopping $49 trillion in the next 10 years. That's a very ambitious forecast, given that the overall market cap of companies in the S&P 500 index stands at just over $46.5 trillion.\nLet's see why Anderson believes that a market cap of almost $50 trillion could be a possibility for Nvidia, and check if there could be even a slim chance of this possibility turning into reality.\nAnderson's $50 trillion market-cap estimate is based on Nvidia's data center revenue growing at 60% over the next decade. In fiscal 2024 (which ended in January this year), Nvidia's data center revenue shot up 217% year over year to $47.5 billion on the back of the booming demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Applying a 60% annual growth rate to that number over the next decade would pin Nvidia's data center revenue at a whopping $5.2 trillion in fiscal 2034.\nHitting a $50 trillion market cap, based on the data center segment's revenue alone, would mean that Nvidia would have to trade at around 10x sales at that time. That would be a discount to the company's current price-to-sales ratio of 37, indicating that Nvidia could attain the impressive market cap that Anderson is forecasting even if it trades at a significant discount after 10 years.\nHowever, achieving $5 trillion in data center revenue on the basis of the AI chip market alone doesn't seem even remotely possible. That's because the market for AI chips is expected to generate $257 billion in revenue in 2033, even after clocking a healthy compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24%. Nvidia's data center business benefited from the surging demand for AI chips, a market where it's the leading player with a market share of over 90%.\nEven if Nvidia continues to exercise such dominant control in this market, it's unlikely that its data center business will become big enough in the long run to help it achieve a $50 trillion market cap. What's more, Nvidia estimated that its total addressable market stood at $1 trillion a couple of years ago. Assuming it can corner all of that end-market opportunity in the next decade and trades at 8x sales in 2034, in line with the U.S. technology sector's average, its market cap may hit $8 trillion, at most.\nAchieving Anderson's market-cap estimate seems like an impossibility for Nvidia (at least for now). At the same time, however, we shouldn't ignore the fact that the semiconductor giant's huge addressable market means it could end up delivering significant upside in the future.\nNvidia's revenue during the trailing 12 months stands at just under $80 billion. So the total addressable market that the company is sitting on suggests it hasn't scratched even 10% of its revenue opportunity. Also, I mentioned earlier that the AI chip market that Nvidia dominates is set for robust growth over the next decade.\nHowever, this is just one of many lucrative growth opportunities for Nvidia. Fast-growing markets such as AI computers, digital twins, and connected cars are additional growth drivers that could help the company sustain its impressive growth in the future. All this explains why analysts are expecting Nvidia to achieve a healthy earnings-growth rate of 46% for the next five years.\nHowever, there's a good chance that it could exceed those expectations, considering its impressive share in the AI GPU and the gaming GPU markets, which gives Nvidia the ability to command stronger prices. Moreover, Nvidia is undervalued with respect to the growth that it's forecast to deliver. That's why investors looking to buy a growth stock can still consider buying this chipmaker, as it seems built for robust long-term upside even if it doesn't hit the lofty $50 trillion market cap in the long run, as Anderson predicts.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jing Pan ",
        "Text": "The story of Nvidia (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang is a compelling testament to the American Dream.\nHuang's journey began humbly, working as a dishwasher at Denny's, where he often had to clean toilets.\nToday, his company boasts a market capitalization of $2.76 trillion, and, as of this writing, he ranks as the 14th richest person in the world with a net worth of $99.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years \u2014 but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof \u2014 and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month\nThese 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 \u2014 and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\nNvidia initially gained recognition for its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), which revolutionized the gaming and computer graphics industries. However, it was the company's involvement with artificial intelligence (AI) that truly catapulted it into the spotlight.\nThe debut of ChatGPT in late 2022 marked a pivotal moment in AI, capturing the world's attention. Nvidia, a key player in powering AI advancements, quickly became a market darling as investors flocked to AI-driven opportunities.\nIn 2023, Nvidia shares skyrocketed by 239%, and the momentum has continued into 2024, with the stock up another 133% year-to-date. This meteoric rise reflects the market's insatiable appetite for AI technology and Nvidia's pivotal role in its development.\nHowever, the stock's trajectory has not been without fluctuations. Nvidia reached an all-time high of $135.58 on June 18 but has since retraced some of its gains.\nHuang\u2019s wealth is largely tied to his holdings in Nvidia shares. According to a March 2024 filing cited by Bloomberg, Huang owns more than 3.5% of the company.\nAs Nvidia's share price fluctuates, so does Huang's fortune. At the end of 2022, Huang\u2019s net worth stood at $13.8 billion. By the close of 2023, his wealth had surged to $44.0 billion, marking a staggering 219% increase within a year.\nAs the upward trajectory of Nvidia shares continued into 2024, Huang\u2019s fortune received a further boost. On June 18, his net worth reached an all-time high of $119 billion, coinciding with Nvidia shares hitting their peak.\nHowever, since that peak, Huang\u2019s net worth has declined as Nvidia shares have fallen. The latest data shows Huang\u2019s net worth at $99.3 billion as of July 29, reflecting a loss of approximately $19.7 billion in just over a month.\nRead more: Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year \u2014 but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free)\nFor tech magnates like Huang, their wealth is often intrinsically linked to the companies they helped create. For the average investor, however, diversifying their portfolio can help mitigate risks and protect their assets from the wild swings of a single stock.\nAs investing legend Warren Buffett once said, \u201cI do not think the average person can pick stocks.\u201d\nOne of the easiest ways to diversify in the U.S. stock market is through index funds. Buffett has long advocated for low-cost index funds, particularly those tracking the benchmark S&P 500 Index.\nHe has even revealed that after he dies, 90% of his wife\u2019s inheritance will go into \u201ca very low-cost S&P 500 index fund.\u201d\nBy investing in an S&P 500 index fund, an investor gains exposure to a broad range of large-cap U.S. companies, providing diversified holdings across various sectors of the economy. This means that if one stock tumbles, the impact on the overall portfolio will be limited.\nThere are quite a few options available, including exchange traded funds such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Investors can also consider sector-specific ETFs for targeted exposure to particular sectors.\nAdditionally, it's important to remember that diversification isn't limited to stocks.\nYou can also spread investments across other asset classes like bonds, real estate, and commodities.\nGiven that each individual has unique investment goals and risk tolerance, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial professional to help tailor your investment approach to your specific circumstances and goals.\nCost-of-living in America is still out of control \u2014 use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says\nJeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe \u2014 you may want to do the same in 2024\nStop crushing your retirement dreams with wealth-killing costs and headaches \u2014 here are 10 'must-haves' when choosing a trading platform (and 1 option that has them all)\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "Title": "Is It Worth Investing in Nvidia (NVDA) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Nvidia (NVDA).\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.24, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.24 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.4% and 4.9% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Nvidia, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs NVDA a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $2.68.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several key pipeline data readouts are expected in 2024, including from the obesity program, MariTide.However, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars.

        "Title": "2 Better Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Right Now Than Nvidia, According to Wall Street",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) share price has declined significantly in 2024. Yes, you read that correctly. At the beginning of the year, Nvidia's share price was around $492. Today, the share price is less than one-fourth of that amount.\nOf course, there's a good reason for this \"decline\": Nvidia conducted a 10-for-1 stock split following the market close on June 7. In reality, the stock has soared more than 120% year to date.\nIs Nvidia the best stock-split stock around? Not necessarily. Here are two better stock-split stocks to buy right now than Nvidia, according to Wall Street.\nHitachi (OTC: HTHIF) (OTC: HTHIY) is a Japanese conglomerate. It operates in a wide range of industries, including automotive systems, construction machinery, green energy, metals, technology, and more. The company conducted a 5-for-1 stock split effective July 1, 2024.\nThis Japanese stock has already been a big winner in 2024. Hitachi's revenue rose nearly 12% year over year in its fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. The company's profits jumped a little over 12%.\nHow much higher can Hitachi go? The lone analyst surveyed by LSEG in July who covers the stock thinks Hitachi has an upside potential of 49% over the next 12 months. That's more than double the expected gain for Nvidia based on LSEG's survey of 38 analysts.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) ranks as one of the biggest semiconductor makers in the world. The company also develops infrastructure software and acquired cloud and virtualization technology specialist VMware in November 2023. Broadcom conducted a 10-for-1 stock split following the market close on July 11, 2024.\nThe stock has also soared so far this year. Broadcom's momentum has been largely due to growing demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) products, especially AI accelerators. The VMware acquisition has also contributed significantly to the company's higher revenue.\nWall Street is exceptionally bullish about Broadcom. Of the 29 analysts surveyed by LSEG in July, 27 rate the stock as a \"buy\" or \"strong buy.\" The average 12-month price target for Broadcom is nearly 31% higher than the current share price. That's well above Wall Street's projected upside potential of 21% for Nvidia.\nThere's one common denominator for Nvidia, Hitachi, and Broadcom: AI should continue providing a major tailwind for all three stocks.\nIn March, Hitachi announced a collaboration with Nvidia on generative AI development. Two months later, the Japanese company partnered with Alphabet's Google Cloud to use its Gemini AI models. In June, Hitachi and Microsoft teamed up to use generative AI to drive growth for Hitachi's Lumada business software and services unit.\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan expects his company's AI networking revenue will soar 40% year over year in 2024. Customer AI accelerators is also a thriving and highly profitable business for Broadcom.\nHowever, I'm not so sure Wall Street is right that Hitachi and Broadcom will outperform Nvidia over the next 12 months. Nvidia's upcoming launch of its new Blackwell GPU architecture could be a game changer. CEO Jensen Huang certainly thinks so. Huang recently predicted that Blackwell be the company's most successful product ever.\nI wouldn't completely dismiss analysts' optimism about Hitachi and Broadcom. Both stocks might hit their 12-month price targets. But if I had to bet on only one of these three stock-split stocks, it would be on Nvidia.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $692,784!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Before July 29",
        "Author": "  Johnny Rice ",
        "Text": "No company in the last year has captured the attention of the investing world quite like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker dominated headlines as its stock price more than doubled since January, and with good reason; it's proven itself as one of the most important and central companies in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom \u2014 a role that has allowed it to rake in dizzying amounts of cash.\nAI, if its evangelists are to be believed, has the power to completely transform the global economy, a technological revolution on par with the internet. It's important to maintain a healthy skepticism in the face of so much optimism. Promises of this scale have been made before and they haven't always turned out well for the investors involved. Still, there is reason to think this isn't a simple hype bubble. The potential is certainly self-evident. The crux is whether these companies can deliver on that promise.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang will join Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg on July 29 to discuss the future of AI at a conference dubbed SIGGRAPH 2024. Hopefully, hearing from two leaders at the forefront of AI will shed some light on developments. Whether the event itself will have a material impact on Nvidia's share price is impossible to know, but there's certainly a chance the two would announce some sort of exciting partnership. Regardless, as the event approaches, let's consider three reasons Nvidia is still a buy.\nNvidia's revenue growth over the last couple of years has been nothing short of incredible. As the AI gold rush took off, the company was selling proverbial picks to the gold miners. Except these picks cost tens of thousands of dollars. Take a look at the explosion in revenue that happened soon after AI hit the mainstream at the end of 2022.\nThis revenue growth is coming as the company continues to drive down costs and grow its margins. Free cash flow (FCF) is the cash a company has to play with after all expenses are paid and capital expenditures are made, and is a great measure of a company's financial health. Nvidia grew its FCF by nearly 500% in the last three years; it's now sitting just shy of $40 billion. That is a lot of cash it can use to invest in the future, defend its market share, repurchase stock, or any number of things to make the business stronger and its stock more valuable.\nNvidia has the cash to help defend its market share, but even if it loses some to competitors like Advanced Micro Devices \u2014 and it likely will lose some \u2014 the market itself is so big and growing so rapidly that it may not matter. PwC \u2014 one of the \"big four\" accounting firms \u2014 believes AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Statista.com predicts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the total AI market of 28.5% through 2030. That growth that can propel Nvidia's business for years to come.\nNvidia's stock is trading at a hefty premium. The company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), one of the most common metrics to value a stock, sits at about 72 today. For context, Alphabet has a P/E of less than 30. When we look to the future, however, the picture looks a little different. Nvidia's forward P/E sits at 45, a more reasonable valuation, even if it's still on the high end. To me, Nvidia's place at the center of the AI boom and the future earnings potential that provides easily justify a premium.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $700,076!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n See our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nAs you can see below, NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt at April 2024, down from US$11.0b a year prior. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$31.4b in cash, so it actually has US$21.7b net cash.\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, NVIDIA had liabilities of US$15.2b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$12.7b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$31.4b as well as receivables valued at US$12.4b due within 12 months. So it can boast US$15.9b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nThis state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the US$2.90t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\nEven more impressive was the fact that NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 956% over twelve months. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if NVIDIA can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 82% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that NVIDIA has net cash of US$21.7b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$39b, being 82% of its EBIT. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for NVIDIA   you should know about.\nOf course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "Humanoid Robotics\nDevelopers Gain Access to New NVIDIA NIM Microservices for Robotics Simulation in Isaac Lab and Isaac Sim, OSMO Robot Cloud Compute Orchestration Service, Teleoperated Data Capture Workflow and More\nDENVER, July 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SIGGRAPH\u2014To accelerate humanoid development on a global scale, NVIDIA today announced it is providing the world\u2019s leading robot manufacturers, AI model developers and software makers with a suite of services, models and computing platforms to develop, train and build the next generation of humanoid robotics.\nAmong the offerings are new NVIDIA NIM\u2122 microservices and frameworks for robot simulation and learning, the NVIDIA OSMO orchestration service for running multi-stage robotics workloads, and an AI- and simulation-enabled teleoperation workflow that allows developers to train robots using small amounts of human demonstration data.\n\u201cThe next wave of AI is robotics and one of the most exciting developments is humanoid robots,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cWe\u2019re advancing the entire NVIDIA robotics stack, opening access for worldwide humanoid developers and companies to use the platforms, acceleration libraries and AI models best suited for their needs.\u201d\nAccelerating Development With NVIDIA NIM and OSMO  NIM microservices provide pre-built containers, powered by NVIDIA inference software, that enable developers to reduce deployment times from weeks to minutes. Two new AI microservices will allow roboticists to enhance simulation workflows for generative physical AI in NVIDIA Isaac Sim\u2122, a reference application for robotics simulation built on the NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 platform.\nThe MimicGen NIM microservice generates synthetic motion data based on recorded teleoperated data from spatial computing devices like Apple Vision Pro. The Robocasa NIM microservice generates robot tasks and simulation-ready environments in OpenUSD, a universal framework for developing and collaborating within 3D worlds.\nNVIDIA OSMO, available now, is a cloud-native managed service that allows users to orchestrate and scale complex \u200crobotics development workflows across distributed computing resources, whether on premises or in the cloud.\nOSMO vastly simplifies robot training and simulation workflows, cutting deployment and development cycle times from months to under a week. Users can visualize and manage a range of tasks \u2014 like generating synthetic data, training models, conducting reinforcement learning and implementing software-in-the-loop testing at scale for humanoids, autonomous mobile robots and industrial manipulators.\nAdvancing Data Capture Workflows for Humanoid Robot Developers  Training foundation models for humanoid robots requires an incredible amount of data. One way of capturing human demonstration data is using teleoperation, but this is becoming an increasingly expensive and lengthy process.\nAn NVIDIA AI- and Omniverse-enabled teleoperation reference workflow, demonstrated at the SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference, allows researchers and AI developers to generate massive amounts of synthetic motion and perception data from a minimal amount of remotely captured human demonstrations.\nFirst, developers use Apple Vision Pro to capture a small number of teleoperated demonstrations. Then, they simulate the recordings in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and use the MimicGen NIM microservice to generate synthetic datasets from the recordings.\nThe developers train the Project GR00T humanoid foundation model with real and synthetic data, enabling developers to save time and reduce costs. They then use the Robocasa NIM microservice in Isaac Lab, a framework for robot learning, to generate experiences to retrain the robot model. Throughout the workflow, NVIDIA OSMO seamlessly assigns computing jobs to different resources, saving the developers weeks of administrative tasks.\nFourier, a general-purpose robot platform company, sees the benefit of using simulation technology to synthetically generate training data.\n\u201cDeveloping humanoid robots is extremely complex \u2014 requiring an incredible amount of real data, tediously captured from the real world,\u201d said Alex Gu, CEO of Fourier. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s new simulation and generative AI developer tools will help bootstrap and accelerate our model development workflows.\u201d\nExpanding Access to NVIDIA Humanoid Developer Technologies  NVIDIA provides three computing platforms to ease humanoid robotics development: NVIDIA AI supercomputers to train the models; NVIDIA Isaac Sim built on Omniverse, where robots can learn and refine their skills in simulated worlds; and NVIDIA Jetson\u2122 Thor humanoid robot computers to run the models. Developers can access and use all \u2014 or any part of \u2014 the platforms for their specific needs.\nThrough a new NVIDIA Humanoid Robot Developer Program, developers can gain early access to the new offerings as well as the latest releases of NVIDIA Isaac Sim, NVIDIA Isaac Lab, Jetson Thor and Project GR00T general-purpose humanoid foundation models.\n1x, Boston Dynamics, ByteDance Research, Field AI, Figure, Fourier, Galbot, LimX Dynamics, Mentee, Neura Robotics, RobotEra and Skild AI are among the first to join the early-access program.\n\u201cBoston Dynamics and NVIDIA have a long history of close collaboration to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in robotics,\u201d said Aaron Saunders, chief technology officer of Boston Dynamics. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited to see the fruits of this work accelerating the industry at large, and the early-access program is a fantastic way to access best-in-class technology.\u201d\nAvailability  Developers can join the NVIDIA Humanoid Robot Developer Program now to get access to NVIDIA OSMO and Isaac Lab, and will soon gain access to NVIDIA NIM microservices.\nLearn more about the latest in generative AI and accelerated computing by tuning in to Huang\u2019s fireside chats at SIGGRAPH, the premier computer graphics conference, running through Aug. 1 in Denver.\nAbout NVIDIA  NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nFor further information, contact:  David Pinto  Corporate Communications  NVIDIA Corporation  dpinto@nvidia.com\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance, features, and availability of NVIDIA\u2019s products and technologies, including NVIDIA NIM microservices, NVIDIA OSMO, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, NVIDIA Isaac Lab, MimicGen NIM, Robocasa NIM, NVIDIA Omniverse, Project GR00T humanoid foundation model, NVIDIA Jetson Thor and NVIDIA Humanoid Robot Developer Program; third parties using or adopting NVIDIA products, technologies and platforms, and the benefits and impacts thereof; our collaboration with third parties and the benefits and impacts thereof; the next wave of AI being robotics and one of the most exciting developments being humanoid robots; NVIDIA advancing the entire NVIDIA robotics stack, opening access for worldwide humanoid developers and companies to use the platforms, acceleration libraries and AI models best suited for their needs; and the timing, participants, availability and impact of SIGGRAPH are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

        "Title": "Instead of Buying the Dip on Stock-Split Stocks Like Nvidia and Broadcom, Consider These 3 Semiconductor Stocks",
        "Author": "  Daniel Foelber ",
        "Text": "Stock market juggernauts Nvidia and Broadcom have pulled back slightly from their all-time highs, but their market capitalizations are still up enormously this year on investor excitement over artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia completed its latest stock split in June while Broadcom is scheduled to split its stock 10-for-1 on July 15.\nThose two are helping lead the tech sector to new heights, but they aren't alone. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), and On Semiconductor (NASDAQ: ON) may be even better growth stocks to buy now. Here's why.\nDaniel Foelber (Intel): There's no sugarcoating it \u2014 Intel stock has had an abysmal year. While most of its semiconductor peers have been riding party boats down the river, Intel suffered a 38% year-to-date decline. That made it the worst-performing component in the Dow Jones Industrial Average \u2014 even worse than Boeing with all of its woes.\nHowever, Intel is undergoing a significant makeover, both as a company and as a stock. In the past, Intel shares offered high yields, and the company was focused on slow and steady growth. But in spring 2023, it slashed its dividend by two-thirds and now yields just 1.6%.\nManagement's plan is to reallocate funds that would have been used to pay dividends toward long-term growth projects \u2014 namely, building fabs across the U.S. and investing in artificial intelligence (AI) products.\nIf the strategy works, investors could fare far better than they would have if the chipmaker had stuck with its prior formula, which produced high dividends but a stagnating stock price. However, anytime a company embarks on this kind of strategic shift, it often tests investor patience. Intel deserves to be in \"prove it\" mode, so it wouldn't be surprising if the stock continued to underperform its peers (at least in the short term).\nWhat the stock has going for it is an attractive valuation. Analysts' consensus estimates call for earnings of $1.02 per share in 2024 and $1.81 per share in 2025. That gives Intel a dirt-cheap 17.3 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio based on 2025 estimates. Granted, a lot could go wrong between now and then. However, the optimistic forecast indicates investors may not have to wait too long for Intel's earnings to soar.\nScott Levine (Micron Technology): When you're standing around the water cooler discussing AI stocks, it's likely you'll hear the same group of names mentioned repeatedly \u2014 and Micron Technology probably won't be among them.\nHowever, that doesn't mean it's unworthy of serious consideration by those on the prowl for compelling AI investments. The company is at the vanguard of developing memory and storage solutions that are suited for a variety of applications, including data centers and mobile devices.\nIn pursuit of growth, Micron is developing two new production facilities in Idaho and New York, the construction of which is being supported by up to $6.1 billion in federal grants funded through the CHIPS and Science Act. Micron expects the Idaho facility to commence operations in its fiscal 2027 (Micron's fiscal years begin in September), with production at the New York site starting as soon as 2028.\nThis positions the company well for the coming years since its high bandwidth memory products are already sold out for calendar years 2024 and 2025. While Micron provides a variety of memory and storage solutions, its high bandwidth memory products are especially noteworthy since Nvidia is a key customer \u2014 it relies on Micron's high-capacity memory solution, the HBM3E, in its H200 Tensor Core graphics processing card.\nLike many semiconductor manufacturers, Micron has been experiencing impressive growth recently. Whereas it reported $1.3 billion in operating cash flow for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, it generated $5.1 billion for the same period in fiscal 2024. As a leader in memory and storage solutions and as a key supplier to Nvidia, Micron should glow brightly on the radars of investors seeking worthwhile semiconductor tickers.\nLee Samaha (ON Semiconductor): ON Semicionductor's end markets are having a challenging year, and that's why its share price is down more than 11% in 2024 as I write.\nManagement made a conscious decision to focus on the automotive and industrial end markets, and in doing so, it exposed itself to the cyclical risk that both markets might be weak at the same time. That's pretty much what's happening this year. On the earnings call in April, CEO Hassane El-Khoury said he remained \"cautious about the second half outlook, but we expect customer inventory levels to normalize and the market to stabilize.\"\nEl-Khoury's cautiousness is unsurprising. Relatively high interest rates have slowed the growth in electric vehicle (EV) sales and are causing automakers to hold back on investment. At the same time, industrial automation companies are finding that their customers are taking longer than expected to work through their inventories and place new orders.\nWall Street's consensus forecast is that ON Semiconductor's sales will decline by 12.5% in 2024. However, despite that near-term doom and gloom, its end markets are highly likely to grow over the long term. EVs are the future of the car industry, and industrial automation is the future of manufacturing \u2014 at least, it is if you want to reshore production from low-labor-cost countries and take full advantage of digital technology in manufacturing.\nON Semiconductor trades at an excellent valuation today. It's not often you get to buy a growth stock trading at less than 20 times estimated free cash flow, and I think that makes this hardware maker worth buying for enterprising investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: Nvidia vs. Palantir",
        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "When it comes to stocks riding the wave of excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, perhaps no other stock has done it better than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). As the dominant AI chip design company, its semiconductors are in high demand as organizations scramble to buy chips to support their AI needs. Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) is another tech stock riding the AI wave, offering a product that has delivered eye-popping productivity gains with AI's help.\nOver the past year, both stocks have done extremely well, with Nvidia reporting 209% gains while Palantir rose nearly 79%. But investing is more about picking stocks based on the promise of future performance. Can both of these stocks keep riding the AI wave? If so, which has the better chance of staying up on the board longer? Let's take a closer look.\nNvidia has undoubtedly experienced a wild ride thanks to AI. Investors primarily knew it as a graphics and gaming company until the early part of the decade. As recently as fiscal 2022 (ended in January 2022), the company's largest source of revenue was gaming. But even at that time, the company's data center segment had become increasingly important as data centers became a fast-growing market for its GPUs. Additionally, it had begun developing chips specifically for AI purposes.\nWhen it became known that Nvidia's AI chips powered ChatGPT, the company's revenue shot massively higher. Thanks to the unprecedented demand for AI chips, the data center segment now accounts for 87% of the company's revenue. Consequently, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 28), revenue of $26 billion rose 262% versus year-ago levels. That increase led to a net income of over $15 billion, a yearly gain of 462%!\nAdditionally, consensus analyst estimates forecast fiscal 2025 revenue will rise by 98% before slowing to about 34% in fiscal 2026.\nAt such growth rates, the 74 P/E ratio might not deter investors. However, that may lead to investors overlooking the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 39 and the price-to-book-value ratio of 63. By comparison, competitor Advanced Micro Devices has a P/S ratio of 12 and a P/BV ratio of 5, an indication of how expensive Nvidia stock has become in comparison to its peers.\nGiven the elevated cost of Nvidia stock, the AI growth story of Palantir may appear more compelling to some investors. Palantir offers data products that yield analytical insights for clients. Its technology has long relied on AI and machine learning. The stock became more appealing to investors when it expanded from national defense-based analysis to developing a product that applied these insights to the commercial sector.\nStill, the game changer for the company came with the introduction of a generative AI platform called the artificial intelligence platform (AIP). It introduced this service using its AIP boot camps, and prospective customers reported considerable productivity gains after attending. For example, one (now) client claimed to accomplish more in one day than a hyperscaler had in four months!\nBecause the service is relatively new, investors may have time to get in before a possible buying spree in the stock. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue grew 21% yearly to $634 million. That led to $106 million in net income for Q1 versus just $17 million in the year-ago quarter.\nDespite the productivity gains, Palantir does not appear to be on track for Nvidia-like growth. Analysts predict revenue will grow 21% in 2024 and at the same rate in 2025.\nMoreover, the valuation metrics offer a mixed picture for Palantir. On account of its recent profitability, the stock sells at 227 times earnings. Its P/S ratio of 27 is not far behind Nvidia's, though the price-to-book-value ratio of 16 strongly indicates that Palantir is the less expensive stock.\nAs the metrics stand now, Nvidia remains the more lucrative AI stock. Although it sells at an outlandish price-to-book ratio, its rapid growth may ease concerns about overvaluation.\nIn comparison, Palantir has become a pricey stock, likely in anticipation of higher revenue from AIP. Still, the current revenue growth rate and forecasts do not match Nvidia's growth or point to a massive AI-driven increase in revenue. Investors should watch Palantir for signs of massive growth and reevaluate accordingly.\nStill, without such signs, Nvidia is more likely to remain the better wave rider of these two AI stocks.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Jensen Huang Just Sold Nvidia Stock. Should You?",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's always encouraging when a company's leader buys shares or when the company itself launches a share buyback program. This suggests management is confident about what's ahead, and that may encourage us to get in on the shares, too. When the opposite happens, though, and a chief executive officer sells shares, we might wonder if leadership is losing faith -- and whether we should follow the move.\nEarlier this week, the scenario unfolded at one of today's most-talked-about companies: artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Chief executive officer Jensen Huang sold almost $44 million worth of shares from July 15 through July 17, adding to sales earlier in the month. Nvidia stock has soared in recent times, rising nearly 150% in the first half -- and that's after the stock's quadruple-digit increase over the previous five years.\nAfter Nvidia's incredible run, should you follow Huang's move and lock in profits? Let's find out.\nFirst, it's important to put Huang's decision into context. It came as part of his Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, an agreement allowing insiders to sell a set number of shares at a fixed time. Insiders schedule such transactions at times when they don't hold important news about the company that could potentially spur share movement. All of this means Huang's sale of the 360,000 shares is simply a pre-scheduled transaction and isn't indicative of a particular sentiment about where the stock price is heading.\nOn top of this, it's important to note that Huang still holds an enormous number of Nvidia shares even after his recent transactions. As of the company's definitive annual proxy statement, reporting ownership as of March 25, Huang held more than 93 million Nvidia shares.\nStill, you may be wondering why Huang is selling shares even on a predetermined basis. We don't know the answer to this. But, considering his enthusiasm about Nvidia's prospects and the growth we've seen at the company so far, it's likely a move to lock in profits here and there -- without impacting the size of his holding by very much.\nNow let's get back to our question: Should you follow Huang's move? If you don't yet own Nvidia shares, Huang's transactions aren't a reason to avoid the stock -- as mentioned above, they aren't a sign of troubles or headwinds.\nNvidia's track record of growth along with its future prospects make it a great stock to buy and hold for the long term. The company is set to release its Blackwell architecture later this year along with its most powerful chip ever -- demand is surpassing supply, an indication that this new product could supercharge Nvidia's already strong growth. Nvidia also promises to update its chips on an annual basis, a pledge that could ensure the company's AI chip dominance for the long term.\nBut what if you hold a significant number of Nvidia shares? Should you then lock in profits? This depends on your investment strategy. It's likely Nvidia has a lot of fuel in the tank to power the stock higher in the years to come. But if you have a significant holding and would like to invest in other areas or are seeking to free up cash for other purposes, now is a fine time to follow Huang's move and sell some of your shares.\nReducing a holding doesn't necessarily reflect a loss of enthusiasm about a particular stock -- it instead could offer you the funds you need to further diversify your portfolio and score a bigger win over time.\nAll of this means that whether you decide to hold on to all of your Nvidia shares or, like Huang, let a few go, this top stock still could play a big role in the growth of your portfolio as the exciting AI story develops.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The most talked about stock in the markets in the first half of 2024 was no doubt Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). During the first half, Nvidia's stock delivered a total return of 149.5%, including dividends, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nNvidia continued to ride a steady stream of optimism, as analysts and industry participants kept upping their estimates for artificial intelligence growth this year and beyond. In its two earnings releases, Nvidia not only lived up to heady expectations, but surpassed them. Furthermore, the company announced its new chip architecture slated for release later this year, adding to the excitement.\nAnd as a cherry on top, the company also executed a stock split in June.\nIn its Q4 2024 earnings report in February and then its Q1 2025 earnings report in May, Nvidia trounced already-high analyst expectations for growth and profitability, with soaring revenues propelled by its data center segment for AI applications.\nMetric\nQ4 2024 \nQ1 2025\nRevenue growth (YOY)\n265%\n262%\nData center segment growth (YOY)\n409%\n427%\nAdjusted earnings per share (pre-split)\n$5.16\n$6.12\nData source: Nvidia press releases. YOY = year over year.\nNvidia was remarkably able to accelerate its data center revenue growth in Q1 of 2025, even though it was lapping the blockbuster quarter recorded in May 2023. Clearly, cloud companies and enterprises are falling all over themselves to buy Nvidia chips as they race to build the best and most accurate large language models.\nOutside of financial releases, during the first half, Nvidia held its GTC Developer Conference in March, during which it unveiled its new Blackwell data center chip. Blackwell will be the successor to Hopper, which is Nvidia's current AI chip garnering so much interest.\nBlackwell appeared to generate a lot of excitement, with CEO Jensen Huang boasting Blackwell packs 2.5 times the performance of Hopper for training applications, and between five and 30 times the performance for inference, depending on the networking technology and size of the GPU cluster.\nAfter blockbuster earnings and the exciting announcement of Blackwell spurred increased analyst estimates for 2025, Nvidia decided to execute a 10-for-1 stock split on June 10. While splits don't increase or decrease the value of a company, it can potentially lure in retail investors or Nvidia employees that can't trade fractional shares in their brokerage accounts.\nThe split seemed to give Nvidia one final big push to become the most valuable company in the world on June 18, briefly surpassing Microsoft in market cap, before falling back into a close third place.\nAfter an historic multiyear run, it is hard to see how Nvidia can keep topping itself. Furthermore, its sky-high valuation now leaves it vulnerable to any setback, whether it's a slowdown in AI investment or new competitive threats.\nHowever, none of that has shown up in the numbers to date, and companies appear to be continuing robust investment in the AI space as of now. Blackwell could keep the momentum going later this year, and a breakthrough in AI capabilities, perhaps artificial general intelligence (AGI), in the years ahead could very well keep Nvidia's stock going up and to the right. But a lot of good news is baked in now, so investors should remain extra cognizant of emerging news in the AI space.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock continued to advance in last month's trading. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price closed out June's trading up 12.7%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. It's now up roughly 159% year to date.\nNvidia stock has been on an incredible rally thanks to strong earnings results and excitement about untapped AI opportunities on Wall Street. The stock continued to receive a valuation boost thanks to favorable analyst coverage in June. Shares also benefited from bullish momentum for the broader market in the period.\nThe S&P 500 index's level closed out June's trading up roughly 3.5%, and Nvidia's share price also climbed in conjunction with the bullish trend. Notably, there wasn't much in the way of dramatic, business-specific news for the company last month. But an array of analysts issued upward price-target revisions for the stock, and overall demand indicators in the AI space continued to look promising.\nTruist published a note on June 27, raising its one-year price target on Nvidia stock from $128 per share to $140 per share. The firm maintained a buy rating on the stock. The day before, Citigroup analyst Atif Malik published a note maintaining a buy rating on the stock and increasing his one-year target on the stock from $126.\nMeanwhile, Rosenblatt was even more effusively bullish earlier in the month. The firm raised its one-year price target from $140 per share to $200 per share thanks to the strength of its existing and upcoming processor platforms. If the stock were to hit Rosenblatt's target, that would suggest upside of roughly 56% compared to the stock's closing price.\nNvidia is the leading provider of graphics processing units (GPUs) that are used to power advanced artificial intelligence applications. As demand for AI services and other cloud computing technologies have surged, Nvidia has seen incredible sales and earnings growth. In turn, this has helped power massive growth for the company's valuation. Nvidia currently has a market cap of roughly $3.04 trillion and ranks as the world's third most valuable company, trailing behind only Microsoft and Apple.\nNvidia stock has continued to gain ground early in July's trading. The company's share price is up 3.7% in the month so far. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index's level is up roughly 2.1%.\nFor the second quarter of its current fiscal year, which concludes at the end of this month, Nvidia is guiding for revenue of roughly $28 billion. If the processing specialist were to hit that target, it would mean delivering growth of roughly 107% compared to results in the prior-year period. It would also mean delivering sequential quarterly growth of roughly 8% compared to the $26 billion in sales the business posted in the first quarter of the current fiscal year.\nNvidia is the clear-cut leader in the advanced GPU market, and it looks poised to enjoy strong demand tailwinds and retain top position in the AI processor space for the foreseeable future.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Missed Out on Nvidia? Billionaires Are Buying These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Hand Over Fist",
        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The surge in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks has not escaped the attention of billionaires. As opportunities emerge, investing disclosure requirements show they have deployed significant amounts of capital into AI stocks like Nvidia.\nThis is important because some investors follow the lead of these top-tier investors and mimic their transactions hoping for similar results. While these billionaires buy stocks for many reasons that have little to do with the investing goals of their followers, fortunately, their positions do occasionally benefit average investors, especially if they happen to pick some solid stocks to get behind.\nLet's take a look at three billionaires and explore why they took positions in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The exercise might lead to some insight that can be useful to your investing journey.\nAt first glance, investors may find it puzzling that Appaloosa Management, the fund run by billionaire David Tepper, took a position in Alibaba. In 2022, the stock faced a delisting threat when the Chinese company resisted allowing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to see its internal financial audits because of its association with the Chinese Communist Party. Although the U.S. and China eventually resolved that issue, the tenuous relationship between the countries put tremendous pressure on the stock.\nAs a result of the turmoil, Alibaba's stock price fell to almost 20% less than its initial public offering (IPO) price from 10 years ago. This drop comes despite Alibaba's net income more than tripling over that time. That caused its P/E ratio to fall briefly into the single digits, and its current earnings multiple of 18 is far below any comparable conglomerate.\nWith the stock trading at a heavily discounted price, Tepper increased the size of his Alibaba position by more than 11,000% over the last year. The markets may vindicate this move over time. The stock price has remained steady so far this year, though it is down about 75% from its 2020 high.\nStill, if Alibaba can find a way to ease investor concerns, Tepper's fund and those who invest along with him could experience a significant payday as the stock finally prices in its growing profits.\nAlphabet has been a top AI innovator since it introduced the technology to its Google Search platform in 2001. Nonetheless, AI investors soured on the stock when OpenAI introduced a vastly improved version of ChatGPT in early 2023, creating the impression that the Google parent was behind the curve.\nBillionaire investors like Bill Ackman saw this as a buying opportunity, so much so that 13% of his Pershing Square portfolio is tied up in this stock. As late as the fourth quarter of 2022, Pershing Square did not own any Alphabet stock.\nBuying at the time Pershing Square did may have been the right move. More recently, Alphabet has responded with its own generative AI product, Google Gemini. It has also combined its AI research under the Google DeepMind umbrella. Considering its $108 billion in liquidity, it will likely buy any AI innovation it cannot invent in-house.\nAdditionally, despite perceptions, the stock has risen by around 60% over the last year, and its 29 P/E ratio makes it the most inexpensive company with a market cap above $2 trillion. That positions Alphabet to offer both safety and a higher likelihood of further gains.\nThe opportunity in Microsoft was of particular interest to Stanley Druckenmiller, the manager of the Duquesne Family Office fund. He saw that Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, had returned the tech giant to prominence as a leader in cloud computing.\nSucceeding in the cloud today means leading in AI. Druckenmiller began buying shares at the low point of the 2022 bear market and increased the purchases as Microsoft's partnership with generative AI specialist OpenAI came to light. Now, it makes up around 11% of the Duquesne fund.\nThe company built on that deal, integrating search engine Bing with ChatGPT to better enable it to compete with Google Search. Additionally, it launched Copilot, an AI-powered chatbot that combines the ChatGPT large language model and Microsoft's tools to create deliverables on command through one's natural language.\nAmid its innovations, it holds around $80 billion in liquidity, giving it tremendous optionality. Indeed, optimism around AI has helped Microsoft stock rise by nearly 40% over the last year.\nAt a P/E ratio of about 39, Microsoft has become a moderately valued AI stock, but given its resources and leadership in AI, the stock should continue to rise over time.\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETF featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL.\nNVIDIA Corporation has experienced an impressive 146.6% surge in its stock price year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 Generalindustry and The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF\u2019s gains of 106.3% and 19.1%, respectively. This YTD performance makes the graphic processing unit (GPU) maker the third publicly traded U.S. company alongside Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc., which currently have a valuation of more than $3 trillion.\nWith a market capitalization of $3.414 trillion as of Jul 2, Microsoft is the most valuable company in the world. Apple holds the second spot with a market capitalization of $3.378 trillion, while NVIDIA is in the third position with a market capitalization of $3.058 trillion.\nAs a leading player in the semiconductor industry, NVIDIA has benefited from its dominance in GPUs and strategic expansion into artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and autonomous vehicles. Given this remarkable growth, the question arises whether it is too late to buy into NVIDIA or if there is still room for further appreciation.\nNVIDIA's remarkable stock performance has been primarily driven by the anticipation that the company will reap substantial benefits from the growing investments in generative AI. Given NVIDIA's leading position in this space and the vast opportunities generative AI presents, the stock seems poised to maintain its upward trajectory throughout the year.\nThe increasing demand for workflow modernization across various industries is expected to elevate the need for generative AI applications. According to a recent report by Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is projected to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.\nHowever, generative AI requires extensive expertise for content creation and significant computational power. As a result, enterprises developing generative AI-based applications will need to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\nNVIDIA's next-generation chips, renowned for their high computing power, are likely to become the preferred choice for enterprises. The company\u2019s GPUs are already widely used in AI models, which is expanding NVIDIA\u2019s presence in emerging markets such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\nThe generative AI revolution is expected to drive substantial demand for NVIDIA's next-generation, high-computing power chips. With the increasing AI investments in the data center sector, NVIDIA anticipates its second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues to reach $28 billion from $13.51 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nNVIDIA's strong product portfolio, leadership in AI and relentless innovation present a compelling investment opportunity. Moreover, the shares of NVIDIA are trading above the 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend.\nThe company enjoys high market esteem, and savvy investors should consider leveraging NVDA\u2019s potential for sustained long-term growth. NVIDIA boasts an impressive long-term expected earnings growth rate of 37.6%, significantly outpacing the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s growth rate of 18.9%. This semiconductor company\u2019s earnings have consistently exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 24%.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $117.55 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of approximately 93%. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by a penny to $2.53 per share over the past seven days, which calls for year-over-year growth of 113.4%.\nFinancially, NVIDIA is on solid ground, with ample cash reserves that provide a cushion against market volatility. As of Apr 28, 2024, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $31.44 billion, up from $25.98 billion on Jan 28, 2024.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s stock trades at a one-year forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23.01, which is higher than the Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s forward P/S multiple of 19.2. While this might be perceived as a risk, the premium is justified due to NVIDIA's consistent financial performance and substantial growth prospects in emerging sectors such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and currently boasts a Growth Scoreof A, making it a highly attractive investment option, according to Zacks' proprietary methodology. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Greg McKenna ",
        "Text": "Global chip stocks from AI giant Nvidia to manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductors (TSMC) and ASML tumbled Wednesday. The drop came as the Biden administration weighed tighter export controls to stymie China and former President Donald Trump made comments that sparked fresh doubt about America\u2019s commitment to defend Taiwan. Shares of Nvidia, the third-largest company in the U.S. by market capitalization, were down over 6% as of Wednesday afternoon.\nThe U.S. stock of Nvidia's main supplier, TSMC, was down over 7%. Shares of Tokyo Electron and Netherlands-based ASML dropped 11% and 12%, respectively, as the U.S. ramped up the pressure to prevent both companies from continuing to provide China with advanced semiconductor technology.\nConcerns over the chip sector mounted in part due to reports the Biden administration may invoke the foreign direct product rule, a measure that allows the country to impose severe controls on any foreign-manufactured products that incorporate even the smallest amount of American technology. The administration told allies, particularly in Tokyo and the Hague, that the rule's implementation was a likely outcome unless those countries tightened their own chip-policies toward China, according to Bloomberg.\nNegative sentiment was already swirling after Trump said, \u201cTaiwan should pay us for defense,\u201d in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek published on Tuesday. The comments from the Republican presidential nominee, whose odds of beating Biden in November jumped on the world\u2019s largest prediction market after Saturday\u2019s assassination attempt, loom large because of the self-governing island\u2019s semiconductor dominance.\nAround 92% of the world\u2019s most advanced chip manufacturing capacity is located in Taiwan, according to the U.S International Trade Commission. TSMC, the world\u2019s largest chip manufacturer, is the predominant supplier for Nvidia's H100GPUs \u2014 the chips at the heart of the AI boom. \nUnlike other designers, Nvidia does not manufacture any of its own chips. Shares of GlobalFoundries, a potential beneficiary of continued efforts to bolster onshore U.S. chip production, were up almost 7% at the time of publication.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Adrian Volenik ",
        "Text": "Elon Musk recently spoke at an event, sharing his thoughts on Tesla\u2019s future and the impact of artificial intelligence (AI). He compared Tesla\u2019s current situation to Nvidia\u2019s before its stock surge, predicting that companies strong in AI will dominate the market.\nDon't Miss:\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in a house-printing startup who\u2019s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry.\nDon\u2019t miss the real AI boom \u2013 here\u2019s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\nMusk explained that Tesla is on the brink of significant growth, similar to Nvidia, saying, \u201cI do feel like maybe ... Tesla\u2019s kind of in a phase right now, like similar to what Nidia was in before ... Nvidia stock went bananas.\u201d\nHe also praised Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, saying, \u201cI have to say like Nvidia deserves the valuation ... they\u2019ve got ... Jensen and his team have done an amazing job.\u201d However, he emphasized that companies with strong AI capabilities will see their value increase more than those without. \u201cAny kind of AI company that is strong in AI is just going to be crazy.\u201d\nSee Also: Don\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\nA major part of Tesla's AI strategy is full self-driving (FSD) technology. Musk stressed how this could change car usage because, according to him, cars are used about 10 hours a week, but with self-driving, they could be used up to 168 hours a week.\n\u201cThat would be a 10x increase in the productivity of the car, but it costs the same,\u201d Musk said before continuing, \u201cYou go from ... 20, 25% margins to 90% margins. It\u2019s insane.\u201d\nHe went on to explain that when cars can drive themselves, Tesla owners could make money by sharing the car\u2019s earnings. In other words, your car could give rides to people when you\u2019re not using it, and you would get a portion of the money it makes. This extra income could be much more than what you pay for your car loan or lease and is in line with previous Musk statements on the subject.\nSee Also: Here\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\nMusk also discussed Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus. He believes these robots could become important in different industries and homes. \u201cThe market for humanoid robots is in excess of 10 billion units,\u201d Musk said, predicting high demand for these robots.\n\u201c[That\u2019s] more than the number of humans because people will each want one, and then there\u2019ll be others that are involved in industry ... if they do sell even at a volume for $20,000, that\u2019s $20 trillion, so it\u2019s like I mean it\u2019s just bananas numbers,\u201d further explained the Tesla CEO.\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nWhile Musk is optimistic about Tesla\u2019s future and AI\u2019s potential, there are several reasons his predictions might not come true.\nFirst, there are regulatory hurdles. Getting approval for fully self-driving cars involves complex rules and regulations, which can delay or even stop the widespread use of self-driving cars.\nSecond, there are technical challenges. Creating AI that is reliable and safe for self-driving cars and robots is very difficult. Any setbacks in this area could slow down Tesla\u2019s progress.\nThird, there is market competition. The AI field is very competitive, with many companies investing a lot of money. Tesla will face strong competition from other tech giants and startups.\nFinally, economic factors play a role. Economic downturns or changes in the market could impact Tesla\u2019s stock and overall growth.\nRead Next:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion \u2013 they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nDon\u2019t miss the real AI boom \u2013 here\u2019s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Elon Musk Says Tesla Now In A Similar Position Nvidia Was In Before Its Stock 'Went Bananas' \u2013 Thinks Strong AI Companies Will Dwarf Others originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Author": "  Asra Isar ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of Billionaire Phillipe Laffont\u2019s Top 10 \u201cMostly AI\u201d Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Philippe Laffont's other stock picks.\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont is a Founder & Portfolio Manager at Coatue Management, L.L.C. His fund\u2019s top 10 holdings comprise of mostly tech stocks which depicts his love for technology. His thirst for technology was such that after graduating from MIT with a computer science degree he applied for a job at Apple multiple times but was rejected every time. This pushed him towards another calling, which was to manage a hedge fund and its holdings.\nPhilippe Laffont\u2019s journey towards investing started when he moved to Spain where he started working at McKinsey. It was at this time when he learned about the \u201cboom of the PC\u201d and about the three pioneers of PC industry namely IBM, Dell and Microsoft. He decided to invest in these stocks which churned out more money than he was earning at that time. This led to his endeavors as an investor. In order to learn more about being an investor he got a chance to work at a mutual fund without pay where he learned about different terminologies related to the industry to \u201cget his foot in the door\u201d.\nAfter his employment ended in Julian Robertson\u2019s organization, he moved on to gather funds to start investing from his friends and family but most of his funds came from professional brokers and people who admired his entrepreneurial spirit. This led to the launch of his company on January 1, 2000, with $50 million at its disposal and the fund's AUM now stands at $50 billion. His investment philosophy is to provide longevity and good returns for the investors; and to have investors that would bet on him for the long term. Philippe Laffont\u2019s philosophy of helping out people is visible in his efforts to advise people on investing and he believes in helping any new tech \u201ckid\u201d that could become the next Tiktok.\nIn his interview at the Bloomberg Invest Philippe Laffont said that he is conflicted about whether small or big companies will be the AI winners. According to him the history of technology indicates that the big gets bigger but new companies have also made it through like Facebook or TikTok. He thinks that AI isn't overhyped and the valuations aren't out of whack right now. Here is what he said:\n\"It's true that the mentions of AI in every TV and and written form is very high. And so one could say, Wow, if everybody talks about it, it must be priced in. And the only reason why more positive is I remember when I invested in Apple in 2009 when the iPhone first came out and for years people told me, Why are you invested in Apple? Everybody talks about Apple. And obviously it had an incredible run. So I actually think that sometimes because someone speaks a lot about something, it might be actually a good sign versus an overhyped sign.\"\nPhilippe Laffont thinks the next phase of AI will be real estate with data centers and especially utilities with power. Another phase of AI, according to Philippe Laffont would be robots with artificial brains called humanoids. The technology hedge fund manager also made the following prediction which has a huge implication for the semiconductor stocks:\n\"I've made a lot of mistakes, You know, betting on these new technologies like AR/VR turns out to be not so big. 3D printing turns out to be not so big. My estimate is $100 trillion was invested in today's dollar in the PC, CPU based infrastructure. All this is going to get ripped out to put $100 trillion or more in our GPU based infrastructure.\"\nOur Methodology\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of Coatue Management at the end of the first quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the first quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) justified its growth expectation of over 100% this year and 32% next year when it recently revealed three accelerators \u2013 B200, GB200 and GB200 NVL72 at this year\u2019s GTC Conference. Recently, Barclays Tom O\u2019Malley gave an overweight rating on the stock, with a $145 price target due to its potential $25 billion opportunity from countries building up their AI capabilities. O\u2019Malley expects NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings at $3.62 per share in fiscal 2026, while Wall Street analysts on average have a $3.55 per share estimate for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings for 2026.\nThe largest shareholder in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is GQG Partners holding 133 million shares worth $12 billion whereas Coatue Management holds around 13 million shares in NVDA worth $1.2 billion\nAnswering to a question about whether a geopolitical risk concerning China invading Taiwan would affect NVIDIA or not, Philippe Laffont said, \"I think it would adversely affect NVIDIA, it would adversely affect the stock markets around the world, it would adversely affect everybody in this room. If this happens, we think this would be obviously a very significant event.\"\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares were our top contributor in the quarter following blowout 4Q results and 1Q guidance driven by strong data center sales. The company reported quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion, up 265% year-over-year, and EPS in the quarter of $5.16, up 487% year-over-year and 12% ahead of expectations. Revenue guidance for 1Q of $24 billion was 8% above very high expectations. The artificial intelligence arms race kicked-off by ChatGPT and Alphabet\u2019s Bard, among others, has generated tremendous demand for Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphic processors.\nOverall NVDA ranks 7th on our list of billionaire Phillipe Laffont's top stock picks.

Reports indicated Nvidia collaborating with Inspur, a key distribution partner in China, to introduce and distribute the new chip, tentatively named \"B20,\" which is part of Nvidia's \"Blackwell\" series.\nThe chip stocks also got a boost from China, which lowered key interest rates. China is a key AI chip market. However, it faces several economic challenges, including weak growth in the second quarter and looming deflation.\nOn Monday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced that it would cut the seven-day reverse repo rate to 1.7% from 1.8% and reduce the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.35% from 3.45%.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) closed at $122.45 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.89% move from the prior day. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.16%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.14%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.06%.\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had gained 4.6% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.47% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.96% in that time.\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Nvidia in its upcoming earnings disclosure. In that report, analysts expect Nvidia to post earnings of $0.63 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 133.33%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $28.24 billion, showing a 109.04% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\nNVDA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.69 per share and revenue of $117.75 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +106.92% and +93.29%, respectively.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Nvidia. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.48% higher within the past month. At present, Nvidia boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nIn terms of valuation, Nvidia is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 45.95. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 32.31 of its industry.\nIt is also worth noting that NVDA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.22. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Semiconductor - General industry stood at 2.65 at the close of the market yesterday.\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 216, finds itself in the bottom 15% echelons of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

        "Title": "Missed Out on Nvidia This Year? Here Are 2 Stocks That Could Make Up for That.",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Missing out on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has likely been a frustrating experience for many investors. Although most people have exposure to it indirectly through index funds, it's nothing compared to owning the stock directly.\nHowever, I've got two stocks with substantial upside potential that might be able to make up for some of the performance you've missed out on by not owning Nvidia directly.\nFirst is UiPath (NYSE: PATH). In a year when nearly any stock associated with artificial intelligence (AI) has gone up, UiPath hasn't had the same luxury. In fact, the stock is down about 50% this year although much of that decline is unjustified, in my opinion.\nUiPath makes robotic process automation (RPA) software. This allows its users to automate repetitive tasks and allows its clients to focus on projects that require original thinking. It also has various AI plug-ins that broaden the scope of what it can automate. While the RPA market is fairly young, Grand View Research expects this market to grow at nearly a 40% compound annual rate, reaching a global market size of more than $30 billion by 2030.\nIn the long term, UiPath's success will be fairly straightforward if it can maintain its market leadership position. However, it has been a bumpy 2024.\nUiPath's report for its fiscal 2025's first quarter (ended April 30) was packed with information, and not much was good. UiPath cut its full-year revenue outlook and also reverted to an unprofitable state. Its CEO also resigned, although he had only had the role for a few months. Replacing him is former CEO and founder Daniel Dines, so it's not a massive shakeup.\nAlthough the stock struggled heading into earnings, this was enough to send shares crashing over 30%.\nSo why can UiPath turn it around? First, its market opportunity is massive, and UiPath is a leader in the field. Second, having the founder-CEO return to the role brings some familiarity to the job. Lastly, UiPath is correcting its profitability slip by laying off around 10% of its workforce, something many companies did last year.\nUiPath is taking the right steps to bounce back, and the stock is also dirt cheap. At 5 times sales, the stock represents massive value, especially for a recently profitable company that is still expected to grow in the mid-double-digit range. While it may not be Nvidia, it does have the potential to double fairly easily with some good news.\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is often described as the Amazon of Latin America thanks to its dominant e-commerce platform and massive logistics network. However, it also has a thriving fintech wing, making it much more diverse.\nRegardless, MercadoLibre has been downright dominant in its market, with Q1 currency-neutral revenue growth of 94%. It's also improving its profit margins, which rose to 7.9% versus 6.3% last year.\nThis is just a continuation of MercadoLibre's decade-long success story. With the massive Latin American population it serves, there is far more growth ahead for MercadoLibre. Despite that, the stock trades far below where it was throughout most of the 2010s.\nWhile I'm not arguing that the stock should be worth more than 20 times sales, I do think the valuation could be higher due to its growth. Regardless, MercadoLibre has a massive growth runway, and investors shouldn't be surprised if its stock behaves like Amazon's over the long term: a massive market beater.\nIt's hard for a company growing incredibly fast while improving margins to underperform the market, which gives me confidence that MercadoLibre could be a stock that makes up for missing out on Nvidia over the next three to five years.\nBefore you buy stock in UiPath, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and UiPath wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Missed Out on Nvidia? Billionaires Are Buying These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Hand Over Fist.",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia created a staggering amount of value for investors over the last 18 months. It was a $360 billion company at the beginning of 2023, and today its market capitalization stands at a whopping $3.2 trillion. That's a ninefold increase, and it's only natural to feel disappointed if you missed the run.\nBut it's important to keep looking forward, and watching what Wall Street's top investors are doing can be one way to find the next big opportunity. In the first quarter of 2024, billionaire fund managers piled into two artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that weren't Nvidia:\nCitadel Advisors, which is run by billionaire Ken Griffin, bought 352,453 shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). It represented a 5.6% increase to the fund's total position in Amazon, which is now worth almost $1.3 billion.\nAppaloosa Management, which is run by billionaire David Tepper, bought 975,000 shares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). It represented a whopping 73% increase to the fund's original stake which it established at the end of 2023.\nBoth Amazon and Oracle have inserted themselves into the AI industry with a substantial amount of conviction. I'm not suggesting their respective stocks are about to stage an Nvidia-style rally, but here's why they could deliver strong returns for investors who buy them today.\nAmazon stock is up almost 30% this year, and the company was catapulted into the exclusive $2 trillion club just last month. Investors are bullish on the efficiency measures Amazon has adopted in its e-commerce segment to boost profits, but the company's growing presence in AI is also attracting lots of positive attention.\nAmazon uses AI across all of its businesses. AI powers the recommendation engine on amazon.com, which drives sales by showing customers products they are likely to buy. The Prime Video streaming platform also uses AI during the NFL's Thursday Night Football programming. It autonomously compiles highlights for the viewer on demand, shows them advanced stats like the running speed of each player, and gives the viewer data-driven insights into the next potential play.\nBut the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform is home to the company's heavy-hitting AI projects. AWS designed its own data center chips, which can train AI models at 50% of the cost of Nvidia's industry-leading GPUs. Plus, the Amazon Bedrock platform offers AWS customers a library of pre-built large language models (LLMs), which they can use to accelerate the development of their own AI applications.\nThe tech giant recently invested $4 billion in leading AI start-up Anthropic. As part of the deal, Anthropic agreed to make AWS its primary cloud platform, and it will train its future models using Amazon's chips. Plus, it agreed to make those models available on Bedrock so AWS customers can use them to build their own apps. This partnership could entice aspiring developers to choose AWS over competing clouds like Microsoft Azure.\nAmazon generates more revenue than every other company in the $2 trillion club, and yet it trades at the cheapest price-to-sales (P/S) valuation of the bunch. Plus, Wall Street thinks Amazon will deliver $4.18 in earnings per share this year, which would represent a whopping 44% growth compared to 2023.\nAWS remains the company's most profitable segment, but its e-commerce business is benefiting from improvements to its fulfillment network that are driving down its cost-to-serve metric (the cost of fulfilling orders). Considering e-commerce remains Amazon's largest source of revenue, those shrinking costs could lead to sustained long-term growth in the entire organization's profitability.\nAmazon stock might be trading near an all-time high right now, but I'm not surprised Citadel was a buyer recently because there could be plenty of upside in the tank.\nTech giants (including Amazon) are racing to build more data centers to meet the surging demand for computing capacity from AI developers. Oracle operates some of the best AI infrastructure in the industry, which is cheaper and faster than the competition.\nOracle's Supercluster technology allows developers to scale up to 32,768 of Nvidia's GPUs, and that will soon increase to 65,536. More GPUs can translate to bigger AI models, which leads to more advanced capabilities in finished AI applications like chatbots and virtual assistants. For context, some of Amazon's best AI infrastructure offers clusters of just 20,000 GPUs, and even Meta Platforms' latest data centers have clusters of around 24,000 GPUs.\nPlus, Oracle's unique random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology can move data between servers and devices much faster than traditional Ethernet networks. Since AI developers typically pay for computing capacity by the minute, faster processing can significantly drive down costs. Last year, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said the company's latest Gen2 infrastructure can train AI models at twice the speed and for half the cost of competing data centers.\nOracle is building new data centers right now to meet demand from leading developers like OpenAI, Cohere, and Elon Musk's xAI. In the recent fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended May 31), the company's remaining performance obligations (order backlog) surged 44% year over year to a record $98 billion. That included $12.5 billion in new AI deals from 30 different customers who are waiting for more capacity to come online.\nOracle's total revenue came in flat during Q4, but the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) segment brought in $2 billion, which represented 42% growth. Given the size of the order backlog I mentioned above, that figure looks poised for substantial growth in the coming years.\nOracle stock is up 39% this year and it's trading at a record high, yet it's still cheap. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 26, which is a 20% discount to the 32.7 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index.

        "Title": "Is Nvidia (NVDA) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think \"Yes\"",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nNvidia (NVDA) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 59.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 106.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -14.7%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 2.2%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Missed Out on Nvidia's Run-Up? My Best AI Stock to Buy and Hold.",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly been the hottest topic in the business world in the past year and a half. Executives are trying to better position their companies to take advantage of this trend. And the investment community is figuring out ways to profit from what many see as a revolutionary technology.\nThere's no denying that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the poster child of the AI boom. The company is firing on all cylinders. And the stock has gone bonkers, catapulting 2,500% higher in the past five years and 682% since the start of 2023.\nIf you missed Nvidia's monster rally, don't worry. Perhaps it's time to consider what I believe is the best AI stock to buy and hold.\nNvidia is known for selling graphics processing units that power AI applications. The company has a stranglehold on the market. It has a whopping 98% revenue share of the data center GPU industry. Nvidia essentially sells the picks and shovels that power AI systems that other businesses are investing aggressively in. This puts it in a favorable competitive position to benefit from the ongoing AI gold rush, which many observers think is still very much in the early innings.\nIt's not a surprise that growth has been tremendous. In fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), revenue was up 126% versus the prior year. And during the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), the good times continued, with sales rising 262%. It's also encouraging to see that Nvidia is extremely profitable, reporting an operating margin of 65% in Q1.\nNvidia's momentum is impressive, as the business benefits from heightened spending on AI-related infrastructure. However, investors shouldn't expect Nvidia's spectacular growth to continue indefinitely. That's an unrealistic assumption.\nWhile the company's success has been eye-popping, the valuation has gotten stretched. Shares trade at a nosebleed price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 67.3. It might be too late to buy the stock, as optimism has gotten sky-high.\nThe market always falls in love with a hot growth story. This has pushed Nvidia's market cap to $2.8 trillion. But investors shouldn't ignore a dominant internet firm that I believe is well positioned in the AI race. I'm talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG).\nThe tech titan has been utilizing AI and machine learning as far back as 2001 in its flagship service, Google Search. It's not new to this technology. In fact, CEO Sundar Pichai positioned the business to focus more on AI initiatives in 2016. While the introduction of ChatGPT might have spurred a race to develop AI products quickly, it's worth pointing out that Alphabet was ahead of the curve.\nThis puts Alphabet in a prime position because its products and services are used by billions of people worldwide every day. It doesn't necessarily need a killer AI app to drive financial gains. It can constantly launch new AI features to its user base to almost instant adoption, something only a select few other companies can do.\nAlphabet's Gemini AI models are \"making Google's own products better,\" Pichai said on the Q2 2024 earnings call. In the Google Cloud segment, AI will be a big focal point to better serve clients with their various needs, making Alphabet an even more important mission-critical partner.\nIt's hard to argue with the belief that Alphabet will be a leader in the AI race. Besides being a leading enterprise at the cutting edge of the internet and technology, it has unrivaled resources to invest heavily. As of June 30, the business had $101 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on the balance sheet, much more than the $13 billion in long-term debt. Plus, it has exceptional talent and tech know-how.\nAt a P/E ratio of 26.4 and with forecast earnings-per-share growth of 19.4% between 2023 and 2026, Alphabet is my best AI stock to buy and hold.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

Cramer said that many people in the financial industry are just \u201cafter your fees\u201d and they aren\u2019t interested in making money from original investing. Cramer said that hedge fund managers and mutual funds make investing look inaccessible and impenetrable.\nCramer said that he\u2019s \u201cpulling back the curtain\u201d and emphasized that investing isn\u2019t \u201crocket science\u201d or \u201cbrain surgery\u201d and you don\u2019t need to go to a business school to understand it. Cramer pitched himself as a \u201ccoach\u201d or a \u201ctranslator\u201d who can explain the meaning of complex financial terms to ordinary people.\n\u201cYou can comprehend all the mystical-sounding vocabulary we throw around here as long as you have a translator, a coach like me, who can explain what the darn words mean.\u201d\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\nJim Cramer in a latest program yet again repeated his thesis on NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), saying \u201cown it don\u2019t trade it.\u201d Cramer said when the second quarter of this year started, there was a \u201cwidely-held\u201d belief that the stock had \u201cmoved too much\u201d and it was time to do some selling.\n\u201cI heard that several times a day during our network.\u201d\nCramer said that despite its $3 trillion market cap, NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is \u201cunrivaled in its ability to usher in this new industrial revolution.\u201d\nCramer said that he\u2019s been lauding for NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0for over a decade.\nDan Ives is one of the biggest NVDA bulls on the Street. Recently, responding to Newstreet Research\u2019s downgrade of NVDA, Ives on Twitter wrote:\n\u201cWe cannot disagree more with this negative Nvidia call as discussed on\u00a0@LastCallCNBC\u00a0last night as the AI Revolution is just starting in our view being led by Nvidia and the Godfather of AI Jensen in this 9 pm party.\u201d\nThere is no shortage of Wall Street analysts calling NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) a top dog in the AI race. Recently, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight.\nNVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest product announcements and its plans revealed at the Computex 2024 show that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts like NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and think its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will start shipping H200 in the second half of this year. At its GTC conference NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed three accelerators \u2013 B200, GB200 and GB200 NVL72. All of these products provide growth catalysts for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares and justify its P/E multiple of 71, given NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth expectation of over 100% this year and 32% next year. Based on 2026 EPS estimate set by Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 35.74, which makes the stock\u2019s valuation attractive given the growth catalysts it has.\nL1 Capital International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cSimply not owning\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was a key contributor to the relative underperformance of the Fund against its Benchmark.

        "Title": "Why Did 1 Wall Street Analyst Just Downgrade Nvidia Stock?",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) remains sizzling hot. Its share price has skyrocketed over 150% so far this year following a gain of nearly 240% in 2023. The company's sales jumped 262% year over year in the first quarter.\nEverything seems to be going Nvidia's way. So why did one analyst just downgrade Nvidia stock?\nOn Friday, NewStreet Research analyst Pierre Ferragu did something rare these days: He downgraded Nvidia stock. Ferragu previously recommended the stock as a buy; he now maintains a neutral rating on the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker.\nFerragu's primary concern with Nvidia isn't surprising. He thinks the stock's valuation has reached a point where it simply doesn't have much room to run, writing last week, \"We see limited further upside based on what we hear from the value chain.\" Ferragu said that upside potential \"will only materialize in a bull case,\" and that he doesn't \"have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.\"\nNewStreet Research isn't the only party concerned about Nvidia's valuation. New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran, one of the most prominent stock valuation experts in the world, has an even more dire outlook. Damodaran believes Nvidia could be close to 50% overvalued after its remarkable run.\nDon't think Ferragu has become an Nvidia bear, though. His one-year price target for the stock is $135, slightly higher than the current share price. Ferragu's two-year price target for Nvidia is $143, reflecting an upside potential of roughly 9%.\nHe also remains optimistic about Nvidia's underlying business, stating, \"The quality of the franchise is nevertheless intact.\" Ferragu added, \"[W]e would be buyers again, but only on prolonged weakness.\"\nNewStreet Research's downgrade of Nvidia was quickly followed by good news from another analyst. On Monday, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised his 12-month price target to $150 from $120 and maintained a buy recommendation on the stock.\nArcuri's more optimistic outlook stems from his research on the demand for Nvidia's soon-to-be-released Blackwell platform. He wrote, \"Our recent supply chain checks confirm our prior suspicions that demand momentum for Blackwell rack-scale systems remains exceedingly robust.\" Arcuri now projects Nvidia will generate 2025 revenue of $204 billion, up 12% from his previous forecast.\nFerragu's cautious price target for Nvidia matches up pretty well with the broader Wall Street consensus. The average analysts' 12-month price target for the stock is $129.53, according to LSEG. On the other hand, 21 of the 38 analysts surveyed by LSEG in July rated Nvidia as a buy or strong buy, versus 15 who had a neutral rating on the stock. This is more in line with Arcuri's position.\nThe differing views on Wall Street stem from uncertainty about how strong Nvidia's growth will be going forward. Tremendous growth expectations are already baked into the share price. Ferragu's downgrade reflects this. However, the demand for Nvidia's new Blackwell chips fueled by generative AI could cause analysts to revise their growth projections -- something Arcuri seems to be banking on happening.\nWhich analyst is right about Nvidia? We'll have to wait and see. My hunch is that Nvidia could have more room to run than Ferragu predicts. But I agree with him 100% about the quality of the company's business and that the stock would be an excellent buy on a sustained pullback.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nThe Russian-founded tech giant Yandex has left Russia after finalizing one of the country\u2019s most significant foreign corporate exits since the Russo-Ukraine war started. Reuters reports that Russian investors acquired the last of Yandex\u2019s Russian assets, and the company has rebranded itself as the Dutch-based Nebius Group. The company is now working to triple its data center deployments of Nvidia chips.\nThe deal took around two years to complete and culminated in Russian investors paying $5.4 billion for the remaining 28% of Yandex NV (YNV) shares, which was still a bargain for the buyers. The Russian government demanded a discount of at least 50% on foreign asset sales.\nThe company claims its deployment in Finland is the most powerful commercially available supercomputer on the continent, but it plans to triple its footprint with new Nvidia GPUs to compete with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft in the AI sphere.\n\"It's in Nvidia's interest to diversify their client base; they're interested in growing guys like us,\" Volozh told the Financial Times. \"We've had a working relationship with them for years. They know and trust us,\" said the Yandex founder.\nIn 2022, the EU imposed restrictions on Yandex co-founder Arkady Volozh over his alleged complicity in the Ukrainian invasion. Volozh later condemned the conflict, calling it barbaric, and the EU lifted the ban. It paved the way for Volozh to become CEO of Yandex again, now Nebius Group, in its new incarnation. Rebuilding the company in Amsterdam, Volozh will lead a team of 1,300 employees, primarily former Yandex staff.\nThe Yandex brand will be phased out by July 31. YNV chairman John Boynton expressed gratitude to the company\u2019s employees, especially negotiations leader Vadim Marchuk. \u201cAll connections with Russia have now been severed,\u201d he told Reuters.\nNebius Group plans to operate in four AI-centric businesses: cloud computing, data labeling, autonomous driving, and education technology. Yandex once dominated these businesses in Russia, so the company knows them well. Nebius has already begun collaborating to develop its EU cloud computing platform.\nNebius Group hopes the Russian exit will allow its Nasdaq listing to start trading again. Trading the company\u2019s shares on the U.S.-based stock exchange has been suspended for over two years.\nEdit 7/21/2024 3:10pm PT: Yandex was not previously banned from procuring Nvidia GPUs.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential.\u00a0Since Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nKing Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management\u2019s chief strategist, recently talked to CNBC about the latest decline in tech stocks and market rotation. Lip said that he\u2019s still bullish on tech stocks and a single event does not show a trend. However, the cause of decline in tech stocks last week was the lower-than-expected CPI data which caused investors to do some \u201cprofit taking\u201d and invest in names that can benefit \u201cmore\u201d from lower interest rates, according to the analyst. Lip noted that small-cap stocks, real estate stocks, among others, gained ground on the back of this trend.\nHowever, Lip has high expectations from the upcoming earnings reports from tech companies. He also said that July has been one of the strongest months for tech stocks. Lip, however, said that major tech companies cannot go on to post record gains and their returns are expected to \u201cfall in line with historical returns.\u201d\nLip thinks the economy is entering a \u201cGoldilocks scenario\u201d where growth is steady but not \u201chot enough\u201d to cause inflation. He reiterated his view that he expects strong earnings growth this year and in 2025, which could be a tailwind for stocks.\nAsked what would cause earnings growth of tech companies, Lip said a lot of that comes down to efficient management and strong cash piles these companies have. He also said \u201cslightly\u201d lower interest rates could also be a tailwind for the economy.\nSince Lip is bullish on tech stocks and believes major AI companies still have upside potential, we decided to take a look at the top names in his portfolio. These are the top holdings of King Lip, according to CNBC. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\nNVDA is one of the top AI stock picks of King Lip.\nUBS also believes Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to benefit from the $331 billion market opportunity in the AI Enabling layer, thanks to its GPUs. In the Cloud segment of the Enabling layer, UBS thinks Nvidia Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) DGX offering makes the company a promising player. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) DGX Cloud is a supercomputing service that gives enterprises access to software and infrastructure required to train advanced models for generative AI. It\u2019s a combination of servers and workstations for optimizing deep learning applications through the use of general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU).\nOn the Intelligence and Application layer of the AI value chain, UBS sees no notable catalyst for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nNVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest product announcements and its plans revealed at the Computex 2024 show that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts like NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and think its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.\nL1 Capital International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cSimply not owning\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) was a key contributor to the relative underperformance of the Fund against its Benchmark. The Wall Street Journal even published a recent article with the title \u2018No Nvidia in Your Portfolio? You\u2019re Just Toast\u2019. While that is a little melodramatic, it is rare for one company to have such an outsized impact on index returns.\nOverall, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. While we acknowledge the potential of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia has been the artificial intelligence (AI) stock to own over the past year and a half. However, the expectations built into the stock are mind-boggling and could spell disaster in the future.\nYet AI is here to stay, and if you're looking to invest in this sector, I'd consider these stocks before considering Nvidia.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) makes many of the chips that go inside all the devices that power the incredible AI technology being used today. With Nvidia's GPUs being packed full of TSMC products, it's also benefiting from its performance.\nAnother huge customer is Apple,\u00a0which recently announced its AI offering was only available on the latest generation of phones. This could ignite a large refresh wave, benefiting Taiwan Semi immensely.\nRegardless, management projects AI-related revenue to grow at a 50% compound annual rate for the next five years, when it expects this segment to make up more than 20% of overall sales. Over the long term, management expects overall revenue growth of 15% to 20%, which would result in massive market outperformance.\nAlthough Taiwan Semi's stock has had an excellent run this year (it's up over 75%), I believe that run can continue for years to come as its products are integrated into a world that has barely scratched the surface of AI capabilities.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, which has long been a proponent of AI. While it appeared caught off guard by the surge in generative AI popularity in late 2022, its recent launches corrected that blunder and its Gemini model emerged as a top pick.\nAlphabet has also integrated AI into various advertising products, allowing advertisers to create effective campaigns and ensuring that its internal models match the proper ad with viewers. While these releases haven't directly translated into a massive revenue increase, they solidified Alphabet's top place among the locations that advertisers must spend with.\nWhile Alphabet won't be as flashy an investment as Nvidia, it will steadily outperform the market by a couple of percentage points each year thanks to its dividend, aggressive share repurchase plan, and steady growth.\nThe stock trades for around 25 times forward earnings, so it's not historically cheap, but it is substantially less pricey than many of its peers.\nSalesforce (NYSE: CRM) is a bit of a backdoor pick, as it's a customer relationship management software company. However, it is heavily pushing its AI model to its customers as a way to improve their businesses. It can be integrated internally to equip employees with the best information possible when completing a sale, thanks to heavy reliance on internal customer data. It can also create AI chatbots that provide better customer service interaction than has historically been available.\nWith Salesforce's market position, getting this AI offering right is key to maintaining its market dominance. It also provides another growth lever for the company, as its maturity is starting to show, with revenue only growing in the high single digits.\nHowever, it has recently initiated a dividend and still has a ways to go before achieving peak software company profit margins (the gold standard is Adobe's 30% margin).\nThis all adds up to plenty of growth ahead for the stock and it could be a long-term market beater.\nAll three companies are more steady than Nvidia, which has displayed a cyclical nature throughout its existence. Choosing Alphabet, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Salesforce is a smart idea if you're looking for more reasonably priced stocks with strong growth potential.\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The mega-hype surrounding Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) 10-for-1 stock split and its brief stint as the most valuable company on the market is in the past, but Nvidia still might be the most closely followed stock in the investing community today.\nHowever, since it has gained nearly 700% over the past two years, some investors are concerned about how much higher it can go in the near term. Several billionaires have been pocketing some of their gains and using them to fund other investments that might have more near-term fuel.\nSome examples are Israel Englander of Millennium Management, who sold 2,409,326 shares of Nvidia in the 2024 first quarter, or 64% of his fund's position; Ken Griffin of Citadel, who sold 883,563 shares, or 43% of his position; and John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma, who sold 451,464 shares, or 77% of their position.\nInstead, all four billionaire investors bought a different artificial intelligence (AI) stock: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Englander bought 2,476,287 shares, or 34% more; Griffin added 4,673,930 shares, a 246% increase; and Overdeck and Siegel added 364,950 shares to their position, a 41% increase.\nShould investors follow their lead?\nNvidia and Amazon are both deeply invested in the generative AI revolution, but they run very different businesses and even work together. Nvidia makes the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power generative AI, which is the main reason its stock has skyrocketed over the past two years, while Amazon is developing applications to make generative AI work.\nAmazon has rolled out a competitive set of generative AI applications that help developers create powerful tools to make businesses run better. These are directed at Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients. This is Amazon's cloud computing segment, and it's the leading global provider of cloud services.\nSome tools include chatbots and virtual assistants that can take some of the load away from human customer-service agents, freeing up resources and leading to higher efficiency; code prompts for developers, who can use more time for creative processes instead of manual coding; and high-level data analytics that can help companies make faster, more accurate decisions.\nOf the many companies that are already using these tools, one example Amazon highlighted is DoorDash, which used AWS generative AI tools to build a self-service contact center for its delivery personnel.\nThis is an incredible opportunity for several reasons. As the largest cloud computing company in the world, Amazon stands to benefit from clients moving over to these tools, and it can also attract new clients to maintain and grow its lead. According to management, company spending on cloud tools is still a small percentage of total information-technology expense, leaving a wide gap that's ripe for the taking.\nAWS is already on the upswing again after facing inflationary pressure. Sales increased 17% year over year in the 2024 first quarter, and management says trends are stabilizing after clients went through some cost-optimization.\nAmazon uses AI throughout its operations, which it has been doing since well before AI became an investor buzzword.\nMachine learning and data analytics are at the root of Amazon's e-commerce business. They offer recommendations for customers looking for a specific product, along with instant comparisons between similar products to help customers choose and convert higher sales. It also uses these kinds of tools in its vast delivery network to make instant calculations about the fastest and cheapest routes to get an order fulfilled.\nThe company is using the same infrastructure to build up its advertising business. There might not be any better platform for Amazon's third-party vendors to advertise their products than on its site, where hundreds of millions of Prime members and other shoppers are already looking for their products.\nThe company can send the right ads to the right shoppers with unmatched accuracy, increasing sales for vendors and Amazon, and increasing the success of its ad business.\nNvidia is still an excellent company with strong long-term growth drivers, but investors are worried that with a high valuation and increasing competition, it could have some of its growth priced in. Nvidia stock is already down slightly from its recent jump that resulted from its split.\nAmazon stock, on the other hand, is demonstrating strong and steady growth. It's up 32% this year but only 9% over the past three years -- in other words, it only recently surpassed its previous high, so you can still get in while it's climbing. The company has massive long-term opportunities, and investors can feel confident following billionaire investors into a position, or increasing a position, in Amazon stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

The 82% EPS beats percentage for this group of 61 index members compares to 77% in 2024 Q1, 80.3% in 2023 Q4 and the average for the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) of 79.6%. \nThe 55.7% revenue beats percentage for this group of companies compares to 63.9% in the preceding period and 20-quarter low of 60.7%. \nIn other words, companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus revenue estimates at this stage in the Q2 reporting cycle. \nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 61 companies with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are on track to be up +8.8% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues. \nFor a more detailed look at the Q2 earnings season and evolving expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>Q2 Earnings Season Starts Positively\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+157.4% vs. +115.3%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.\u00a0The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\u00a0Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+48.5% vs. +14.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific.

Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram.\u00a0Threads have more than 175 million monthly actives.

        "Title": "Institutional owners may ignore NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) recent US$258b market cap decline as longer-term profits stay in the green",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Significantly high institutional ownership implies NVIDIA's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\n44% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders\n Insiders have been selling lately \nEvery investor in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 66% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nNo shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 8.5% in value last week. Still, the 142% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about NVIDIA.\n View our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nWe can see that NVIDIA does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of NVIDIA, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NVIDIA. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.7% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.4% of common stock, and FMR LLC holds about 4.4% of the company stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang directly holds 3.5% of the total shares outstanding.\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nWe can see that insiders own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$109b. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. \nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 30% stake in NVIDIA. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  NVIDIA is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The analysts maintained their \"overweight\" rating for the stock.\nKeyBanc analyst John Vinh reported that demand for Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell platform is even better than previously expected.\n\"The interest and demand in GB200 is greater than we initially had sized,\u201d the analyst wrote, adding that the Blackwell demand \"should support data center revenues of over $200B in 2025.\"\nUBS analysts, alongside Wolfe Research, also reported robust demand for Blackwell supported by big tech's AI spending.\nAmid some concerns about whether Nvidia could face an \"air pocket\" in sales if some customers opt to wait for Nvidia's latest tech instead of buying Hopper, Blackwell's predecessor, KeyBanc analysts said demand for Hopper remains strong.\n\"Despite the impending launch of Blackwell in 2H24, we are not seeing any signs of a demand pause as demand for H100 remains robust, as we continue to see rush orders,\" the analysts said, in what could be a promising sign for Nvidia's older products as the chipmaker rolls out new technology.\nNvidia plans for its next-generation AI platform Rubin to follow Blackwell, as part of its one-year product cycle to keep up with the evolution of AI technology.\nRead the original article on Investopedia.\n"

        "Title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying 2 Turbocharged Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia has been one of hottest stocks on Wall Street for the better part of two years. But professional money managers have become increasingly cautious about holding large positions in the chipmaker as shares have skyrocketed. Compared to its weight in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), Nvidia was the second-most under-owned big tech stock across institutional portfolios in the first quarter, according to Morgan Stanley.\nThe hedge fund billionaires below contributed to that trend by selling shares of Nvidia and buying shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) or ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) during the quarter.\nLouis Bacon of Moore Capital Management sold 2,006 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 19%. He also started a position in Alphabet, which ranks among his top 20 non-option holdings.\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management sold 720,004 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 35%. He also increased his position in ServiceNow by 728%, such that it ranks among his top non-option 30 holdings.\nDavid Shaw of D.E. Shaw sold 1.4 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 38%. He also increased his position in ServiceNow by 17%, such that it ranks among his top 60 non-option holdings.\nPaul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment sold 103,337 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 78%. He also increased his position in Alphabet by 347%, such that it ranks among his top 30 non-option holdings.\nImportantly, every billionaire mentioned above still has exposure to Nvidia, so investors should not interpret their trades to mean Nvidia is a bad investment. However, Alphabet and ServiceNow produced turbocharged returns of 174% and 179%, respectively, over the last five years. So both stocks warrant further consideration.\nAlphabet has two major growth engines. It is the largest digital advertising company and the third-largest cloud infrastructure provider as measured by sales. Its Google subsidiary is widely recognized as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) research, and the company is bringing that expertise to bear across both business segments. New generative AI tools help advertisers create campaigns and optimize profits, and its Gemini family of models simplifies software development, data analytics, and threat detection. The Gemini models can also be fine-tuned to create custom generative AI applications.\nAlphabet reported solid financial results in the second quarter, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 14% to $84.7 billion on steady sales growth in the advertising segment and accelerating sales growth in cloud services. Meanwhile, GAAP net income jumped 31% to $1.89 per diluted share as the company continued to prioritize disciplined cost control.\nCEO Sundar Pichai said, \"Year to date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers.\" All things considered, there was very little to dislike about the quarter. Yet, shares declined following the report, perhaps because YouTube advertising revenue missed estimates, or else because management warned that AI infrastructure investments would be a near-term headwind to margins.\nEither way, the drawdown creates a reasonable buying opportunity for patient investors. Digital ad spending is projected to increase at 8% annually through 2027, according to eMarketer. And cloud services spending is forecasted to increase at 21% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. Those tailwinds give Alphabet a good shot at double-digit revenue growth through the end of the decade, and earnings should grow slightly faster as margins continue to expand.\nWall Street analysts expect earnings to grow at 16% annually through 2026. That estimate leaves room for upside, but the current valuation of 24.3 times earnings is reasonable even if Wall Street's consensus estimate is correct. The stock is still down 6% since the second-quarter report, so patient investors should capitalize by purchasing a small position today.\nServiceNow provides a broad range of workflow management software. The company is best known for its leadership in the IT service management (ITSM) and AI for IT operations markets, but its platform also includes solutions for customer service management, human resources service delivery, and robotic process automation. ServiceNow began adding AI capabilities to its platform years ago, such as conversational chatbots, intelligent document processing, and predictive analytics. The company more recently debuted a set of generative AI capabilities called Now Assist.\nServiceNow reported strong financial results in the second quarter, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 22% to $2.5 billion and non-GAAP net income jumped 32% to $3.13 per diluted share. The company maintained its renewal rate of 98%, and remaining performance obligation rose 32%, hinting at strong revenue growth in the coming quarters.\nImportantly, management attributed its performance to broad-based demand across its software portfolio: 14 of the 20 largest deals involved at least eight products, and Now Assist became the fastest-growing new product in company history. But CFO Gina Mastantuono said ServiceNow has only scratched the surface of its tremendous opportunity in generative AI.\nGoing forward, the ITSM market is expected to grow at 9% annually through 2030. ServiceNow should grow more quickly due to its market leadership in IT software, opportunities in adjacent software markets, and its expanding suite of generative AI tools. Accordingly, Wall Street expects adjusted earnings to grow at 21% annually through 2026.\nUnfortunately, that estimate makes the current valuation of 63.5 times adjusted earnings look expensive. ServiceNow is an wonderful company, but I plan to keep this stock on my watchlist for the time being. Personally, I would feel more comfortable buying shares if the price-to-earnings ratio was closer to 40.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stole the show in the first half of the year, soaring about 150% and reporting triple-digit gains in earnings. The company garnered even more attention when it announced and then completed a 10-for-1 stock split, a move to bring its stock price down from more than $1,000. Nvidia still makes a great buy today as this company dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market -- and demand in this high-growth market could continue to climb for quite some time.\nBut today two other players make better bargain buys than Nvidia. These stocks are less expensive than the leading chip designer, and they also stand to gain from demand for AI products and services in the coming months and years. So now is a great time to get in on these companies and potentially benefit as their earnings take off.\nIntel (NASDAQ: INTC) didn't start off with a bang in the AI race. The company is a longtime leader in the central processing unit market -- these are the main processors in any given computer -- but fell behind when it comes to powering AI platforms.\nThe company has reached a key turning point in recent times, though, putting a big focus on AI and even launching a new portfolio of AI products. These include the Intel Core Ultra mobile processor family to support the AI personal computer, or a high-powered PC that can handle AI tasks. And Intel has launched the Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, a chip that's delivered 50% better inference and 40% better power efficiency than Nvidia's top-selling H100.\nIntel's Gaudi 3 is considerably cheaper than the Nvidia product, offering Intel the opportunity to carve out market share among cost-conscious customers.\nOn top of this, Intel also recently opened its chip manufacturing network to others -- and aims to become the world's second-biggest foundry by 2030. This won't result in immediate gains to earnings, but if Intel is successful, over time this could become a major revenue driver.\nToday, Intel shares trade for 28 times forward earnings estimates, while Nvidia stock trades for 47. It's true that Nvidia's earnings growth story has been far more compelling than that of Intel in recent quarters, but Intel may be on the verge of turning things around. Even if the company never reaches the level of Nvidia when it comes to serving the AI market, Intel still could become highly successful -- and the stock may take off as this story unfolds.\nOracle (NYSE: ORCL) may be far behind leader Amazon when it comes to cloud market share -- Amazon Web Services is the world's biggest cloud services provider -- but Oracle is growing fast. Proof of this is in the third quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, Oracle's total cloud revenue surpassed the company's license support revenue for the first time ever.\nAI customers have flocked to Oracle's variety of cloud services, from public cloud to sovereign cloud, and even Oracle Alloy -- which allows partners to become cloud providers. Customers also like Oracle's multi-cloud services, allowing them to easily deploy projects across Oracle and other providers such as Microsoft. And Oracle also offers its services at lower prices than its rivals, an element that clearly could appeal to customers.\nAll of this has translated into accelerating demand and revenue growth, as we can see by looking at the company's most recent earnings reports. Over the past two quarters, Oracle has signed its largest sales contracts ever, with customers aiming to train large language models in the Oracle cloud. This helped remaining performance obligations (RPO), or future revenue the company expects from contracts, to climb 44% to $98 billion. And the company expects this trend to push revenue growth into the double digits for the full year.\nThe company also has said in recent times that demand for its Gen2 AI infrastructure is surpassing supply even as the company expands its data centers.\nMeanwhile, Oracle stock trades for only 23 times forward earnings estimates, dirt cheap considering AI demand and the company's revenue momentum. And that makes Oracle a top bargain AI stock to buy now and hold onto as its exciting growth story picks up speed.\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The first half of 2024 has been a strong one for the stock market, and the clear leader driving that growth has been Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock of the chipmaker has been on a meteoric rise over the past five years and that momentum continued into the first half of 2024 with the stock up over 150%.\nWith the first half of the year now behind us, though, it is time to look for a stock that can potentially help power the market higher in the second half. One candidate is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\u00a0(NASDAQ: GOOG).\nThe biggest trend in the market in the first half of 2024 was clearly artificial intelligence (AI). Not long ago considered a nascent technology, AI certainly hit the mainstream early this year with numerous tech companies beginning to offer AI-powered features in their products.\nThe biggest early beneficiary of this technological shift has been Nvidia, whose graphic processing units (GPUs) are used to build out the infrastructure needed to run AI training and inference. With AI taking off and companies rushing to introduce AI solutions, demand for Nvidia chips has outstripped supply as the company has worked with its manufacturing partners to expand production capacity quickly.\nThis has led to explosive growth from the company to start the year, with its first-quarter revenue soaring 262% to $26 billion.\nAI infrastructure was the dominant theme in the first half of the year. But it may be Nvidia's cloud computing customers that help lead the market higher in the second half. The three large cloud computer companies of Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have all benefited from the rise of AI thus far, but they still have a lot more potential growth coming down the road.\nOf the three companies, the one I like the most is Alphabet for a few reasons.\nThe first reason is that with the smallest cloud segment of the three, it has some of the best earnings growth potential. The cloud computing business has a lot of high fixed costs associated with it, so companies need to reach a certain level of scale before they become profitable. However, once they do, the operating leverage of the business model starts to kick in and profitability growth will outpace revenue growth.\nGoogle Cloud just recently hit this scale and turned profitable last year. As such, the segment should see strong profitability growth in both the second half of this year as well as in future years.\nSecond, while there have been some kinks with the company introducing new AI overlays with its search results, there is some solid potential for the company in this area. Alphabet traditionally only served up link-based ads on about 20% of its search results and only gets paid when those links get clicks. However, the company is already testing new ad formats both with its AI overlays and well as new AI-powered formats for retailers. With 80% of its search results previously not monetized, this offers a huge potential upside in the years ahead.\nMeanwhile, Alphabet is also the cheapest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 25. Given this, in addition to its growth prospects, the stock also has the potential to expand its multiples (which is simply when its P/E ratio and other valuation metrics move higher). That sets the stock up for a strong potential performance in the back half of this year.\nWhile I still wouldn't count out Nvidia as leading the market once again in the second half of the year just given how much momentum it is seeing in its business, I think Alphabet is a strong candidate to lead the market forward the rest of this year.\nLuckily for investors, you don't have to choose just one and can own both Nvidia and Alphabet. Both continue to have bright long-term futures.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia's reportedly scaling back RTX 40 series production by as much as 50% in preparation for the Blackwell RTX 50 launch",
        "Author": "  Nick Evanson ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nOne of Taiwan's leading financial news media, UDN, is claiming that Nvidia is heavily reducing the production of its high-end RTX 40-series graphics chips in preparation for the launch of the Blackwell-powered RTX 50 range. However, the reduction is claimed to be so large, by as much as 50%, that prices for RTX 4070, 4080, and 4090 graphics cards will almost certainly increase.\nDesigning and developing new GPUs costs billions of dollars, so when a new generation of processors is only a few months away, companies like Nvidia will ease off on producing last-gen products, to ensure retailers' inventories aren't full of cheap, old stock. It's been that way for as long as there have been PC graphics cards, so the report from Taiwan's UDN (via TweakTown) claiming that high-end RTX 40 series GPU production is being scaled back isn't exactly headline news.\nHowever, in this instance, UDN is claiming that the reduction of AD102, AD103, and AD104 chip manufacturing could be 30% or as high as 50%. If it's the latter, it will have a notable impact on RTX graphics cards currently in stock.\nWhile the RTX 4070 and RTX 4080 didn't sell very well at launch in April 2023 and November 2022 respectively, Nvidia has shifted a fair number of them of late. That's partly because high-end GPUs, even ones designed just for gaming, are being snapped up to power small-scale AI servers.\nThe RTX 4070's price reduction, with the appearance of the RTX 4070 Super, and the RTX 4080 getting replaced entirely by the cheaper 4080 Super also helped sales.\nThis is why it's still relatively hard to find either card below their MSRPs, though you can find some GPU deals if you know where to search. So with demand still high, a reduction in availability will only lead to one thing and that's prices getting bumped up by third-party vendors.\nThe big drop in production is almost certainly indicative of Nvidia getting ready to announce the Blackwell-powered RTX 50 series, probably in September as it usually does, with the new products reaching shelves in late October, early November.\nBut if the current RTX 40 series ends up being hit with quite a big price rise, PC gaming enthusiasts are probably going to hold off on buying a new Nvidia card until the RTX 50s are available. If that happens, then all that old stock isn't going to be cleared enough and retailers are going to be stuck trying to sell pricey last-gen models at the same time as pricey new-gen cards.\nYour next upgrade\nBest CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD. Best gaming motherboard: The right boards. Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits. Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest.\nHopefully, some common sense gets applied all around. RTX 5070 models probably won't appear until January 2025 so there's no major call for the current RTX 4070 lineup to be heavily scaled back. If the production decrease is kept under a drop of 30%, it perhaps won't result in a big price hike or any price increase at all.\nAll this assumes, of course, that AMD and Intel don't steal some of Nvidia's thunder by launching their next-gen RDNA 4 and Battlemage GPUs toward the end of this year. If they do and their prices are very competitive, then Nvidia may be forced to lower the RTX 40 prices to maintain its market share.\nI know this is all ifs, mights, and maybes\u2014UDN is a reliable source for such information but the range in the manufacturing reduction is pretty big\u2014but you can be sure of one thing, at least. Nvidia's RTX graphics cards aren't suddenly going to become a whole lot cheaper. Let's just hope they don't suddenly go the other way.\n"

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If you're thinking about buying shares of Nvidia now, one issue you might be finding it hard to get around is its valuation. While the chipmaker's growth prospects are undoubtedly amazing, is the stock really worth paying more than 70 times earnings for? For many investors, the answer has been a resounding yes -- the chipmaker's market cap is up by around 150% this year to $3 trillion.\nBut if you're worried that Nvidia's high valuation could limit its returns in the future, then you might want to consider other stocks involved with artificial intelligence (AI) that could have more upside. One worth considering is Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA).\nAlibaba is a tech giant in China, but it has promising growth opportunities in other markets as well. And it's taking a page out of the handbooks of some of its e-commerce peers with its efforts to use AI to make it easier for sellers on its platform to reach customers in other countries. \nWith the help of AI, merchants can overcome foreign language barriers, sort out disputes with customers, and easily create descriptions for products. This is similar to how Shopify uses AI tools to make it easier for merchants on its platform to reach more customers. Alibaba, however, has the advantage of having its own large language model, Tongyi Qianwen, so it could potentially offer more customized and enhanced assistance. \nZhang Kaifu, Alibaba's head of AI development in its international e-commerce business, said that in internal tests, AI tools helped merchants achieve order growth up to 30%. \nThe international commerce segment remains a fairly small slice of Alibaba's overall business, and it could have a lot more room for growth. \nDuring the first three months of 2024, Alibaba reported $3.8 billion in revenue from its international commerce segment -- 12% of its $30.7 billion top line. But what was encouraging is that with 45% year-over-year growth, it was its fastest-growing business unit. Chinese commerce revenue was still the company's largest segment, with revenue from Taobao and Tmall bringing in $12.9 billion in sales in that quarter.\nBy focusing on international growth in a modestly sized area of its operations, Alibaba can position itself for much greater opportunities for expansion in the future, especially as it leverages AI to help with that growth.\nChinese stocks struggled in recent years due to a myriad of issues, including concerns about Chinese government interference with its domestic companies, and tensions between the U.S. and China. In the past three years, Alibaba's stock fell by 64%, largely due to those concerns.\nInvestors are discounting the stock severely for risks that may be overblown. China is a huge market and Alibaba is a big name there, with cloud, e-commerce, and digital media business units that give it great diversification. And at a time when many tech stocks are trading at lofty earnings multiples, Alibaba looks incredibly cheap, even based on its own historic levels.\nBABA PE Ratio data by YCharts.\nOver the past decade, its average P/E ratio was around 36, and over the past five years, it has had an average P/E of around 30. It's well below both of those levels now. The counterargument would be that Alibaba's growth has been slowing down, so it's not worth such a premium anymore. But in its last reported quarter, its sales expanded at a rate of 7%, and if AI proves to be a catalyst for its international e-commerce business, its growth rate may improve. \nWhile investors may still be putting a discount on the stock because it's a China-based company, I don't think the stock warrants this much of a discount.\nAlibaba is an underrated AI stock to buy right now. Its growth rate isn't terribly impressive, but there's still loads of potential here for the business in the long run. While some have been concerned that the Chinese government will take actions that inhibit the company's growth, so far, those moves haven't materialized, and concerns that Beijing will hinder it appear to be overblown. \nInvestors who are willing to look past the uncertainty and take a chance on what looks to be an incredibly cheap stock right now could be rewarded with some strong gains in the long run.\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been volatile lately. Following recent sell-offs driven by geopolitical risk factors and some disappointing earnings reports from other big tech companies, Nvidia stock has fallen more than 16% from its high.\nBut recent coverage published by Loop Capital suggests that Nvidia could be poised for a rebound and rally over the next year. In a note published July 22, the firm's lead analyst on the stock, Ananda Baruah, reiterated a buy rating on the artificial intelligence (AI) leader. Baruah also raised his one-year price target on the stock from $120 per share to $175 per share. With the stock priced at $114.25 per share as of this writing, the new target would suggest an upside of 54% over the next 12 months.\nIn Loop Capital's recent write-up on Nvidia, Baruah said that he thinks Nvidia has the potential to significantly outperform Wall Street's expectations. In particular, the analyst thinks that the company's data center segment could deliver revenue of between $215 billion and $240 billion -- far ahead of the average analyst estimate's call for sales of $145 billion. Baruah also thinks that the AI leader's compute segment can deliver sales of between $200 billion and $225 billion -- ahead of the average Wall Street target's call for sales of $132 billion.\nWith the incredible speed at which the business is expanding, Nvidia stock could still be cheap despite also having a growth-dependent valuation. Last quarter, Nvidia's revenue surged 262% year over year to hit $26 billion -- and earnings per share soared 629% compared to the prior-year period.\nWhile it remains to be seen how long the stellar growth momentum will continue, Nvidia looks poised for strong demand through the remainder of the year and should continue to post very impressive margins. For long-term investors looking to back leaders in the AI revolution, the recent stock pullback could be a buying opportunity.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "3 Unstoppable Stocks That Could Join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in the $3 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights ",
        "Text": "The U.S. Senate is sometimes called \"the most exclusive club.\" However, I can think of a club that's much more exclusive than the legislative body, which has 100 members. It's the $3 trillion club.\nOnly three companies in the world boast market caps of $3 trillion or more: Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. But this club might be a little less exclusive in the not-too-distant future. Here are three unstoppable stocks that could join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in the $3 trillion club.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is in the driver's seat to become the next $3 trillion company. The Google parent's market cap currently stands at around $2.3 trillion. At the rate the stock is climbing, it's not out of the question that Alphabet could join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia by early 2025.\nMost of Alphabet's revenue and profits continue to be generated by its Google Search business. While some have predicted the rise of generative AI presents an existential threat to search engines, Google has thrived. CEO Sundar Pichai noted in Alphabet's first-quarter earnings call that Google's new AI overviews have increased search usage and user satisfaction with search results.\nGoogle Cloud should enjoy a strong tailwind from AI for years to come. The unit's sales jumped 28% year over year in Q1 with operating income soaring 371%. Google Cloud is especially popular with generative AI start-ups, with more than 60% using its cloud service.\nYouTube is another key growth driver for the company. It's the leader in U.S. streaming with viewers watching over 1 billion hours of content daily. YouTube now has over 100 million music and premium service subscribers, while YouTube TV claims over 8 million paid subscribers.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't too far behind Alphabet, with a market cap hovering around $2 trillion. I fully expect the e-commerce and cloud services giant will also take a spot in the $3 trillion club within the next two or three years.\nLike Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS) should deliver strong growth in the years ahead thanks to the demand for building and deploying AI models. AWS is the leader in the cloud services market. I suspect it will stay on top because of the appeal of new products such as AI-powered software development assistant Q.\nAmazon dominates the e-commerce market. Cost improvements in the company's e-commerce platform and distribution network have helped to boost profitability. As Amazon increases delivery speed further, its e-commerce revenue and profits should grow as customers shop online more frequently.\nAdvertising is also an important growth engine for Amazon. In Q1, advertising sales soared 24% year over year on a constant-currency basis. This growth could increase in the future as advertising on Prime Video gains momentum.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has a steeper hill to climb to join the $3 trillion club. The social media leader's market cap of $1.3 trillion is well below the market caps of Alphabet and Amazon. However, I think it's only a matter of time before Meta reaches the $3 trillion threshold.\nThe company is an advertising juggernaut. Its apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, reach more than 3.2 billion people across the world every day. Advertisers can' ignore such a massive audience.\nMeta's efforts to more efficiently monetize its products, especially Reels, are paying off handsomely. Profits more than doubled year over year in Q1. The company continues to get better and better at showing ads to the right person at the right time.\nAI presents a major growth opportunity for Meta. In particular, CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that AI-powered business messaging will be the \"next major pillar\" of the company's business.\nYou might think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are no-brainer stocks to buy if they're truly on track to join the $3 trillion club. And you'd be right, in my view.\nAll three stocks have tremendous growth prospects. The growth drivers already mentioned don't even tell the full story. For example, robotaxis could be huge opportunities for Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox units. Meta could be a bigger winner in virtual reality and the metaverse. I think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are great stocks to buy and hold.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you\u2019d have $21,904!*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $43,562!*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $349,245!*\nRight now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee 3 \u201cDouble Down\u201d stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of July 8, 2024\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller is widely considered one of the greatest investors in American history. He made a name for himself in 1992 when he earned $1 billion betting against the British pound. Druckenmiller also ran Duquesne Capital Management between 1980 and 2010, a hedge fund that returned 30% annually over three decades without a single down year.\nWhile Druckenmiller no longer manages money for clients, he does manage his own fortune through Duquesne Family Office, so investors can still follow his portfolio. Druckenmiller made the following trades during the first quarter.\nSold 441,551 shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), reducing his position by 71%. Nvidia is still his seventh-largest position, accounting for 3.6% of his portfolio.\nBought 26,150 shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), increasing his position by 2%. Microsoft is his second-largest position and accounts for 11% of his portfolio.\nBought 194,067 shares of Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET), increasing his position by 83%. Arista is his 12th-largest position and accounts for 2.8% of his portfolio.\nInvestors should not interpret Druckenmiller's trades to mean Nvidia is a bad investment. The chipmaker still ranks among his largest holdings, but he did trim the position while adding to Microsoft and Arista. Here's what investors should know about those companies.\nMicrosoft reported strong financial results in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended April 2024), beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 17% to $61.9 billion, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income jumped 20% to $2.94 per diluted share. Microsoft is a multifaceted business with products ranging from IT solutions to video games, but strength in enterprise software and cloud computing were driving forces behind its third-quarter results.\nDuring the quarter, Microsoft continued leaning into artificial intelligence (AI) product development. The company introduced two copilots for its enterprise resource planning platform, Dynamics 365. Copilot for Service and Copilot for Sales improve customer service and sales agent productivity by drafting emails, summarizing information, and surfacing insights.\nThose products join a growing portfolio of generative AI tools that augment core applications across the Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 platforms. Copilots are still in the early stages of monetization, but CEO Satya Nadella told analysts nearly 60% of Fortune 500 companies use at least one copilot product, and UBS analysts estimate the total addressable market at over $400 billion.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft continued to take share in cloud computing due to its strength in data analytics and AI products like Azure OpenAI Service. More than 65% of Fortune 500 companies use Azure OpenAI Service, which lets developers fine-tune large language models from OpenAI (such as the models that power ChatGPT) and build generative AI applications. In total, Microsoft accounted for 25% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending during the quarter, up from 23% in the prior year.\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Microsoft to grow earnings at 14% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 36.8 times earnings look expensive, especially when the three-year average is 32.6 times. Personally, I would feel more comfortable buying Microsoft closer to 28 times earnings (i.e., two times the forecasted earnings growth rate), so I would keep the stock on my watchlist for now.\nNetworking specialist Arista reported encouraging financial results in the first quarter, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 16% to $1.6 billion, and GAAP net income surged 44% to $1.99 per diluted share. Investors have good reason to believe that momentum will continue.\nArista provides switching and routing platforms that move information through enterprise and cloud data centers. The company also provides adjacent software for network telemetry, workflow automation, and security. Morgan Stanley sees Arista as the company best positioned to monetize AI networking, a market estimated to reach $25 billion by 2027.\nArista views its core innovation as the Extensible Operating System (EOS), the software that runs across all its switching and routing platforms. That single-system approach differentiates Arista from legacy vendors, like Cisco Systems, that use multiple operating systems, a strategy that increases the cost and complexity of network maintenance.\nArista has gained substantial market share in the broader data center switching space over the last decade. Since 2014, its market share has increased 22 percentage points to 30%, while Cisco's has declined 35 percentage points to 34%. More importantly, Arista is the market leader in high-speed data center switches (100G to 400G) -- with more than double the market share of Cisco -- and high-speed switches are crucial to AI workloads.\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Arista to grow earnings per share at 19% annually over the next three to five years. In that context, its current valuation of 44.5 times earnings lands somewhere between reasonable and expensive. Personally, I would wait for a cheaper valuation before adding to my current position in Arista, but non-shareholders looking to diversify their AI exposure can consider buying a small position today.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are having a dramatic impact on the technology landscape, which is evident in the market value of some of the world's most technologically advanced businesses. What many of these companies have in common is that they're trailblazers in AI.\nApple is currently the leader (as of this writing), with Microsoft currently at No. 2, with market caps of $3.4 trillion and $3.3 trillion, respectively. Nvidia's ascent has been breathtaking, adding nearly $2 trillion in value over the past year and climbing to $2.9 trillion to take the No. 3 spot. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- all at the forefront of the AI revolution -- boast market caps of $2.2 trillion, $1.9 trillion, and $1.2 trillion, respectively.\nWith a market cap of just $387 billion, it might seem like a longshot to suggest that Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) might be in the running for membership in the $1 trillion club. However, an examination of the company's recent results and commentary from management suggests the adoption of generative AI could push the company to new heights over the next few years.\nOracle is in an enviable place in the AI revolution. It offers cloud, database, and enterprise-software solutions that are relied upon by 98% of the global Fortune 500 companies. Oracle's information technology (IT) expertise makes it one of the go-to sources for enterprises looking to adopt generative AI solutions.\nThis has helped fuel solid overall growth. During Oracle's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended May 31), revenue of $14.3 billion grew 3% year over year, while operating income jumped 15% -- but that doesn't tell the whole story.\nDuring the Q4 earnings call, Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison noted that the company had inked more than 30 AI-centric contracts worth more than $12 billion in the most recent quarter alone. This included some of the largest contracts in Oracle's history. Ellison said he expects robust demand for generative AI to \"turbocharge\" the company's cloud database growth.\nThis, in turn, pushed the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contracts not yet recognized as revenue -- to $98 billion, up 44% year over year. When RPO is growing faster than revenue, this suggests sales growth is accelerating. This helps to illustrate that Oracle is capitalizing on the growing demand for AI among its sizable customer base.\nOracle's long track record of cloud and AI experience has many new and existing enterprise clients jumping on the generative AI bandwagon, looking to benefit from the increased productivity resulting from AI adoption. That said, fortune favors the patient, as this process will take some time to come to fruition.\nAccording to Wall Street, Oracle is expected to generate revenue of $57.9 billion in its fiscal 2025 (which began June 1), giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 7. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Oracle would need to grow its revenue to approximately $148 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nRevenue grew by 11% year over year in the most recent quarter and is expected to accelerate to 15% for the fiscal year. If the company achieves 11% sales growth, Oracle could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2034. However, if the company can maintain a growth rate of 15%, it would knock a couple of years off that timeline, reaching a $1 trillion market cap by 2032.\nThat said, estimates regarding the impact of generative AI adoption continue to ratchet higher. Conservative estimates suggest the market could grow to between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\nIf Oracle continues to successfully tap into this AI opportunity and proceeds along its current growth trajectory, the company could achieve a $1 trillion market cap sooner than many expect.\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 1, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Super Micro Computer SMCI and Broadcom AVGO.\nLarge-cap technology stocks, particularly those associated with the AI trade, have faced considerable pressure over the last week or so, perhaps raising the eyebrows of many investors.\nMore specifically, beloved Nvidia, Super Micro Computer and Broadcom have all seen their shares dive, as we can see illustrated in the chart below that tracks performance from last Friday, June 21.\nThe price action raises a valid question \u2013 is this a temporary blip, reflecting an opportunity for those waiting on the sidelines? Let's take a closer look.\nNvidia's Data Center sales have been a focal point amid the AI frenzy, which have shown unbelievable growth over the last year as companies race to scoop up chips. Concerning its latest period, Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion once again blew away our consensus estimate and reflected another quarterly record.\nThe company's unbelievable growth has also kept valuation multiples at historically sound levels, with the current 43.0X forward 12-month earnings multiple below the 50.7X five-year median and five-year highs of 106.3X.\nIt's worth noting here that NVDA shares traded well above current valuation levels in 2020 and 2021, a time when the AI theme had yet to emerge fully.\nDespite the adverse price action, the positive story surrounding the stock remains the same. Analysts' revisions remain positive across the board, keeping the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Positive earnings estimate revisions paired with a sound valuation picture will help the stock regain its footing, and the recent dip looks to be an opportunity.\nSuper Micro Computer shares have been notably hot in 2024, gaining nearly 200% and representing the top-performing S&P 500 stock. The company is a leading provider of application-optimized, high-performance server and storage solutions that address various computational-intensive workloads, explaining the robust demand being witnessed.\nThe company earnings picture remains bright, with revisions remaining steady over the last few weeks and reflecting notable bullishness from analysts overall. Growth is expected to remain robust, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 100% EPS growth on 110% higher sales.\nShares trade at a 24.3X forward 12-month earnings multiple, showing a premium relative to historical levels but still reflecting a considerable discount from highs of 54.7X in 2024. The steeper multiple reflects investors' expectations, with the current 0.4X PEG ratio also sitting at a sound level.\nIt's worth noting that shares have reclaimed the 50-day moving average, a level that's previously caused shares to face resistance recently.\nBroadcom is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The company's recent set of quarterly results brought post-earnings fireworks, with record revenue from AI products of $3.1 billion pleasing investors.\nFollowing the print, the company raised its current-year sales outlook, with free cash flow of $5.3 billion also jumping 18% year-over-year. AVGO has long been considered a cash-generating machine, allowing it to grow its dividend payouts consistently over the years.\nAnalysts took note of the favorable quarter, raising their earnings outlooks accordingly across the board. Shares trade at a 28.9X forward 12-month earnings multiple, steeply above the five-year median but nicely beneath 2024 highs of 42.0X.\nWhile several large-cap technology stocks involved with the AI trade have faced pressure over the last week, all three companies above continue to sport bullish earnings outlooks, with revisions remaining stable.\nNothing has fundamentally changed behind the story, with market participants likely taking profits after their strong runs. All remain bullish, with earnings estimate revisions confirming the positive business trends being witnessed.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Wall Street Analysts Look Bullish on Nvidia (NVDA): Should You Buy?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Nvidia (NVDA).\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.25, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.25 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 40 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 34 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85% and 5% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Nvidia, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs NVDA a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.3% over the past month to $2.69.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Accenture AI Refinery to enable organizations to create custom models, powered by NVIDIA, enabling Llama models to be trained on their enterprise data and personalized to business needs\nNEW YORK, July 23, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Accenture (NYSE:ACN) today announced the launch of the Accenture AI Refinery\u2122 framework, built on NVIDIA AI Foundry, to enable clients to build custom LLM models with the Llama 3.1 collection of openly available models, also introduced today.\nWhile enterprises are exploring the power of gen AI, they have to distill and refine the underlying LLM models with their own data and unique processes. The Accenture AI Refinery framework, which sits within its foundation model services, marks a significant step forward in the use of generative AI for enterprises. It will enable clients to build custom LLMs with domain-specific knowledge and deploy powerful AI systems that reflect their unique business needs and help drive reinvention of their business, and their industry.\nJulie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture, said, \"The world\u2019s leading enterprises are looking to reinvent with tech, data and AI. They see how generative AI is transforming every industry and are eager to deploy applications powered by custom models. Accenture has been working with NVIDIA technology to reinvent enterprise functions and now can help clients quickly create and deploy their own custom Llama models to power transformative AI applications for their own business priorities.\"\nJensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, said, \"The introduction of Meta\u2019s openly available Llama models marks a pivotal moment for enterprise generative AI adoption, and many are seeking expert guidance and resources to create their own custom Llama LLMs. Powered by NVIDIA AI Foundry, Accenture\u2019s AI Refinery will help fuel business growth with end-to-end generative AI services for developing and deploying custom models.\"\nAccenture is also using this AI Refinery framework to reinvent its enterprise functions, initially with marketing and communications and then extending to other functions. The solution is enabling Accenture to quickly create gen AI applications that are trained for its unique business needs.\nAccenture\u2019s new AI Refinery framework has four key elements to help enterprises adapt and customize prebuilt foundation models and deploy them to reflect their unique business needs:\nDomain model customization and training: distill and refine prebuilt foundation models with customers\u2019 own data and unique processes to drive reinvention and value powered by NVIDIA AI Foundry.\nSwitchboard platform: allows a user to select a combination of models to address the business context or based on factors, such as cost or accuracy.\nEnterprise cognitive brain: scans and vectorizes all corporate data and knowledge into an enterprise-wide index to empower gen-AI machines.\nAgentic architecture: enables AI systems to act autonomously\u2014to reason, plan and propose tasks that can be executed responsibly with minimal human oversight.\nThese services will be available to all customers using Llama in Accenture AI Refinery, which is built on the NVIDIA AI Foundry service comprised of foundation models, NVIDIA NeMo and other enterprise software, accelerated computing, expert support and a broad partner ecosystem. Models created with AI Refinery can be deployed across all hyper scaler clouds with a variety of commercial options.\nAbout AccentureAccenture is a leading global professional services company that helps the world\u2019s leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services\u2014creating tangible value at speed and scale.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- The volatile U.S. political situation took another turn, with President Joe Biden dropping out of race for re-election. China has attempted to boost its struggling economy but cutting interest rates, while Nvidia is developing an AI chip for the Chinese market.\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday bowed to what seemed inevitable, and dropped out of the race for re-election amid concerns about his age and health.\nBiden backed his Vice President Kamala Harris for the job, putting her in pole position for the nomination which is officially scheduled for the Democratic convention on Aug. 19-22.\n\"My intention is to earn and win this nomination,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party \u2014 and unite our nation \u2014 to defeat Donald Trump.\"\nThis talk of unity could see the party consider a virtual nomination ahead of the convention, and Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said the party would soon announce the next steps in its nomination process.\nGoldman Sachs in a note said they did not expect the Democrats' fiscal and trade policy agenda to shift meaningfully in the event that Harris is the nominee.\nHarris could consolidate Black support and bring into sharper focus the differences between the two sides on abortion rights, an issue that has proved significant in other polls.\nBut she also faces the full weight of history as she would become the first female and only the second black President, after Barack Obama.\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Monday, bouncing after hefty losses as investors rotated out of the major technology stocks.\nBy 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 60 points, or 0.2%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 23 points, or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 125 points, or 0.6%.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell nearly 2% and 3.7%, respectively, marking their biggest weekly losses since April. On the other hand, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.7%.\nThe evolving political situation will remain in focus Monday, but there are more important earnings to digest, as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) feature in a busy week for earnings, kicking off results from the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacap group of stocks that have propelled markets since early 2023.\nIBM (NYSE:IBM), Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are among some of the other big-name companies set to report during the coming week, while Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is set to report later Monday.\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is developing a version of its flagship artificial intelligence chips for Chinese markets that will fall in line with U.S. export restrictions, according to a report by Reuters.\nThe world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker will work with Inspur, one of its biggest distributors in China, on a chip tentatively called the \u201cB20,\u201d the news agency said.\nNvidia\u2019s current AI offerings are geared specifically towards falling in line with U.S. export restrictions on China. But recent reports suggested that its offerings in the country, such as the H20, were seeing weak demand amid heavy competition from local chipmakers, specifically Huawei.\nIncreased interest in AI development has sparked a revenue bonanza for Nvidia, boosting the company\u2019s valuation to make it among the most valuable companies on Wall Street.\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China unexpectedly cut its benchmark loan prime rates further into record-low territory on Monday, in an attempt to support the country\u2019s flagging economy.\nThe PBOC cut its one-year loan prime rate to 3.35% from 3.45%, while the five-year LPR, which is used to determine mortgage prices, was cut to 3.85% from 3.95%.\nThe cuts come just a week after softer-than-expected gross domestic product data for the second quarter ramped up concerns over slowing economic growth, increasing doubts that the central bank\u2019s full-year GDP growth target will be met.\nChinese officials had promised more stimulus during the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Third Plenum last week.\nSentiment surrounding Chinese markets remains weak though, amid speculation that Donald Trump will win a second term as U.S. president.\nTrump has maintained a largely negative stance towards China. His administration had imposed steep tariffs on China, sparking a trade war with Beijing in the late-2010s.\nA second term for Trump could entail a similar scenario, which bodes poorly for the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\nCrude prices rose Monday, boosted by a surprise Chinese interest rate cut [see above], which is aimed at boosting the second largest economy in the world.\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.2% to $78.78 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $82.88 a barrel.\nConcerns over sluggish demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest oil importer, have weighed on the market, especially following softer-than-expected growth figures for the second quarter.\nThese gains may not last too long though, as although the crude market is currently tight, next year it will likely be in surplus, with Brent prices declining into the mid-to-high $70s range, Morgan Stanley said.\nThe tightness will hold for most of the third quarter, the bank said in a note dated on Friday, but equilibrium will return by the fourth quarter, \"when seasonal demand tailwinds abate and both OPEC and non-OPEC supply return to growth.\"\nMorgan Stanley said it expects OPEC and non-OPEC supply to grow by about 2.5 million barrels per day in 2025, well ahead of demand growth.\nRelated Articles\nBiden/Harris, Nvidia's chips, Chinese rate cut - what's moving markets\nTaiwan June export orders miss forecast, China demand weakens\nChina to extend tariff exemptions for some US imports until 2025\n"

        "Title": "1 Hedge Fund Manager Predicts Nvidia Will Be Worth $6 Trillion by the End of 2024. Could He Be Right?",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Wall Street remains generally bullish about Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock has skyrocketed more than 150% year to date and now boasts a market cap of nearly $3.2 trillion. Even after this huge gain, 21 of the 38 analysts surveyed by LSEG this month still recommend Nvidia as a buy or strong buy.\nBut that optimism pales in comparison to what one hedge fund manager expects. EMJ Capital's Eric Jackson predicts Nvidia will be worth $6 trillion by the end of 2024. Could he be right?\nJackson thinks Nvidia's share price will reach $250 by year-end. That's nearly twice the current share price. And it would put Nvidia's market cap at roughly $6.15 trillion, making the chipmaker the biggest company in the world by far. This prediction is either bold or boneheaded, depending on your perspective.\nThe biggest Nvidia bull on Wall Street right now is Rosenblatt Securities' Hans Mosesmann, who set a 12-month price target for the stock of $200. Mosesmann is definitely an outlier. The average price target for Nvidia is a little below the current share price, according to LSEG. Jackson's view makes Wall Street, including Mosesmann, look downright pessimistic.\nPerhaps the most audacious aspect of Jackson's prediction (other than the short amount of time he expects it will take for Nvidia to nearly double again) is his primary rationale. He thinks the main reason the stock will continue to soar is that it's still cheap.\nAswath Damodaran, an NYU finance professor known as the \"Dean of Valuation\" because of his expertise in valuing stocks, would beg to differ. In February, he crunched the numbers on Nvidia and estimated its fair value at $680 per share. Since the company conducted a 10-for-1 stock split in June, this estimate translates to a fair value of $68 per share now -- nearly 50% below its current share price.\nLet's suppose, though, that Jackson's prediction is right. How could Nvidia reach a market cap of more than $6 trillion by the end of this year? The hedge fund manager told CNBC in a recent interview:\nI think what's going to happen in the second half of the year, as people start to see how well the Blackwell chips are selling, how good the gross margins are on those, and start thinking about what's to come with the Rubin chips around the corner, I think we'll start to see that euphoria reflected in a lofty go-forward price-earnings multiple, and if that happens, this thing can go to [a] $6 trillion market cap.\nLet's unpack Jackson's statement. First, he expects exceptionally strong sales for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) based on its new Blackwell architecture. This seems to be a reasonable expectation to me. Nvidia has already indicated that the demand for these new Blackwell GPUs is greater than supply, a situation that could continue well into 2025.\nSecond, he thinks investors will be impressed with the Blackwell GPU's gross margins. Again, I suspect Jackson's view is realistic. Blackwell's total cost of ownership is 25 times lower than its Hopper GPUs with significantly lower energy consumption. I won't be surprised if the price Nvidia charges for the chips gives it a great gross margin.\nThird, Jackson anticipates that the success of the Blackwell platform will cause many investors to be excited about the further growth prospects that Nvidia's next innovation -- the Rubin architecture -- will offer. I suspect he could be right on this too.\nFourth -- and, in my view, most important -- Jackson foresees investors experiencing euphoria that drives Nvidia stock to lofty levels. Is that farfetched? Not at all.\nJackson's reasoning for his prediction that Nvidia's market cap could top $6 trillion by the end of 2024 makes sense to me. However, it calls for greater euphoria than I think is likely.\nPerhaps investors' enthusiasm about Blackwell and its successor Rubin platform will cause Nvidia stock to fly much higher than it already has. But while I think it's possible that Nvidia could be worth $6 trillion by year-end, I don't think it's probable.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Beyond Market Price: Uncovering NVIDIA Corp's Intrinsic Value",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAs of 2024-07-22, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $54.53. It's currently trading at a price of $117.93. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -116.27%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$1.75\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.22%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 41.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n84.08\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n141.64\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n54.53\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $49.31. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -139.16%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Johnny Rice, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Stock splits seem to be all the rage. After years of the step seeing less traction, 2024 already served up a slew of high-profile splits.\nThe biggest, no doubt, was Nvidia, the poster child of the current artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Some big names joined the split club, like the rapidly growing Broadcom.\nWhy split a stock? It helps open the door for smaller investors who are locked out of buying shares due to a steep price tag. On average, post-split stocks tend to perform well, but it's not a guarantee.\u00a0\u00a0 It could just be that splits tend to happen with stocks that already have positive momentum.\nYou might be curious, which company is next? I don't have a crystal ball, unfortunately, but here are my three picks for which companies it could be.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is emerging as one of the strongest AI plays. It has a massive amount of engaged daily users -- 3.2 billion by the company's count. This number is up 7% year over year\u00a0across its different platforms, which stand to benefit greatly from the tools the company collectively calls Meta AI.\nThe company saw its earnings per share (EPS) more than double last quarter, compared to the year before. This came with a nearly 30% jump in revenue and a huge bump in operating margin. The company also cut 10% of its staff this year.\nThis success drove its share price up 83% since last year. Now hovering above $500, it's the most expensive stock of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nMeta has never split its stock since it's been on the market. It seems ripe for a split.\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) went on a tear this year with a year-to-date gain that would make Nvidia blush. The semiconductor company also designs and manufactures hardware critical for AI but arguably has a more diversified revenue stream than Nvidia.\nThe two actually work together. Supermicro uses Nvidia's chips in its data center servers.\nSupermicro has a lot of growth ahead. Of course, predicting the future is always difficult, but consensus estimates put the company's 2024 EPS growth at more than 100% from last year.\nSupermicro's shares are already expensive, trading near $900. If these estimates hold true, this company could easily be trading at a significantly higher price. It seems likely a split is coming for SMCI, as well.\nCalling Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) an AI company might be a stretch. They do make shows about AI -- if you haven't watched Black Mirror, please do -- but that hardly seems to qualify.\nThe company has actually employed AI for a while, or at least machine learning, the technology at the core of AI. Every large language model (LLM) you see on the market, like ChatGPT, is based on machine learning algorithms.\nThe algorithms Netflix employs learn what you like and what you don't. Based on this, they provide you recommendations. The more you use it, the better it gets. The company helped pioneer this feature that's now standard across all streaming platforms.\nNetflix leads the streaming pack with more than 260 million subscribers. That's a lot of eyeballs that make the service valuable. The company is capitalizing on this, instituting new programs to raise revenue. It seems to be working as consensus estimates put this year's earnings-per-share (EPS) growth at roughly 40% year over year.\nNetflix stock is trading at nearly $700. That's already at a level that could benefit from a stock split. That may well be what happens, but only time will tell.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 22, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Nvidia NVDA.\nMany in the market are looking to the two members of 'the Magnificent 7' who report quarterly results this week to help reverse the stock market's recent weakness.\nThe immediate catalyst for the stock market pullback appears to be renewed uncertainty about regulatory and trade policies following the November elections, particularly with respect to export restrictions on semiconductor players. That said, we are in a seasonally soft time of the year and should perhaps resist the temptation to read too much into the recent weakness of the Mag 7 stocks, particularly given these stocks' impressive runs already.\nTeslais in a league of its own (up +21.3% since July 1st), while Microsoft (down -2.3%) and Alphabet (down -2.2%) are roughly tracking each other.\nThis pecking order, with Tesla at the top and Amazon and Nvidia at the bottom, is completely reversed when the starting point is changed to the start of 2024 instead of the start of 2024 Q3.\nWe have Tesla and Alphabet on deck to report Q2 results this week, both reporting after the market's close on Tuesday, July 23rd.\nThe current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS for Alphabet of $1.85 has remained unchanged over the last two months, as has Tesla's Q2 EPS estimate of $0.62.\nFor Alphabet, the Q2 estimates of $1.85 per share on $70.6 billion in revenues represent year-over-year changes of +13.7% and +28.5%, respectively. Tesla's Q2 EPS estimate is -31.9% below the year-earlier period on +0.8% higher revenues.\nBoth stocks move big on the earnings release, but the EPS surprise isn't always the most important factor behind the stock's post-release reaction. Alphabet shares were up following the last quarterly release on April 25th, with the market appreciating the company's cloud results and AI outlook.\nTesla missed on the top and bottom-lines in the April 23rd quarterly release, but the stock was up following the numbers as the market liked the company's performance on the deliveries front. In fact, Tesla shares have been on a steady uptrend since the April 23rd release, reversing the persistent underperformance of the preceding period.\nThe other Mag 7 players will report the following week, with Nvidia being the last one to release quarterly results on August 28th.\nThe group is expected to bring in +25.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.3% higher revenues.\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. The group returned to the 'regular/normal' growth model last year, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +15.5% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues.\nAs with the Mag 7, the Tech sector dealt with the pulled-forward revenues but is expected to remain firmly in growth mode.\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trend. The current +17.2% earnings growth expected for the group is up from +14.2% three months ago. Estimates for next year have also gone up.\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, July 19th, we have seen Q2 results from 71 S&P 500 members, or 14.2% of the index's membership. Total earnings for these 71 index members are up +8.7% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 83.1% beating EPS estimates and only 53.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\nThe Q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week, with more than 500 companies on deck to report results, including 135 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Alphabet and Tesla, this week's line-up includes a representative cross-section of reports from different sectors, including bellwethers like Verizon and AT&T, UPS, Coke, GM and Ford, Spotify, IBM, Chipotle, and others.\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, 53.5% is a new low for this group of 71 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues. This will be the highest quarterly growth pace since the +10% earnings growth rate in the 2022 Q1 period.\nAs we have been flagging all along in this space, we experienced a notably favorable revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season, with estimates for Q2 holding up far better than other recent periods. In the three-month period from the start of the quarter through June 30th, Q2 estimates for the S&P 500 index fell the least relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.\nNot only is the Q2 earnings growth the highest since the first quarter of 2022, but the absolute level of aggregate earnings for the period is also on track to be a new all-time quarterly record.\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.8% on +1.6% revenue growth.\nThe expected revenue growth pace improves to +3.9% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +8.7% on an ex-Finance basis.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q2 Earnings Season Starts Positively\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) reached a significant support level, and could be a good pick for investors from a technical perspective. Recently, NVDA broke through the 20-day moving average, which suggests a short-term bullish trend.\nA well-liked tool among traders, the 20-day simple moving average offers a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. This is very beneficial to short-term traders, as it smooths out short-term price trends and gives more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.\nLike other SMAs, if a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.\nOver the past four weeks, NVDA has gained 5.3%. The company is currently ranked a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), another strong indication the stock could move even higher.\nThe bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account NVDA's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 15 revisions higher for the current fiscal year compared to none lower, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nInvestors may want to watch NVDA for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Why Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Stock in Obama\u2019s Portfolio?",
        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Obama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year Returns. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks in former U.S. president Barack Obama's portfolio.\nFormer United States President Barack Obama took office during one of the worst recessions in U.S. history, yet the stock market reached new highs during his tenure. Stepping into office in 2009, the year after stocks plummeted nearly 40% amid the financial crisis of 2007-2008, Obama made a remarkably well-timed market prediction. On March 3, 2009, just days before the S&P 500 hit an intraday low of 666 and a closing low of 676.53, the then-president stated, \"What you're now seeing is profit-and-earnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you've got a long-term perspective on it.\" By the time he left office on January 20, 2017, the S&P 500 had soared to 2,263.69, reflecting a gain of about 225% since his predictive remark.\nThe \"Obama Years\" coincided with rapid technological advancements that significantly impacted the stock market. Apple Inc.'s iPhone, introduced less than two years before he took office, exemplified this era of innovation. In addition, during Obama's presidency, billionaire Reed Hastings transformed Netflix Inc. from a DVD rental-by-mail company into a video-streaming giant, revolutionizing entertainment consumption. On the other hand, renewable energy, particularly solar energy, struggled during the president's tenure. Despite the administration's solar subsidies, investors were largely disappointed as those subsidies eventually faded. First Solar Inc., one of the largest U.S. solar equipment producers, saw its stock plummet by as much as 74% due to falling solar panel prices, making it the worst-performing S&P 500 stock of the Obama era.\nFrom speaking at events worldwide to writing memoirs and signing a major production deal with Netflix, the Obamas have led a busy and highly lucrative life post-White House. Michelle Obama's first memoir, \"Becoming,\" published in November 2018, became that year's No. 1 best-selling book. Her second book, \"The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times,\" also achieved bestseller status. Similarly, Barack Obama's latest memoir, \"A Promised Land,\" sold nearly 890,000 copies within 24 hours of its November 2020 release. These ventures, along with the six-figure pension that all former presidents receive, have significantly boosted the Obamas' net worth, which is at least $70 million according to the International Business Times. The New York Post, however, estimates their fortune to be much higher, at $135 million.\nOf course, Barack Obama\u2019s income isn\u2019t limited to speaking fees and pensions. Like many other wealthy individuals, he has invested significantly in the stock market. So what does his portfolio look like? When he took office in 2009, Obama, like all presidents, was required to make financial disclosures by law. At that time, Obama held $200,000-$450,000 in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares that tracks the S&P 500 index, according to a report by CBS News.\nOur Methodology\nThese investments were selected from the top holdings of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares, one of Barack Obama's primary investments during his presidency, according to official disclosures. We have provided each stock's trailing 10-year returns to assess their performance over the decade. Data from approximately 919 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024 was also analyzed to determine the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each firm.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple, our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy picks 14 small and large-caps every quarter and it has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNote: The stocks are sorted in ascending order of their trailing 10-year returns.\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 186\nTrailing 10-Year Returns: 70.55%\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading multinational technology company known for designing and selling GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) for various applications, including gaming, cryptocurrency mining, and professional uses. Additionally, NVIDIA provides chip systems for sectors such as vehicles, robotics, and other tools. It is one of the top stocks in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stock has continued its market-leading rally this year, pushing the AI chip leader's valuation past $3 trillion and increasing its influence within the S&P 500. Notably, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) alone accounts for 34.5% of the S&P 500\u2019s market cap gains so far this year, according to Apollo Chief Economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k. The stock has soared 173.78% year-to-date and is up more than 208.92% from a year ago, driven by the AI craze gripping Wall Street. The company\u2019s quarterly earnings indicate that the demand for AI chips shows no signs of slowing.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s latest product announcements and plans unveiled at Computex demonstrate its robust growth potential. Analysts highlight the company's transition to a new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips, which are seen as superior to competitors' offerings.\nDuring the first quarter of this year, Insider Monkey\u2019s research revealed that 186 out of the 919 hedge funds covered had invested in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Among these investors, Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners emerged as the largest shareholder with a $12.07 billion investment in the company.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThis quarter we entered two new positions, while exiting four positions. Our first new position was\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), which we bought early in the quarter.\u00a0Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has\u00a0recently benefited from the insatiable demand\u00a0of\u00a0artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and FCF an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While much\u00a0of the focus is on Nvidia\u2019s market\u00a0cap\u00a0reaching\u00a0$2.3T, up 230% over the last year, the\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0valuation\u00a0has\u00a0actually come\u00a0down over that period. As of 3/31/23, consensus was valuing the company at 61x forward EPS. This compares\u00a0to today, where the company is\u00a0being valued\u00a0at 37x. While yes, we have never seen a company expand their market cap by so much so quickly, we have also never seen a company grow their fundamental earnings and cash generation so quickly (and which is\u00a0actually expanding\u00a0faster than valuation).\u00a0While competitors are working to enter the GPU space,\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0has\u00a0created a moat around their GPUs with their CUDA software offering. While we do expect the large cloud players to continue to move into the market, we think NVDA can continue to demand top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the\u00a0company is well positioned for the increased adoption of accelerated computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of former U.S. president Barack Obama's portfolio stocks. You can visit Obama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year Returns\u00a0to see the other stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Attention, Growth Investors: This Biotech Stock Is Crushing Nvidia.",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If you're an investor focused on growth, you may have spent a fair share of your time at least watching Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock in recent times -- even if you haven't jumped in to invest in this high-flyer. Nvidia dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, and that's helped the company deliver triple-digit gains in revenue and profit. The stock has followed, climbing 126% so far this year.\nBut Nvidia isn't the only player generating big returns for investors. In fact, an up-and-coming biotech stock actually has been crushing Nvidia in recent months. This stock has advanced 247% since the start of the year. And this past week, the stock soared more than 28% in one trading session after the company announced one of its product candidates would begin a late-stage clinical trial.\nLet's find out more about this stock that's beating Nvidia -- and whether it's a buy right now for growth investors.\nThis top-performing biotech is Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX), a company working on candidates for metabolic and endocrine disorders -- and the program that's caught investors' attention is one targeting weight loss. Big pharma companies already are generating billions of dollars in revenue from weight loss drugs, so success in the space could lead to major revenue for Viking too.\nViking is developing injectable and oral GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonists, treatments that act on hormones controlling blood sugar levels and appetite. Just last week, the company said it's advancing VK-2735, its injectable candidate, into a phase 3 trial and has scheduled an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for later this year. In the phase 2 trial, VK-2735 delivered fantastic results, with the drug resulting in as much as 15% weight loss after 13 weeks of treatment.\nAt the same time, Viking announced the oral version of the potential drug would move into a phase 2 trial later this year after producing mean weight loss of as much as 5.3% after 28 days of dosing.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the news prompted a double-digit gain for the stock in just one trading session. Viking has shown such momentum in the past, soaring 120% in one February trading session after first announcing results from the VK-2735 clinical trial.\nInvestors are optimistic because the weight loss drug market is a high-growth one -- and it's set to keep on expanding. The market may increase by 16 to reach $100 billion by the end of the decade, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Today, pharma giant Eli Lilly already sells two GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonists and Novo Nordisk markets two similar drugs -- and demand for all of them has exceeded supply. This tells us there's room in the market for other players, and all of them could be very successful.\nOn top of this, there's also the possibility that a big pharmaceutical or biotech company may offer to buy Viking as a way to enter the weight loss space.\nAll of this has pushed shares of Viking to major gains this year, with performance even surpassing that of AI powerhouse Nvidia.\nSo, if you're a growth investor, should you pile into Viking shares right now? This depends on your appetite for risk. If you're a growth investor who favors companies with a strong existing revenue stream, Viking isn't the right stock for you. The biotech doesn't yet have products on the market, and even if all goes well for VK-2735, commercialization isn't right around the corner -- analysts expect it as of later this decade. Of course, a potential buyout could happen at any point and likely would lift the shares -- but this wouldn't result in a quicker time to market for a potential product.\nI would even argue that the stock's gains have come pretty quickly, especially for a company that doesn't yet generate product revenue.\nThat said, if you're a growth investor who's comfortable with some risk, you may want to add a few Viking shares to your portfolio right now. As clinical development continues, each data report may represent a new catalyst for stock performance -- and so far, Viking has shown the strength of its potential products, offering us reason to be optimistic.\nIt's impossible to guarantee that this high-flying biotech will continue to outperform growth powerhouse Nvidia in the coming months. But here's the good news: Even if it doesn't, it still could score a win for your growth portfolio over time if the company's promising weight-loss candidates continue progressing toward the finish line.\nBefore you buy stock in Viking Therapeutics, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Viking Therapeutics wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  George Budwell, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "When the 2024 stock market story is penned, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) will undoubtedly take center stage. The chipmaker powering the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has achieved a staggering 165% gain in the first half of the year.\nFurthermore, it's responsible for a significant portion of the S&P 500's nearly 16% gain at the midpoint of 2024. Nvidia's high-powered graphics processing units (GPUs) have experienced surging demand this year, driven by the ongoing AI superbuild.\nThis incredible growth story does have an important caveat, however. Nvidia's shares now trade at a lofty 77 times trailing earnings, a valuation that raises eyebrows by any standard. While a compelling case can be made that the company merits this premium valuation and its bull run is still in its early stages, prudence may be advisable at this juncture.\nHere's an overview of three popular Vanguard exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that can provide substantial exposure to Nvidia and a degree of safety through the power of diversification.\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index, providing broad exposure to large-cap U.S. stocks. As of the latest data, Nvidia comprises approximately 6.1% of the fund's holdings, making it a significant contributor to the ETF's performance. Nvidia is also the fund's third-largest holding, as of this writing.\nWhy else is the Vanguard S&P 500 worth considering? The fund comes with an ultra-low expense ratio of 0.03%, it provides broad diversification across 500 of the largest U.S. companies, and automatic rebalancing. Most importantly, this ETF offers investors a way to capture Nvidia's eye-popping growth while spreading risk across the entire S&P 500 index.\nThe Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSEMKT: VUG) focuses on large-cap U.S. growth stocks, which typically include technology and consumer discretionary companies. Nvidia is the fund's third-largest holding, accounting for a whopping 10.6% of its portfolio at the time of this writing.\nIn addition to its significant stake in Nvidia, the Vanguard Growth Index Fund has an extremely low expense ratio of 0.04%, built-in exposure to companies with above-average growth potential, and a higher concentration in tech stocks, compared to the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. This ETF provides a focused approach to growth stocks, potentially offering higher returns but with increased volatility, compared to the broader market.\nFor investors seeking maximum exposure to Nvidia and the tech sector more broadly, the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSEMKT: VGT) is an excellent option. This ETF tracks the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 index, with Nvidia representing approximately 14% of the fund's holdings.\nAdditionally, the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF Shares sports an acceptable expense ratio of 0.10%, concentrated exposure to the information technology sector, and the potential for higher returns on capital than either the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF or the Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF.\nFrom a big-picture perspective, this ETF offers the highest concentration of Nvidia among the three options but also comes with increased sector-specific risk. The informational technology sector is widely anticipated to be a central pillar of global economic growth in the years to come, but nothing in this life is a sure thing. Goldman Sachs, after all, recently released a stinging criticism of the AI-fueled stock rally, calling the long-term sustainability of the trend into question.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nAs of 2024-07-08, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $54.53. It's currently trading at a price of $125.83. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -130.75%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run.

A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 41.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n84.08\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n141.64\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n54.53\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $49.31. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -155.18%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Can Amazon Compete with Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft in the Market Cap Race?",
        "Author": "  Jennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft regained the title of most valuable company in the world after briefly falling behind Nvidia with the latter's recent stock split. However, it's been playing second fiddle to Apple for years and only recently slid into first place since Apple has been under some pressure.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is only in fifth place on the list of U.S. companies with the highest market caps, also behind Alphabet. It has extraordinary growth opportunities in several of its businesses, and the second-highest sales of any U.S. company behind Walmart. Can it become the most valuable company in the world?\nMarket cap is simply the price per share multiplied by the outstanding share count. In other words, it's the total dollar value of all of a company's stock. Amazon stock trades at $193 per share, and there are 10.4 billion shares outstanding, so the market cap is over $2 trillion. That makes it the fifth most-valuable company on the stock market.\nAs you can see in the chart above, Apple had been the most valuable company until recently, when Microsoft took over and Nvidia briefly topped it.\nMarket cap tells investors a few things. Highly valued companies are best in class, and they have proved that over time. Investors have piled in because these companies perform, quarter after quarter, and they're large businesses that drive the economy. In general, you can count on them to deliver, and they're low risk.\nBut highly valued companies might offer less growth for investors, since they're already so valuable. For the top three stocks here to even double at this point, they would be worth more than $6 trillion.\nIs it possible? Yes. But that comes with its own risk, since they would need to sustain their high value. It's easier to see Amazon or Alphabet doubling from where they are today.\nIn terms of valuation, none of these stocks are cheap. They all get a premium valuation for their reliable track records and incredible businesses. Nvidia tops them, trading at 73 times trailing-12-month earnings, and Amazon comes in second at 55.\nAmazon struggled a bit, like many companies, when inflation started soaring in 2022. It rebounded already last year, but the stock only surpassed its previous highs a few weeks ago, and it could be in its best position in a long time.\nOne reason is generative artificial intelligence (AI). It's today's hot topic, but it might have more staying power than other recent trends like cryptocurrency and the metaverse, and Amazon is a major player.\nIt has launched a powerful set of AI tools for its Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients, and as the leading worldwide cloud computing company, it stands to benefit in a big way from adoption of these tools. According to consulting company McKinsey, as much as 30% of workplace hours could be automated through generative AI, and it could add $4.4 trillion to the economy.\nAmazon is at the forefront of these endeavors, and CEO Andy Jassy recently said, \"I don't know if any of us have seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time.\"\nBut it's not just AI, with Jassy adding, \"We have a lot of growth in front of us, and that's before the generative AI opportunity.\" He said that AWS is already a $100 billion run-rate business, and that 85% of global spending on information technology is still on-premises, meaning not in the cloud. That leaves a massive opportunity for further spending in AWS.\nAnd AWS isn't even its biggest business, which is still e-commerce. Amazon has an unbeatable lead in that category globally and accounts for nearly 38% of all U.S. e-commerce. It has made strides in improving logistics to get more deliveries out faster, and as it speeds up shipments, more shoppers rely on it for even more of their daily essentials, leading to a positive growth cycle.\nThe company's fastest-growing business these days is advertising, which increased 24% year over year in the 2024 first quarter. It's a high-margin business, and with its new ad-supported streaming tier for Prime Video, Amazon is finding more ways to monetize its advertising capabilities.\nIt has an edge in this business because when customers see advertisements on the company's platform, they're already looking to buy, and that can lead to incredible conversion rates.\nAmazon can certainly muscle its way to the top of the market-value chain, just as it's pushing ahead and getting closer to becoming the largest U.S. company by sales. Regardless, it has tremendous opportunities in many ways, and its stock is a no-brainer buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 1, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights AMD AMD and Nvidia NVDA.\nAs we continue receiving quarterly results from big tech firms, AMD stands out after exceeding its Q2 top and bottom line expectations Tuesday evening.\nWith AMD shares spiking over +10% in this morning's trading session, investors may be wondering if it\u2019s time to buy stock in the chip leader following its favorable Q2 Report.\nAMD\u2019s Q2 growth was driven by its Instinct, Ryzen, and EPYC processors which accelerate AI workloads. Designed to compete with Nvidia\u2019s AI chips, the Instinct MI300X was a key driver to AMD\u2019s expansion, seeing high demand from cloud and enterprise providers.\nThis led to Q2 sales rising 9% year over year to $5.83 billion which came in 2% above estimates of $5.7 billion. More impressive, Q2 EPS of $0.69 beat expectations by 3% while spiking 19% from $0.58 a share in the comparative quarter. AMD has surpassed earnings expectations in three of its last four quarterly reports posting an average EPS surprise of 2.32%\nFor the third quarter, AMD is expecting strong growth in its Data Center and Client segments and projects Q3 revenue to be $6.7 billion plus or minus $300 million. This came in slightly above the current Zacks Consensus of $6.58 billion or 13% growth (Current Qtr below).\nAdditionally, AMD announced it will be completing the acquisition of Silo AI during Q3 for $665 million. Notably, Silo AI is Europe\u2019s largest private artificial intelligence company.\nThe Silo team is expected to expand AMD\u2019s capability to service large enterprise customers looking to optimize their AI solutions. Silo will also bring deep expertise in large language model development to help accelerate optimization of inference and training solutions.\nYear to date, AMD\u2019s stock is still down -2% which has noticeably lagged the broader indexes and Nvidia\u2019s +132%. However, over the last two years, AMD\u2019s +49% has topped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq although this has lagged Nvidia\u2019s stellar gains of over +500%.\nAMD\u2019s stock currently trades at 40.6X forward earnings which is a premium to the S&P 500\u2019s 22.9X but closer to Nvidia\u2019s 38.5X. Furthermore, AMD trades well below its five-year high of 107.2X forward earnings and at a noticeable discount to the median of 52.5X.\nAMD\u2019s stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While it may be too soon to say an extended rebound is in store for AMD\u2019s stock this year, the company\u2019s growth trajectory remains attractive and the acquisition of Silo AI should be promising for its long-term prospects as well.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.
