        "Text": "You would be hard-pressed to find an investor who doesn't consider Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) the pinnacle of artificial intelligence (AI) companies. Its graphics processing units (GPUs), which crunch AI workloads, are best in class by a wide margin and have been used by practically every company interested in AI.\nBut are there any companies that could dethrone Nvidia?\nPart of the fear of investing in Nvidia is wondering what will happen if and when the music stops. Right now, the company is firing on all cylinders. But the question remains: What happens when enough GPUs have been purchased to satisfy AI demand?\nThere are some factors influencing the answer to that question, such as the average lifespan of a GPU used for server computing. That is estimated to be around three to five years, which would mean there will be a replacement cycle. But if the demand for Nvidia GPUs is met, then the next round of AI technology might look somewhat different.\nIf that happens, which company could take the spot atop the AI mountain? Some might point to Advanced Micro Devices as a potential successor. AMD competes directly with Nvidia in the data center GPU space but has been getting smoked.\nHowever, AMD has recently generated momentum with various cloud-computing providers starting to add its GPUs as an alternative. They don't want to be devoted solely to Nvidia hardware because that would give it too much pricing power over them. But because Nvidia still has much better technology, AMD will likely only be considered as an alternative.\nAnother candidate is Taiwan Semiconductor, (TSMC for short), the chip foundry that supplies Nvidia and thereby makes its products possible. But TSMC also supplies chips to AMD and other companies, which makes it a neutral factor in the AI investment race.\nBesides, TSMC expects massive growth driven by AI demand over the next few years. In its latest conference call, management said, \"For the next five years, we forecast [AI revenue] to grow at 50% [compound annual growth rate] and increase to higher than 20% of our revenue by 2028.\" That's strong growth, but it also means Nvidia could continue its dominance since it's a key customer for TSMC.\nBut all of the above is just the hardware side; what about application and use?\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are both massive customers for Nvidia's GPUs. Not only do they have internal uses for them, but they also buy them to power their respective cloud computing services.\nThey also started designing their own AI chips, so they don't have to buy them from Nvidia. However, these chips are highly workload-specific, so general-purpose GPUs like Nvidia's will still account for the lion's share of computing power.\nSoftware companies like Palantir are also bringing AI capabilities to the masses. Its clients still need plenty of computing power to run its models, and it gives them the tools to create them. This could make the company a potential successor to Nvidia as a leading AI investment, since it will continue to see demand for its platform long after AI computing capacity is built out.\nBut all roads lead back to Nvidia, which is why it has been and will continue to be the most popular AI investment. Nvidia is on top of the AI world right now, and there currently doesn't appear to be any company that can dethrone it.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "How High Can Nvidia Stock Go?",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "At the beginning of June last year, I wrote an article with an identical headline to try and find how much upside is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock capable of delivering, and I have to admit that my prediction was way off.\nShares of Nvidia have shot up 196% since that article was published last year, more than tripling in value. My estimate was that this high-flying semiconductor stock could almost double in value over a three-year period, but it exceeded those expectations by a massive margin.\nLet's see why that has been the case and check how much upside this high-flying chipmaker can deliver following the outstanding gains it has clocked in the past year.\nA year ago, analysts were expecting Nvidia to deliver $42.9 billion in revenue and $7.68 per share in earnings for fiscal 2024. Instead, the company ended the fiscal year with adjusted earnings of $12.96 per share on revenue of $60.9 billion. It is also worth noting that analysts were forecasting Nvidia to deliver revenue of $50.6 billion for fiscal 2025 followed by $62.7 billion in fiscal 2026.\nHowever, as the following chart indicates, analysts' expectations for Nvidia have simply rocketed in the past year.\nThat's not surprising, as the chipmaker has been delivering better-than-expected growth quarter after quarter thanks to the massive demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips. For instance, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on April 28), Nvidia's revenue increased 262% year over year to $26 billion, and earnings increased 461% to $6.12 per share.\nSuch strong growth has led analysts to raise their growth expectations for the company further, as reflected in the previous chart. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says this terrific growth is here to stay as \"companies and countries are partnering with Nvidia to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center -- AI factories -- to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence.\"\nInvestors should note that Nvidia is playing a pioneering role in the proliferation of AI with its hardware and software offerings. The company controlled a massive 94% of the market for AI graphics processing units (GPUs) last year, and it is witnessing little competition in this space despite the efforts of its rivals. With the global GPU market forecast to post annual growth of 31% through 2032 and generate $594 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period, there is room for Nvidia to keep growing at a robust pace in the long run.\nMoreover, Nvidia has other catalysts beyond the AI data center market. It is the leading provider of GPUs used in personal computers (PCs) as well with an estimated market share of 88%. This puts the company in a solid position to record healthy incremental growth in the future thanks to the lucrative opportunity present in the overall GPU market.\nInvestors have already seen how fast Nvidia's top line is expected to grow over the next three fiscal years. The good part is that the revenue growth is set to filter down to the bottom line as well. Analysts are expecting the company's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 43% for the next five years. Based on its fiscal 2024 earnings of $1.21 per share, Nvidia's bottom line could jump to $7.24 per share after five years.\nMultiplying the projected earnings after five years with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 29 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks) points toward a stock price of $210. That would be a 78% jump from current levels.\nHowever, with the trillion-dollar end-market opportunity that the company is sitting on and the rapid pace at which its end-markets, such as AI chips, are growing, it won't be surprising to see this tech stock delivering stronger gains over the next five years and exceeding the $200 Street-high price target.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Prediction: This Move From Nvidia in the Second Half Will Be Much Bigger Than the Stock Split",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has soared over the past few years, and the stock added to gains in recent times when it announced something a lot of investors had been waiting for: a stock split. The company decided to launch a 10-for-1 split to bring its shares down to a level that would make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy. These operations involve the issuance of more shares to current holders to make that happen.\nPrior to the operation, Nvidia surged to more than $1,000 a share \u2014 a level that may be a psychological barrier for some investors and a difficult buy for those aiming to take a small position. Now, with Nvidia shares trading around $120, these problems have disappeared. So, though stock splits aren't catalysts for share performance, they can represent a positive move for a company.\nBut Nvidia's big moves this year aren't over. In fact, Nvidia has something major planned for the second half. My prediction is this move from the artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant will be much bigger than the stock split \u2014 and offer you a great reason to buy the stock. Let's check out what's ahead.\nOf course, gaining access to Nvidia for a lower per-share price, thanks to the stock split, is exciting, but it's important to remember that splits don't change a company's valuation: Nvidia isn't any cheaper today than it was prior to the split. In fact, a stock split doesn't change anything fundamental.\nThis upcoming move, however, will. First, a bit of background. Nvidia already is the world's AI chip leader, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) holding 80% share of the market. This is because Nvidia's GPUs are the fastest around, powering critical AI tasks like training and inferencing \u2014 the processes that help large language models do their job of solving complex tasks.\nNvidia also sells a variety of related AI products and services that make it the go-to destination for those launching an AI project. All of this has helped the company increase revenue and net income in the triple digits quarter after quarter.\nNow, moving along to my prediction: Nvidia's upcoming launch of its Blackwell architecture and best chip yet is much bigger news for the company and could represent a significant catalyst for the stock in the near term as well as over time as this platform adds to revenue.\nBlackwell could be a game changer because it represents a whole new way of powering AI, achieving incredible performance at a cost and energy consumption that's as much as 25 times lower than Hopper, the previous system. This is a critical feature because this savings reduces an AI customer's overall costs, potentially making the Nvidia system the most economical choice over time.\nBlackwell includes six transformative innovations, including the world's most powerful chip; the next generation Nvidia NVLink to offer high-speed communication among as many as 576 GPUs; a system of preventative maintenance to maximize system function; and more. And the Blackwell GPU offers as much as four-times-faster training and 30-times-faster inference than Nvidia's current leading chip, the H100.\nAnd now the really good news is this: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply, and he expects this to continue into next year. The launch strategy, making Blackwell available in more than 100 original equipment manufacturer and original design manufacturer systems, could ensure a strong start. All of this is reason to be optimistic about the platform's debut and its contribution to revenue in the coming quarters.\nThe Blackwell launch also may reassure investors who worry about rivals taking market share from the chip giant because it should set Nvidia significantly ahead.\nSo, even though Nvidia made headlines for its stock split in recent times, the upcoming launch of Blackwell is much bigger news \u2014 and news that could help this already top-performing AI stock continue its gains in the second half and beyond. And that makes Nvidia a great buy now, even after its 150% increase in the first half of the year.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) recently executed a 10-for-1 stock split to reset its share price, which had surged 725% during the preceding 18 months. The driving force behind that performance was booming interest in artificial intelligence. However, the odds are now stacked against Nvidia. History says the stock is headed for a sharp decline.\nNvidia announced its stock split on May 22, and its share price has since increased 33%. But since 2010, companies have seen their share prices increase just 18.3% on average during the 12 months following a stock split announcement, according to Bank of America. That implies about 15% downside for Nvidia over the next 11 months.\nEven more worrisome, Nvidia has consistently lost momentum following previous stock splits. Here's what happened the last five times.\nNvidia has completed six stock splits as a public company. The last five splits are listed in the chart below, along with the share price appreciation (or depreciation) over the next six months, one year, and two years. Generally speaking, Nvidia has performed poorly following stock splits.\nStock Split Date\n6-Month Return\n1-Year Return\n2-Year Return\nJune 2000\n(50%)\n28%\n(52%)\nSeptember 2001\n44%\n(72%)\n(49%)\nApril 2006\n63%\n1%\n(6%)\nSeptember 2007\n(45%)\n(70%)\n(53%)\nJuly 2021\n30%\n(4%)\n145%\nAverage\n8%\n(23%)\n(3%)\nData source: YCharts.\nAs shown above, Nvidia returned an average of 8% during the six-month period following past stock splits. But shares declined by an average of 23% during the first year, and they were still down 3% on average after two years. Past performance is never a guarantee of future results, but we can apply that information to the current situation to make an educated guess.\nSpecifically, Nvidia shares have advanced 4% since the company executed its 10-for-1 stock split on June 7. That implies 4% upside through December 2024. But it implies 27% downside by June 2025 and 7% downside through June 2026. However, drawing comparisons to the current situation is difficult because the last five stock splits happened near market crashes.\nMost notably, the dot-com bubble became a bear market between March 2000 and October 2002, during which the S&P 500 declined 49%. And the subprime mortgage crisis became a bear market between October 2007 and March 2009, during which the S&P 500 declined 57%.\nThe fifth stock split also occurred in close proximity to a bear market. The S&P 500 tumbled 25% between January 2022 and October 2022. But Nvidia shareholders were probably saved from steep losses by the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the generative AI application that sparked unprecedented demand for Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).\nNvidia specializes in accelerated computing, a discipline that employs special hardware and software to speed-up complex data center workloads like analytics and artificial intelligence. Nvidia holds more than 90% market share in data center GPUs, and as much as 95% market share in artificial intelligence chips.\nOne reason for that success is superior hardware. Nvidia systems regularly set records at the MLPerf benchmarks, which offer unbiased evaluations of AI hardware and software across training and inference use cases. Analysts at Forrester Research recently wrote, \"Nvidia sets the pace for AI infrastructure worldwide. Without Nvidia GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\nAnother reason for that success is extensive software. Nvidia's CUDA programming language makes it easy for developers to train AI models and build GPU-accelerated applications. The CUDA platform comprises hundreds of software libraries and frameworks that streamline development. No other chipmaker offers a comparable ecosystem of supporting software.\nFinally, Nvidia also provides data center hardware beyond GPUs, including central processing units (CPUs) and networking equipment optimized for AI. The former is ramping toward a multi-billion-dollar product line, and the latter is already a $12 billion business. Additionally, Nvidia complements its hardware portfolio with subscription software and cloud services that further assist developers in building and running AI applications.\nIn short, Nvidia offers a full-stack accelerated computing platform, which affords the company a nearly insurmountable competitive advantage. Consider the following commentary from Wall Street analysts.\nHarlan Sur at JPMorgan Chase expects Nvidia to stay one to two steps ahead of competitors due to its full-stack strategy, large ecosystem of CUDA developers, and rapid product innovation.\nJim Kelleher at Argus recently wrote, \"Nvidia's expertise, market leadership, and continued investments in new technology puts it several generations ahead of its rivals and give it a sustainable competitive advantage.\"\nAngelo Zino at CFRA recently wrote, \"On the software side, [Nvidia's] competitive moat appears stronger than ever given its ability to control the entire stack.\"\nBrian Colello at Morningstar says \"Nvidia not only has a hardware lead, but benefits from high customer switching costs around CUDA, making it unlikely for another GPU vendor to emerge as a leader in AI training.\"\nNvidia has reported stunning financial results in recent quarters. The chart below provides details on revenue and non-GAAP net income growth.\nGoing forward, Wall Street analysts think Nvidia's earnings per share will increase at 32% annually over the next three to five years. That estimate puts its current valuation of 74 times earnings somewhere between reasonable and expensive.\nPersonally, I think growth-focused investors should have a position in Nvidia. Anyone that lacks such a position should consider buying a few shares today, provided they are comfortable with the risks. Nvidia has historically performed poorly following stock splits, and shares could plunge if the company fails to meet Wall Street's lofty earnings expectations.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the biggest bellwether for the technology sector right now. Moreover, gains in megacap technology giants such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and more are helping fuel the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to record highs.\nWith shares up nearly 180% so far in 2024, Nvidia recently became the largest company in the world by market cap. Some investors may think it's too late to hop on the Nvidia train. Alternatively, as shares of the semiconductor giant continue to rocket on a seemingly daily basis, investors may be looking for alternative options in the AI chip realm.\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) could just be what you're looking for. Let's dig into why this exchange-traded fund (ETF) looks like a great opportunity for long-term investors interested in semiconductor businesses beyond Nvidia.\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF holds stock in 25 semiconductor companies. While Nvidia is the fund's largest position with a 25.7% weighting, other prominent holdings include Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom, ASML Holdings, Qualcomm, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices.\nOne of the reasons I like the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is because it provides investors with exposure to many pockets of the AI chip market. For example, while Intel and AMD are competing directly with Nvidia in the graphics processing unit (GPU) space, positions such as Qualcomm and Broadcom give investors a passive position in markets related to chip applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), smart home appliances, mobile devices, and network infrastructure.\nMoreover, Qualcomm in particular is an interesting opportunity considering the company's ongoing turnaround efforts. Given expectations are fairly low, I see Qualcomm as a potentially lucrative opportunity should the company continue executing on its growth initiatives.\nFurthermore, one of my favorite and most respected smart money hedge fund managers, Brad Gerstner, just added Broadcom to his portfolio. I think this move adds some credibility to Broadcom specifically as well as the company's role in the AI revolution.\nThe table breaks down the average annual total returns of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF across various time periods.\n1 Year\n3 Years\n5 Years\n10 Years\n67.7%\n25.4%\n38.6%\n27.8%\nData source: VanEck Semiconductor ETF Fact Sheet.\nAs a word of caution, I wouldn't suggest getting too enamored by the one-year return. Remember, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are each near record levels, and technology companies have a lot to do with that. As such, Nvidia and many of its cohorts have enjoyed outsize buying activity over the last year.\nHowever, both the five-year and 10-year returns may catch your eye. Not only are these impressive returns, but they trounce the long-run average return of the S&P 500, which sits around 6.5% when accounting for inflation.\nIn a way, this makes sense. The S&P 500 is a much broader basket of companies than the VanEck Semiconductor ETF, which only concentrates on a relatively small cohort. Moreover, the S&P 500 is also exposed to many more end markets compared to the VanEck Semiconductor ETF.\nOn one side of the equation, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF boasts market-beating returns across a long-term horizon and provides investors with a high degree of diversification among semiconductor businesses.\nHowever, it's important to keep in mind that the semiconductor space is highly cyclical. This means demand trends can ebb and flow dramatically, which will impact these companies and the sentiment around them.\nWith that said, the fund's expense ratio of 0.35% is fairly reasonable. I think investors who are looking for broad exposure to the chip space and AI in general should consider the VanEck Semiconductor ETF. It's a good option for investors who are looking for opportunities outside of the most obvious plays, all at a reasonable price.\nBefore you buy stock in VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the most anticipated events of the year is officially over. Less than 24 hours ago, following the close of trading on Friday, June 7, the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), completed its 10-for-1 forward split.\nA \"stock split\" is an event which allows publicly traded companies to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. It's cosmetic in the sense that stock splits have no effect on a company's market cap or operating performance. Stock splits can make shares more nominally affordable for retail investors, as with a forward-stock split. They can also increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange, as seen with a reverse-stock split.\nInvestors have been gravitating to stock-split stocks over the last three years because they have a history of outperforming. More than a dozen high-flying stocks have announced and/or enacted forward-stock splits since the midpoint of 2021, including Nvidia, which just completed its second split since July 2021.\nOn paper, Nvidia has given investors every reason to hop aboard and enjoy the ride. On June 5, Nvidia's market cap topped $3 trillion for the first time, with the company surpassing Apple for the No. 2 spot among America's largest publicly traded companies. Since 2023 began, Nvidia has added roughly $2.68 trillion in market value, which has entirely been driven by AI.\nNvidia's AI-inspired graphics processing units (GPUs) are the cornerstone of high-compute data centers. Based on varied estimates, Nvidia's chips account for around 90% of AI-GPU market share, with the ultra-popular H100 GPU powering generative AI solutions and helping to train large language models.\nNvidia's innovative advantage is driving gains, too. The company's next-generation Blackwell chip, which costs between $30,000 to $40,000, is believed by some Wall Street analysts to be sold out well into 2025. With demand overwhelming supply, Nvidia has had no trouble raising the price of its AI-GPUs and reaping the rewards of a massive uptick in gross margin -- 78.35% in the fiscal first quarter of 2025, ended April 28.\nDespite Nvidia's stock gaining 738% in a little over 17 months, it still appears reasonably cheap on a fundamental basis. Although shares are currently trading at roughly 34 times forward-year earnings, Wall Street's consensus calls for an annualized earnings growth rate of 46.5% over the next five years.\nOn the surface, Nvidia looks perfect following its 10-for-1 stock split. But as an investor, I can't judge a book solely by its cover.\nTaking a step back, widening the lens, and allowing history to be my guide leads to a completely different investment view of Nvidia over the months and/or years to come. While there's no denying that it's been firing on all cylinders and handily surpassing even the loftiest expectations thrown its way by Wall Street analysts, there are a handful of reasons why I wouldn't touch Nvidia stock with a 10-foot pole in the wake of its 10-for-1 split.\nThe primary reason I want nothing to do with Nvidia has to do with the history of next-big-thing innovations.\nSince the advent of the internet roughly three decades ago, Wall Street has had no shortage of next-in-line trends that were expected to change the growth arc for corporate America. Some of these innovations include genome decoding, the rise of nanotechnology, business-to-business commerce, 3D printing, blockchain technology, the metaverse, and now, artificial intelligence.\nWhile some of these trends were successful over the long run, they all share one thing in common (save for AI): an early stage bubble-bursting event. Investors have consistently overestimated the adoption of new technologies and innovations for more than 30 years. Every game-changing innovation comes with immense promise and lofty analyst expectations. Unfortunately, every new innovation needs time to mature -- and artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception. If and when the AI bubble bursts, there isn't a company that's going to take it on the chin more than Nvidia.\nMind you, I have no clue when the AI bubble could burst. History has shown that stock valuations can remain extended for years before correcting. But eventually (key word!), we've witnessed every new innovation navigate its way through a bubble-popping event.\nWe're also beginning to see subtle \"warnings\" from Nvidia that the peak is here or nearby.\nIf you were to scour Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter operating results and conference call, you'd find nothing but positive commentary from its management team. However, the company's fiscal second-quarter gross margin guidance of 75.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, is the red flag I speak of.\nAfter increasing its gross margin by 13.8 percentage points in a year, a forecast decline of 235 to 335 basis points (78.35% to a range of 75% to 76%) might sound like a nothingburger. But it's noteworthy when you consider that external competitors are hitting the ground running with AI-GPUs of their own. Furthermore, Nvidia's top four customers, which account for roughly 40% of its sales, are internally developing AI-GPUs for their data centers.\nThis forecast decline in sequential quarterly gross margin would appear to signal that Nvidia's pricing power has peaked. If GPU scarcity wanes, Nvidia's pricing power will taper, too.\nThe third reason I want nothing to do with Nvidia following its now-complete 10-for-1 stock split is, once again, history -- but this time I'm talking about its valuation.\nAs I noted earlier, Nvidia is still relatively inexpensive, based on the price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG ratio). But on the basis of trailing 12-month (TTM) sales, Nvidia has reached a level of historic priciness that rivals only Amazon and Cisco Systems prior to the dot-com bubble bursting.\nIn late March 2000, Cisco Systems peaked at just shy of 39 times TTM sales. Meanwhile, Amazon topped 43 times TTM sales in January 1999 before falling off a cliff. Nvidia is currently sitting at a multiple of 38 times TTM sales.\nHistory may not repeat perfectly on Wall Street, but it does have a tendency to rhyme. For those reasons, I'm not touching this artificial intelligence titan with a 10-foot pole.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Now entering the stock split zone.\nNvidia (NVDA) is joining its megacap tech peers, becoming the fourth \"Magnificent Seven\" stock to split since 2022.\nThe chip giant\u2019s 10-for-1 stock split, which will start trading on Monday, follows significant price growth, with shares up 212% in the past year. That massive rally pushed Nvidia into the $3 trillion club alongside Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), becoming just the third US company ever to reach that milestone.\n\u201cA stock split is a vote of confidence from management that the stock will hold its value, as the stock [price] typically increases,\u201d S&P Dow Jones Indices senior analyst Howard Silverblatt said.\nWinthrop Capital chief investment officer Adam Coons expects the split to boost retail investor interest but cautioned that an influx of retail traders could trigger volatility for the stock.\n\u201cThey can be a little bit more quick and emotional with their buying and selling decisions, so that can lead to heightened volatility as you start to dilute the institutional buyers,\u201d Coons told Yahoo Finance.\nEvercore ISI's Julian Emanuel sees increased volatility as an opportunity to buy Nvidia \u2014 a stock he views as a \u201cgenerational opportunity\u201d and this era's \"marquee\" technology stock.\n\u201cWhile high profile splits have often fueled stock volatility \u2014 speculative buying and profit taking around the event \u2014 Thinning the trees within the forest post-split catalyzes the Buying Opportunity for the patient investor,\u201d Emanuel wrote in a client note.\nHistorically, stock splits are typically bullish for the companies that enact them, with average returns one year later of 25% versus about 12% for the broad market, according to analysis from Bank of America.\nNvidia\u2019s skyrocketing gains have driven the broader market to record highs. Its rally accounted for about a third of the S&P 500\u2019s return since the start of the year, and more than a quarter of the S&P 500\u2019s return in the month of May, according to Silverblatt.\nWall Street has gotten even more bullish on the stock since its earnings report on May 22. Last week, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya raised his price target to a Street high of $1,500.\n\u201cWe are at the start of what I think would be a decade-long conversion to accelerated computing \u2026 We think that the spending could be anywhere between $250 [billion] to $500 billion a year, and Nvidia is leading the charge,\u201d Arya told Yahoo Finance.\nNvidia\u2019s stock split not only signals management\u2019s confidence in the chip giant but also enthusiasm and optimism about the broader artificial intelligence industry's growth potential.\nAs Lam Research (LRCX) CFO Doug Bettinger explained to me at Bank of America\u2019s Global Technology conference earlier this week, we\u2019re still \u201cvery, very early\u201d in the AI investment cycle.\nThat next round of growth \u2014 or the second wave of AI \u2014 is expected to take hold as companies begin to integrate AI into their planning and enterprise spending.\n\u201cMore and more companies are adopting hybrid-cloud architectures, and with a focus on building modern applications, and starting their journey into enterprise AI,\u201d Nutanix (NTNX) CEO Rajiv Ramaswami told me.\nFor investors looking to add to their portfolios, Arya likes Broadcom (AVGO), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Micron (MU), and Arm (ARM) as winners of AI\u2019s continued wave. In a note to clients last month, Arya wrote that he sees increased requirements in computing, networking, and memory as a \u201cmultiyear growth driver\u201d for the group.\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Ives said that the AI \u201cparty\u201d is just getting started and the clock is showing \u201c9p.m. in a party going till 4 a.m. with the rest of the tech world now joining.\u201d Ives thinks spending on GPUs and data centers is the \u201conly game in town.\u201d Ives thinks the \u201cfirst wave\u201d of AI benefited major technology giants leading the AI race, with the second, third and fourth \u201cderivatives\u201d beginning to show trickle-down effects on other companies.\nIn a separate investing event, Ives recently predicted that the AI-led bull run can last for another two to three years, saying in a year from now investors will be looking at $3 trillion to $4 trillion market caps for major tech companies.\n\u201cThe tech bull market is just starting,\u201d Ives reportedly said.\nIn his latest note Ives highlighted several stocks which he believes can benefit from the AI revolution. In this article we take a detailed look at these stocks and discuss their AI-related growth catalysts and see whether or not they are sound long-term investments. With each stock we have mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\nDan Ives of Wedbush thinks the it\u2019s just \u201c9 PM\u201d in the \u201cAI party\u201d that\u2019s set to go until \u201c4 AM\u201d and it\u2019s all about Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0GPUs as the analyst thinks the \u201conly game in town for GPUs to run generative AI applications all go through Nvidia.\u201d\nUBS believes Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to benefit from the $331 billion market opportunity in the AI Enabling layer, thanks to its GPUs. In the Cloud segment of the Enabling layer, UBS thinks Nvidia Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) DGX offering makes the company a promising player. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) DGX Cloud is a supercomputing service that gives enterprises access to software and infrastructure required to train advanced models for generative AI. It\u2019s a combination of servers and workstations for optimizing deep learning applications through the use of general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU).\nOn the Intelligence and Application layer of the AI value chain, UBS sees no notable catalyst for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nNVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest product announcements and its plans revealed at the Computex 2024 show that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts like NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and think its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will start shipping H200 in the second half of this year. At its GTC conference NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed three accelerators \u2013 B200, GB200 and GB200 NVL72. All of these products provide growth catalysts for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares and justify its P/E multiple of 71, given NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth expectation of over 100% this year and 32% next year. Based on 2026 EPS estimate set by Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 35.74, which makes the stock\u2019s valuation attractive given the growth catalysts it has.\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA): NVDA shares were our top contributor in the quarter following blowout 4Q results and 1Q guidance driven by strong data center sales. The company reported quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion, up 265% year-over-year, and EPS in the quarter of $5.16, up 487% year-over-year and 12% ahead of expectations. Revenue guidance for 1Q of $24 billion was 8% above very high expectations. The artificial intelligence arms race kicked-off by ChatGPT and Alphabet\u2019s Bard, among others, has generated tremendous demand for Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphic processors.\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 12 Best AI Stocks Leading the \u2018Big Tech Race\u2019 to $4 Trillion According to a Famous Wall Street Analyst. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: I Just Doubled Down on Another Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock. Here's Why",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "First, let's address the elephant in the room: It's highly unlikely that investors, least of all me, are going to forget Nvidia. The company has forged a path years in the making and has become the gold standard for graphics processing units (GPUs) used to underpin artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, I am as bullish on the company and its future as I have ever been, and I continue to believe the company has a bright future.\nSo, why would I \"forget Nvidia\" and double down on another AI stock instead? It comes down to portfolio management. I began accumulating Nvidia shares more than six years ago and continued adding to my position until earlier this year. Nvidia stock has gained 800% since early last year (as of this writing) and more than 3,300% over the past five years.\nAs a result of the stock's parabolic move, Nvidia is now one of the dominant stocks in my portfolio. It has become a 10-bagger and now represents more than 12% of my total holdings. From here on out, I expect Nvidia to do the heavy lifting, and I don't need to add any more capital to a stock that already represents so much of my portfolio.\nFor investors looking for another stock with significant potential, I recommend taking a look at Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR). I've owned the stock for some time, but earlier this week, I more than doubled my position in this AI pioneer. Here's why.\nInvestors might not know that Palantir has a long history of developing AI and has been doing so long before the technology went viral last year. The company was founded more than 20 years ago with the idea that AI could help the U.S. intelligence community and our allies make better use of existing data.\nIntelligence agencies had reams of data but no way to extract the most useful and important tidbits. Palantir developed sophisticated algorithms and data mining solutions that could follow the trail of breadcrumbs left by aspiring terrorists and piece together details to form a picture that might otherwise be missed.\nPalantir serves a broad cross-section of the U.S. intelligence and law enforcement communities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and National Security Agency (NSA), but that's just the beginning. It also works with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), various branches of the U.S. military, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and many more.\nOnce Palantir had established itself with government agencies, it turned its attention to enterprise businesses, as its data mining and AI solutions were just as useful to corporations. This broad client base and range of experience give Palantir an AI pedigree that's hard to match.\nPalantir's vast experience in the field enabled it to pounce when advancements in generative AI burst onto the scene last year. The company was already providing data mining and analytics services to corporate customers, sifting through mounds of information and providing actionable intelligence.\nBeyond its existing services, Palantir quickly developed its artificial intelligence platform (AIP), which \"powers real-time, AI-driven decision-making.\" For example, AIP can scan through reams of sales data to prioritize customers most likely to buy. Another example provided by Palantir illustrates how AIP helps a manufacturer in the path of an oncoming hurricane decide which orders to speed up, cancel, or delay before the storm hits and the resulting financial impact of those decisions.\nA great many businesses would love to harness the power of AI but simply don't know where to start. For those companies, Palantir devised the AIP Bootcamp. \"These immersive, hands-on-keyboard sessions allow new and existing customers to build live alongside Palantir engineers, all working toward the common goal of deploying AI in operations,\" the company said.\nDemand has been off the charts, and the success of these workshops has been phenomenal, leading to huge contract wins. Chief Revenue Officer Ryan Taylor explained:\nAs one example, a leading utility company signed a seven-figure deal just five days after completing the boot camp. Another customer immediately signed a paid engagement after just one day of their multi-day boot camp and then converted to a seven-figure deal three weeks later.\nPalantir has seen a big uplift in its U.S. commercial revenue, which grew 70% and 40% year over year in the fourth and first quarters, respectively. The company can barely keep up with the surging demand for its boot camps, leading to more robust business results.\nAs I pointed out at the start, I still believe Nvidia has a long road ahead. That said, the opportunity represented by AI software is intriguing. The market is expected to grow from $1.49 billion in 2022 to $280 billion by 2032, or a total growth of 18,647%. Palantir is one of just a few companies with the resources and experience to tap into that opportunity right now\u00a0while the competition is left scrambling.\nPalantir recently delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of profitability. The most commonly used valuation metrics suggest the stock is overpriced at 212 times earnings and 25 times sales, but those metrics fail to take into account the company's impressive growth rate. When measured using the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, Palantir's multiple clocks in at less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.\nThese aren't just empty words. I put my money where my mouth is and doubled down on my position in Palantir Technologies. Because, in my book, it's a compelling opportunity.\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) overtook Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday as the most valuable company in the world just two weeks after it took the No. 2 spot from Apple (AAPL).\nNvidia's stock price rose about 3.5%, eclipsing $135 per share and giving the chipmaker a market capitalization over $3.33 trillion. With a 0.4% slide on Tuesday, Microsoft's market cap stood at nearly $3.32 trillion.\nShares of Nvidia are up more than 215% over the last 12 months and more than 3,400% over the last five years. Year to date, Nvidia has gained 175%; Microsoft stock is up just less than 19% in 2024.\nNvidia first crossed a $1 trillion market cap on June 13, 2023. The stock advanced north of $2 trillion on March 1, and then rapidly crossed the $3 trillion mark for the first time on June 5. The company's advance from a $1 trillion to a $3 trillion market cap was the fastest on record.\nNvidia's surge has made it a top weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), and the chipmaker has served a pivotal role in the benchmark index hitting record highs in 2024.\nUp until May, the S&P 500 had traded with a near-perfect correlation to Nvidia's price movement, meaning that as Nvidia's stock rose, so did the broader index. As of Monday, Nvidia's stock gains alone had contributed about one-third of the S&P 500's year-to-date rise, according to data from Citi's equity research team.\nNvidia completed a 10-for-1 split on June 10. \nThe company's rise comes amid the generative AI explosion that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT platform in late 2022.

        "Author": "  Christiaan Hetzner ",
        "Text": "Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang is beginning to learn the meaning of the expression, \u201cThe higher they rise, the harder the fall.\u201d\nAfter briefly eclipsing Microsoft and Apple in value last week\u2014and indeed\u00a0entire\u00a0European stock markets\u2014the company behind the AI chip boom has experienced the single fastest drawdown in history.\nOver the past three days, roughly $430 billion in Nvidia's market cap has been wiped out, which is the biggest three-day value loss for any company in history. If you measure the drop from its intraday peak on Thursday, more than half-a-trillion dollars have gone up in smoke. That\u2019s almost the entire value of Tesla knocked off its shares, which pose larger problems for the overall stock market.\n\u201cIf Nvidia corrects pretty hard in the coming months, it becomes very difficult for the [S&P 500] to keep rising,\u201d Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel Financial, told the Financial Times.\nIt hasn\u2019t helped either that the founder and CEO has inadvertently added to the pressure by cashing out himself. Huang\u2019s Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which automatically executes sales when certain conditions are met, liquidated 720,000 shares worth\u00a0nearly $95 million\u00a0this month alone.\nThe timing is unfortunate coming just before Wednesday\u2019s annual shareholder meeting and two weeks after a 10-for-1 stock split that made it easier for retail investors to buy into the company. One indication many amateur traders might be taking profits in Nvidia is a sudden slump in Bitcoin, an asset highly correlated to the retail market since it is largely untouched by institutional investors.\nSpeaking with Yahoo Finance, Harvest Portfolio Management co-CIO Paul Meeks blamed the drop on profit taking and talk of AI data center spending peaking.\n\u201cThe key here is to make investors feel comfortable that there is a long runway yet,\u201d he\u00a0told\u00a0the program on Monday.\nWhile Meeks argued Nvidia still looked cheap compared with Cisco when it surged during the dotcom era on the back of internet infrastructure spending, Nvidia\u2019s stock chart suggested further pressure until the price settled around a support line like the 50-day moving average.\n\u201cSo [I\u2019m] comfortable with the fundamentals, not comfortable with the technicals,\u201d he said, adding that once the heavy selling volumes begin petering out, he\u2019s \u201cinclined to go back in\u201d and add to his large position in the share.\nThe company has not responded to a request by Fortune for comment.\nNvidia\u2019s bleeding-edge H100 chips are specially designed for data centers that train neural networks, including the large language models like GPT-4 and other forms of generative AI. One of its\u00a0most prolific buyers\u00a0is Elon Musk, who is ordering more chips than he claims his\u00a0company Tesla\u00a0can even install\u00a0just to ensure he gets his hands on them faster than any of his tech competitors.\nIts best-known customer, however, remains OpenAI, whose ChatGPT creation in November 2022 launched the GenAI gold rush. In April Huang took the rare step of hand delivering a personally signed DGX server to the company, one that came equipped with the first H200 training chips offering nearly twice the GPU memory of its predecessor.\nNvidia\u2019s position as the undisputed global leader\u2014whose AI training chips are a matter\u00a0of U.S. national security\u2014has spawned a rally in its stock price that can only be compared with Tesla\u2019s 2020 pile-on.\nOn Monday, Deutsche Bank illustrated the historic nature of Nvidia\u2019s surge by publishing a chart that compared its market cap to Warren Buffett\u2019s investment holding. \u201cBerkshire Hathaway has taken over a century to go from zero to just under $1 trillion,\u201d it wrote. \u201cIt took 30 days for Nvidia to go from $2 trillion to a $3 trillion market cap.\u201d\nPart of this insane volatility stems from the challenge of properly valuing the trajectory of future revenue, earnings, and cash flow when the company\u2019s fundamentals are all improving at a speed no one had anticipated, Nvidia included.\nFor now, the share is expected to see a rebound when trading on Tuesday opens, but more short-term pain could in store for Nvidia bulls as Meeks suggested. Another adage well known on Wall Street is, \u201cThe trend is your friend.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Is Nvidia Stock Actually Undervalued?",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "A price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of nearly 74 will usually be considered a nosebleed valuation for any stock. To put that multiple into perspective, it's nearly three times the P/E ratio for the S&P 500.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) currently trades at nearly 74 times trailing-12-month earnings. Unsurprisingly, many investors think the chip stock is priced at a steep premium. But could they be wrong? Is Nvidia stock actually undervalued?\nLet's first define the term \"undervalued.\" Oxford Languages, the world's top dictionary publisher, defines it as \"not valued or appreciated highly enough\" or \"having an underestimated financial value.\"\nI'd argue that any rational investor who owns Nvidia shares thinks the stock is undervalued based on that definition. Why? It wouldn't make any sense to hold onto the stock if they didn't think it was already valued and appreciated enough or had a financial value that was higher than it should be.\nOf course, not everyone will agree with these investors. However, that's how the stock market works. Buyers of a stock think a stock has more room to run (i.e., it's not valued highly enough). Sellers usually don't. Valuation, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder.\nOf the 36 analysts surveyed by LSEG in June, 21 rated Nvidia as a buy or a strong buy. Many on Wall Street seem to view the stock as undervalued. How can they hold such an optimistic opinion in light of Nvidia's sky-high P/E ratio? That's easy: They think the company's growth more than justifies its current price tag.\nThat raises the next question: How much growth does Nvidia need to deliver to be undervalued now? There are several ways to determine an answer.\nOne quick-and-dirty approach is to use the price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio. This ratio is calculated by dividing the P/E ratio by the expected annual-earnings per share (EPS) growth rate -- typically the projected growth over the next five years. Any PEG ratio of below 1 is considered an attractive valuation.\nThe math is simple using the PEG ratio. Since Nvidia's P/E ratio is nearly 74, the company would need to generate annual EPS growth of roughly 74% over the next five years to be undervalued today. Some investors could believe this lofty growth rate is quite possible. After all, Nvidia's EPS skyrocketed 629% year over year in the first quarter of 2024. Its growth could slow dramatically and still be above 74%.\nAnother more involved approach is to perform a discounted cash flow analysis. This method helps investors determine the present value of a stock using expected future cash flows. Aswath Damodaran, the NYU finance professor known as the \"Dean of Valuation,\" built a discounted cash flow model showing Nvidia's revenue could increase at a compounded annual growth rate of 32.2% and still be more than 80% overvalued.\nWill Nvidia deliver enough revenue and earnings growth over the next five years for the stock to be truly undervalued right now? Maybe, but several things could get in the way. The current rush to develop generative AI apps could slow. Rivals could introduce new chips that eat into Nvidia's market share.\nWall Street projects Nvidia's earnings will grow by around 43.2% annually over the next five years, according to LSEG. That's an astounding growth rate, but it isn't enough to bring Nvidia's PEG ratio below 1.\nI don't believe Nvidia stock is undervalued using conventional valuation models. However, that doesn't mean its momentum won't continue. All that's required is that enough investors think Nvidia stock has room to run and keep buying it hand over fist. As I stated earlier, valuation is in the eyes of the beholder. Many investors behold Nvidia as undervalued and could continue to do so.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "As Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock dips under $120, wide-eyed investors are starting to realize that this stock actually goes down sometimes. It\u2019s a stunning development because chasing the stock higher has been a profitable strategy for a long. Yet, some stock traders will learn that Nvidia isn\u2019t invincible. Sure, it\u2019s still a highly profitable company, but I am neutral on NVDA stock until the share price pulls back more.\nNvidia designs powerful processors that can be used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The company is a darling of the stock market, and as we\u2019ll discuss soon, analysts are generally enamored with Nvidia.\nYet, there\u2019s actually a Wall Street expert who dares to assign a negative rating to Nvidia stock (we\u2019ll get to that topic in a moment). I won\u2019t go full-on bearish, as I\u2019m neutral and only want to see Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization and valuation come down somewhat. To me, it\u2019s a case of \u201cright company, right stock, wrong price.\u201d\nIn case Nvidia wasn\u2019t already world-dominating, the company is reportedly making a big move in the Middle East soon. There, Nvidia has agreed to deploy its AI technology in data centers owned by Qatar-based telecom firm Ooredoo.\nMore specifically, Ooredoo\u2019s data centers in Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait, and the Maldives will have access to robust AI and graphics-processing technology, courtesy of Nvidia. Currently, the financial details of the Nvidia-Ooredoo agreement are unknown.\nThis agreement comes at a politically contentious time, to say the least. The U.S. government might not be too happy about the Nvidia-Ooredoo deal due to concerns that Middle Eastern countries could potentially provide an avenue for China to get high-powered AI processors.\nThe U.S. can place restrictions on its exports of sophisticated AI chips to China, but it can\u2019t control what every company does in every country. So, it will be interesting to see if there are any repercussions from the arrangement between Nvidia and Ooredoo. For the time being, though, it\u2019s probably reasonable to conclude that Nvidia will plant its proverbial flag in the Middle East and thereby gain access to new revenue streams.\nTo be fair and balanced, I started off with a piece of good news for Nvidia\u2019s shareholders. However, not everyone is straight-up bullish about Nvidia stock. There\u2019s a true contrarian voice out there on Wall Street, as investor and blogger Johnny Zhang actually went so far as to assign NVDA shares a Strong Sell rating.\nIs it even legal to do this in 2024? Zhang may be guilty of stock-market blasphemy, as Nvidia is viewed as an unassailable and invulnerable juggernaut of the white-hot AI hardware market.\nOn the other hand, I tend to concur with Zhang\u2019s reasons for leaning bearish on Nvidia stock. The market\u2019s expectations about Nvidia\u2019s future growth may be \u201coverly optimistic, with potential risks including pull-forward demand, competition, and geopolitical tensions,\u201d Zhang explained.\nNvidia doesn\u2019t currently have much \u201ccompetition\u201d in the niche market for AI-compatible graphics processing units (GPUs), but it\u2019s hard for one company to be the king of the hill. In such a lucrative industry, it shouldn\u2019t be too surprising if rival upstarts come out of the woodwork, and they might not all be from the U.S.\nStill, for the time being, investors probably don\u2019t need to be overly concerned about Nvidia facing stiff competition. Rather, it\u2019s the company\u2019s valuation and the overwhelmingly enthusiastic market sentiment that ought to concern the Nvidia perma-bulls.\nOn that topic, a quote from Zhang really resonated with me. \u201cKeep in mind\u2026 the Wall Street touts always encourage you to be most bullish on stocks when they are hot or portrayed as the next big thing in the future,\u201d he warned.\nThat quote is worth writing down and remembering. Now, Nvidia stock is showing signs of exhaustion, but it still trades at 65.6x trailing 12-month earnings (based on total earnings of $1.80 during the past four quarters). Meanwhile, the sector median P/E ratio is 23.5x.\nOn TipRanks, NVDA comes in as a Strong Buy based on 38 Buys and three Hold ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Nvidia stock price target is $156.35, implying 32.4% upside potential.\nIf you\u2019re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell NVDA stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Matt Ramsay of TD Cowen, with an average return of 126.86% per rating and a 94% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\nNvidia is a niche-market juggernaut, and there\u2019s no point in trying to deny this. At the same time, I agree with Zhang that the market may be \u201coverly optimistic\u201d regarding Nvidia\u2019s future growth assumptions.\nMany analysts still like Nvidia a lot, and I don\u2019t blame them. As I see it, investing in Nvidia could make a lot of sense, but not at the current share price. Therefore, I am neutral on NVDA stock and would want to see it pull back 20% or even 25% before considering taking a share position.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 It all started at a Denny\u2019s in San Jose in 1993.\nThree engineers \u2014 Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem \u2014 gathered at the diner in what is now the heart of Silicon Valley to discuss building a computer chip that would make graphics for video games faster and more realistic. That conversation, and the ones that followed, led to the founding of Nvidia, the tech company that soared through the ranks of the stock market to briefly top Microsoft as the most valuable company in the S&P 500 this week.\nThe company is now worth over $3.2 trillion, with its dominance as a chipmaker cementing Nvidia\u2019s place as the poster child of the artificial intelligence boom \u2014 a moment that Huang, Nvidia\u2019s CEO, has dubbed \u201cthe next industrial revolution.\u201d\nOn a conference call with analysts last month, Huang predicted that the companies using Nvidia chips would build a new type of data center called \u201cAI factories.\u201d\nHuang added that training AI models is becoming a faster process as they learn to become \u201cmultimodal\u201d \u2014 able to understand text, speech, images, video and 3-D data \u2014 and also \u201cto reason and plan.\u201d\n\u201cPeople kind of talk about AI as if Jensen just kind of arrived like in the last 18 months, like 24 months ago all of a sudden figured this out,\u201d said Daniel Newman, CEO of The Futurum Group, a tech research firm. \u201cBut if you actually go back in time and listen to Jensen talking about accelerated computing, he\u2019s been sharing his vision for more than a decade.\u201d\nThe Santa Clara, California-based tech company\u2019s invention of the graphics processor unit, or GPU, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. Now Nvidia\u2019s specialized chips are key components that help power different forms of artificial intelligence, including the latest generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.\nNvidia\u2019s GPUs are a key factor in the company\u2019s success in artificial intelligence, Newman added.\n\u201cThey took an architecture that was used for a single thing, to maybe enhance gaming, and they figured out how to network these things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe GPU became the most compelling architecture for AI, going from gaming, rendering graphics and stuff, to actually using it for data. ... They basically ended up creating a market that didn\u2019t exist, which was GPUs for AI, or GPUs for machine learning.\u201d\nAI chips are designed to perform artificial intelligence tasks faster and more efficiently. While general-purpose chips like CPUs can also be used for simpler AI tasks, they\u2019re \u201cbecoming less and less useful as AI advances,\u201d a 2020 report from Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology found.\nTech giants are snapping up Nvidia chips as they wade deeper into AI \u2014 a movement that\u2019s enabling cars to drive by themselves, and generating stories, art and music.\n\u201cJensen basically has made AI digestible and then Apple will make it consumable,\u201d Newman said.\nThe company carved out an early lead in the hardware and software needed to tailor its technology to AI applications, partly because Huang nudged it into what was still a nascent technology more than a decade ago.\n\u201cNvidia has been working on different portions of this problem for more than two decades now. They have a deep innovation engine that goes all the way back to the early 2000s,\u201d said Chirag Dekate, a VP analyst at Gartner, a tech research and consulting firm. \u201cWhat Nvidia did two decades ago is they both identified and they nurtured an adjacent market where they discovered that the same processors, same GPUs that they were using for graphics could be shaped to solve highly parallel tasks.\u201d\nAt the time, he said, AI was only in its infancy. But Nvidia\u2019s understanding that GPUs would be central to the development of AI was \u201cthe fundamental breakthrough that was needed,\u201d Dekate said.\n\u201cUntil then, we would have been, I would say, in the analytic Dark Ages,\u201d he said. \u201cThe analytics were there, but we could never bring these AI elements to life.\u201d\nAnalysts estimate that Nvidia\u2019s revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025 will reach $119.9 billion \u2014 about double its revenue for fiscal 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.\n\u201cMy hypothesis is the kind of exponential growth that we\u2019re seeing with Nvidia today is potentially a pattern that we\u2019re going to see replicated more frequently in the decades to come,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the Golden Age if you will...this is the best time to be an AI engineer.\u201d\n"

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    and  Josh Schafer    ",
        "Text": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) began trading Monday on a new 10-for-1 split basis, revising the shares' Friday closing price of $1,208.88 to $120.88. The stock closed up nearly 1% in its first day following the split.\nThe split means that owners of Nvidia common stock held as of the close of market on Thursday received 10 shares for each one share they held. For example, if a shareholder owned four shares of Nvidia as of Thursday, they now own 40 shares post-split.\nStock splits make owning shares of a stock more affordable by lowering the price of individual shares without diluting the value of existing shareholders' total holdings.\n\"The stock split is going to make Nvidia a lot more reachable for a lot of these retail traders,\" Option Research & Technology Services' Matt Amberson told Yahoo Finance last Thursday. \"Now, you rarely see a stock over $1,000 with a 50% implied volatility, so the prices of the options are extraordinarily high, so options traders are really looking forward to the split.\"\nNvidia's split comes after the company's total market valuation briefly eclipsed $3 trillion on Wednesday, pushing the chip firm past Apple to become the second-most-valuable publicly traded US company.\nShares of Nvidia have skyrocketed thanks to the explosion in interest in generative AI that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT software in late 2022. Since then, hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have been battling to get their hands on Nvidia's hardware to power their own generative AI platforms.\nThat sent Nvidia's revenue through the roof. In the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\nNvidia's Data Center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion.\nAnd Nvidia continues to develop new hardware to keep customers coming back for more. On June 3, CEO Jensen Huang announced an upgraded version of its Blackwell AI platform, called Blackwell Ultra, is coming in 2025 as well as an entirely new platform called Rubin set for 2026. And in 2027, the company will release an Ultra version of the Rubin hardware.\nStock splits are viewed by investors as a sign of strength, and consequently, companies that split their stock typically outperform the S&P 500 in the year following their announcement.\nOn average, stocks rise 25% in the 12 months following the announcement of their split compared to an average return of 12% from the S&P 500 in the same time frame, per analysis from Bank of America. This has been true \"across market regimes,\" BofA investment and ETF strategist Jared Woodard wrote in a note to clients.\nNotably, the trend includes the time period from 2000 to 2009, amid the unwinding of the tech bubble. Nvidia shares are up about 27% since the company announced its split on May 22.\nNvidia's stock split comes as AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are giving chase, announcing their own AI hardware and laying out their future product roadmaps as alternatives to Nvidia's. Nvidia's customers are also developing their own AI chips to train and run AI models to help mitigate the cost of purchasing new Nvidia products.\nIt's not just hyperscalers, though. Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and a slew of other major tech and automotive companies are angling to grab Nvidia's chips to train and deploy AI models for everything from recommendation engines to autonomous driving software.\nWhat's more, Nvidia says it has a growing total addressable market beyond tech companies, including government organizations, research institutions, and more, meaning it might have a lot more runway to go.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Title": "Here's Why Nvidia Is Still My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have skyrocketed in recent times, climbing 130% this year and more than 600% over the past three years. All of this is due to Nvidia's shift from a company serving primarily the video game industry to one that's critical to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) platforms.\nThe tech giant makes graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that traditionally have powered the speed and special effects involved in gaming -- and today these chips also are powering crucial AI tasks such as the training and inferencing of AI models. This has helped Nvidia's earnings to soar in the triple digits in recent quarters.\nSome investors worry about buying Nvidia stock today, though, considering its major gains -- and the fact that rivals are attempting to grab market share. But I think there's still plenty of room for Nvidia to advance from an earnings and a share performance perspective, and that's why it's still my top AI stock. Let's check out the details.\nFirst, we'll get started with a bit of background. It's important to understand why Nvidia is dominating the chip market. The company has the advantage of being first to market with its GPUs, but there's more to the picture than that. Nvidia's GPUs also happen to be the fastest, making them the gold standard for potential customers setting up an AI platform.\nAnd Nvidia didn't just stop at the GPU. The company offers a wide range of products and services, including an entire software platform for enterprises, that helps customers hit the ground running with their AI projects. Finally, Nvidia has made its wares available through all public cloud services, making it very easy for potential customers to access what Nvidia has to offer.\nNow, moving forward, I'm optimistic about Nvidia remaining ahead of the game, which will translate into more earnings growth and positive share price performance. There are two main reasons. The primary one has to do with Nvidia's focus on research and development. The company has set a goal of updating its GPUs on an annual basis, and if it meets that goal, it could very well always have the top-performing chip on the market.\nFor example, Intel recently said its new Gaudi 3 AI accelerator could outperform Nvidia's current top performer, the H100. However, Nvidia is in the process of launching an even more advanced chip, the H200, and later this year, Nvidia aims to release a whole new architecture called Blackwell, and its best-performing chip yet. This suggests that rivals may catch up with Nvidia's current top performer, but Nvidia likely will have another even better product ready to hit the market shortly thereafter.\nSecond, right now, we're in the early stages of AI development, with the market set to grow beyond $1 trillion later this decade, according to analysts' forecasts. In this environment, Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang is working on leading this development. An example is Huang's championing of sovereign AI, or the ability of countries to use their own data and infrastructure to create AI -- an AI tailored to their needs.\nHuang spoke of the importance of this earlier in the year at the World Governments Summit in Dubai. And in Nvidia's recent earnings report, the company said it's beginning to generate revenue from sales of AI products and services for sovereign AI. It even predicts that its sovereign AI revenue -- from nothing last year -- may reach \"the high single-digit billions\" this year. So Nvidia is leading the way when it comes to finding new streams of AI revenue.\nNow let's talk about valuation, the point that may lead investors to turn to a cheaper rival like Intel. Nvidia trades for 42 times forward earnings estimates, while Intel trades for only 27. Intel is a solid deal at these levels, and I would buy the stock for its potential to gain some AI market share and excel in its plans to open its chip manufacturing up to others.\nBut my top AI stock to own over time still is Nvidia for the reasons I've mentioned above, and these reasons make the stock well worth today's price. Yes, Nvidia has soared in recent years, but that doesn't mean the opportunity for gains is over -- if companies continue to develop AI projects as rapidly as in the recent past, Nvidia, and its investors, should continue to reap the rewards over time.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Title": "Nvidia Just Passed Microsoft as the Most Valuable Company in the World. Is it Too Late to Invest?",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) recent stock split lowered the price of each individual share after the high-flying stock reached beyond $1,000 and ever since that split a little more than a week ago, the shares have advanced about 12%. This momentum has helped the chip designer reach an enormous milestone. Nvidia just passed Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company with a market value topping $3.33 trillion as of market close on Tuesday -- that's compared to the rival software giant's $3.31 trillion market capitalization.\nThere's been a good reason for Nvidia's standout performance in recent times: its dominance in the billion-dollar artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. The company holds an 80% share\u00a0and this has helped earnings -- and clearly share price -- to soar. After the enormous gain, and as Nvidia steps ahead of Microsoft, the question now is: Is it too late to invest in this AI chip giant? Let's find out.\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) once were best known for powering video games and this helped Nvidia remain financially successful over time. But the AI boom marked a turning point for the company as potential customers realized how particularly well-suited Nvidia's GPUs were to crucial AI tasks. This is thanks to the GPU's ability to process many jobs simultaneously, making this chip ideal for things like the training and inferencing of AI models.\nBut Nvidia hasn't stopped with the GPU and instead created a broad range of products and services -- such as enterprise software -- to support AI customers along the development path. And this has resulted in triple-digit increases in revenue and profit in recent quarters. For example, in the past quarter, Nvidia's revenue reached a new record high of $26 billion -- and revenue linked to AI customers made up a whopping 86% percent of that.\nAs mentioned above, all of this boosted the stock price and prompted Nvidia to announce a 10-for-1 stock split. The goal? To bring the stock to a level that would make it easier for employees and investors to access it. From the announcement in late May to the actual operation earlier this month, Nvidia shares climbed nearly 30%, and they've continued to add to gains.\nNow, let's return to our question. Since Nvidia has climbed to a value above technology powerhouse Microsoft's, is it too late to get in on the stock? A look at valuation shows us that Nvidia is considerably more expensive than it was only a month ago. Today, the stock trades for more than 51x forward earnings estimates compared with about 30 in May.\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nSo does this mean you should hold off on buying this skyrocketing stock? Not necessarily. Yes, Nvidia is more expensive than it was a few weeks ago, but the stock is worth the premium for two reasons: its current leadership in the high-growth AI chip market, and most importantly, the steps it's taking to remain in that position.\nNvidia has committed to updating its GPUs annually, recently saying that after the launch of its new Blackwell architecture and chip later this year, \"other Blackwells\" will follow. This means that even if rivals release new chips, Nvidia, already in the lead, should remain ahead in terms of product performance.\nOn top of this, it's important to remember two other things. First, Nvidia already has secured its reputation as an expert in the AI chip market, and demand for its products and services is surpassing supply -- so it's already in a position of strength. And the innovation I just mentioned could keep this going. Second, the AI growth story is in its early days, with today's $200 billion AI market expected to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. As a result, Nvidia's AI growth may have a lot farther to go.\nAll of this means that today, even with Nvidia soaring past Microsoft, the investment opportunity is far from over -- and Nvidia still is a top stock to buy and hold for the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Eva Roytburg ",
        "Text": "Most of the world\u2019s top corporations have simple names. Steve Jobs named Apple while on a fruitarian diet, and found the name \"fun, spirited and not intimidating.\" Plus, it came before Atari in the phonebook. Microsoft is an amalgamation of the words \u201cmicrocomputer\u201d and \u201csoftware,\u201d while Walmart a combination of the last name of the superstore\u2019s founder, Sam Walton, and \u201cmart.\u201d\nNvidia\u2014which briefly held the title of the most valuable company in the world this past week\u2014challenges these simple branding conventions. The consonant-ridden name and eerie, 1990s-esque op-art logo recall its underdog, start-up roots rather than its current reality: a behemoth cornering the AI chips market.\nRegardless of its unconventionality, Nvidia\u2019s prominence demands conversation, and conversation demands pronunciation. So, what is the correct way to pronounce Nvidia?\nAccording to its website, Nvidia is pronounced \u201cen-VID-eeyah,\u201d not NUH-vid-eeyah, as many have called it.\nWhere did the 'Nvidia' name come from?\u00a0\nWhen Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang started the company with his friends Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in 1993, they hashed out almost every detail of their new business, except for the name. Sitting in a Palo Alto Denny\u2019s\u2014a venue chosen for its cheap coffee and for Huang\u2019s experience working there in his youth\u2014the three cofounders drew blanks for the title of their venture.\nSo, as they continued building, they simply named their files \u201cNV\u201d for next version, Huang previously told Fortune. When time came to incorporate the company, the three were forced to find a name. At first, they chose NVision, until they learned that a toilet paper manufacturer already took the name.\nAfter going back to the drawing board, the cofounders scraped through all words with \u201cNV\u201d in them, until Huang suggested Nvidia, riffing on the Latin word invidia, meaning \u201cenvy.\u201d\nThe name worked because the three had hopes to design such a powerful graphics chip that it would make competitors, as Priem previously told The New Yorker, \u201cgreen with envy.\u201d\nThe First 'Nvidia'\nThe first \u201cNvidia\u201d was Invidia, the Roman goddess of envy. Her heart was \u201cgreen with bile,\u201d her tongue dripped poison, she had a \u201cpallor smeared across her face, her entire body is gaunt, her eyesight squints at everything,\u201d as the Roman poet Ovid describes her in the Metamorphosis.\u00a0\nCompany branding doesn't ofter draw from Roman mythology, much less from a figure so unseemly. And yet, the envy motif appears to be littered throughout the company\u2019s products. The eighth generation of its graphics processing units had the slogan \u201cgreen with envy.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s logo, a green, spiraling eye, may have also drawn inspiration from the first Invidia. Her figure was associated with a piercing gaze, an \u201cevil eye\u201d that casts a curse upon those she envies. People of many religions still wear \u201cevil eye\u201d amulets, or recite prayers, to ward off the curse.\nMany companies now have reason to be jealous of Nvidia. With a market cap of $3.1 trillion, unprecedented market concentration and seemingly limitless growth, Nvidia\u2019s success is what every CEO dreams of.\nHuang may have foreseen this, and intentionally placed envy at the forefront as a reminder of his competitors clawing at him. According to The New Yorker, for years Huang opened every staff meeting with the words, \u201cour company is 30 days from going out of business.\u201d\nApparently, even after all the success, the phrase remains the unofficial corporate motto.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Rob Wile ",
        "Text": "The business world is increasingly banking on artificial intelligence to be the next big thing, and has found itself turning to one maker of computer chips in particular \u2014 Nvidia \u2014 to power the revolution.\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia's market capitalization hit $3 trillion, making it the second-largest publicly traded U.S. company, surpassing Apple and trailing only Microsoft.\nOver the past 12 months, Nvidia shares have climbed nearly 200%.\nWhat makes Nvidia so special?\nFounded in 1993 \u2014 famously, over a meal at Denny's \u2014 Nvidia  designs a special kind of programmable computer chip.\nFor decades, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices had dominated the U.S. chip sector.\nBut those companies specialized in producing CPUs \u2014 central processing units, which serve as the foundation for basic computing and software processes.\nNvidia, meanwhile, specialized in graphics processing units (GPUs). As their name suggests, GPUs are better able to render images, which meant that they were first associated with video and computer games.\nBut it turns out GPUs are also able to perform calculations concurrently in a way that regular CPUs cannot \u2014 making them more energy efficient and better able to handle sophisticated computing demands.\nOver time, the other big chip makers began manufacturing their own GPUs to compete \u2014 but Nvidia, having enjoyed a first-mover advantage in the space, was where companies began to turn to for GPU needs.\nIt combined its chips with a suite of accompanying software that programmers simply preferred. Plus, its supply chain allowed it to produce GPUs in larger volumes, faster, and more reliably, than its rivals.\nFor instance, auto companies began turning to Nvidia chips for use in driver-assistance software that must process image information from sensors.\nNvidia hardware is now found in all Tesla vehicles.\nStill, until 2020, Intel was a larger company by market capitalization than Nvidia.\nPandemic surge turns into AI revolution\nDuring the pandemic, the shift to remote work and subsequent demand for data centers that could enable cloud-based computing \u2014 plus even more interest in video games while everyone was stuck indoors \u2014 accelerated Nvidia\u2019s revenues even further.\nThen Silicon Valley, led by OpenAI, began to realize the potential of artificial intelligence to transform how all companies do business.\nThe Nvidia ecosystem, from its software to its sourcing of materials, allowed it to position itself as the go-to source for companies that needed massive computing power to handle their AI needs.\nNvidia's fortunes have since gone stratospheric: Today, it is worth nearly $3 trillion according to its current stock price \u2014 nearly as much as Apple.\nCompany co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged in an interview with CNBC last year that a combination of luck and skill has led to the company\u2019s success.\n\u201cWe just believed that someday something new would happen, and the rest of it requires some serendipity,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t foresight. The foresight was accelerated computing.\u201d\nToday, virtually every major tech company, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle, has made use of Nvidia chips.\nBloomberg News has called Nvidia\u2019s chips the \u201cworkhorse for training AI models,\u201d and PNC Financial Services Group analyst Amanda Agati described Nvidia\u2019s lead in the category last fall, based on its valuation, as a \u201cquasi monopoly.\u201d\nFor Moody\u2019s Senior Vice President Raj Joshi, Nvidia represents the \u201cdominant\u201d infrastructure player behind the current rise of the AI sector.\nWhile other chip designers continue to work to catch up to Nvidia, the company\u2019s three decades\u2019 worth of GPU specialization \u2014 represents a massive advantage, he said.\n\u201cThis emerging field [AI] is better supported by GPUs,\u201d Joshi said in an interview with NBC News, adding: \u201cNvidia is providing the foundation for it in most cases.\u201d\nNvidia also offers solutions for other sectors, like health care, that are not specifically tech-oriented, Joshi said.\n\u201cThey have a big lead in these markets,\u201d he said.\nNvidia\u2019s specialization means it is able to charge a premium for its products. In fact, its chips, which are manufactured in Taiwan, are so unique that companies looking to build AI capabilities are complaining that there is a shortage of them.\nWhile the Biden administration\u2019s 2022 CHIPS and Science Act is designed to spur development of GPUs \u2014 and do so on U.S. shores \u2014 there is already concern about keeping up with market forces.\n\u201cThe volume of chips that [AI companies] project they need is mind-boggling,\u201d U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said this week. She suggested even more federal subsidies would be needed if the U.S. hoped to be a meaningful player in chip manufacturing.\n\u201cI suspect there will have to be \u2014 whether you call it \u2018CHIPS Two\u2019 or something else \u2014 continued investment if we want to lead the world,\u201d Raimondo said during a virtual appearance at an Intel event. \u201cWe fell pretty far. We took our eye off the ball.\u201d\nIn the meantime, investor interest in Nvidia remains frenzied. While some have speculated that its success could be a bubble, many Wall Street analysts say its financial statements have been proof that its product is viable.\n\u201cThe health of their core data center business is genuinely stunning,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 Tony Pasquariello wrote in a note to clients Friday.\nBecause it is now so much more valuable, Nvidia\u2019s financial results carry greater weight for major stock indices, acording to Agati, who is chief investment officer and managing executive for investments at PNC.\nIn other words as Nvidia goes, so goes the stock market.\n\u201c[Nvidia] has become critical to the market\u2019s path forward,\u201d Agati said in an email to NBC News, adding: \u201cIn the saying \u2018data is the new oil,\u2019 Nvidia continues to prove it is in a league of its own.\u201d\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com\n"

        "Author": "  Jason Ma ",
        "Text": "AI chip leader Nvidia will have an embarrassment of riches in the coming years, and shareholders will be rewarded, a tech analysts predicted.\nBen Reitzes, a managing director and head of technology research at Melius Research, told CNBC on Wednesday that Jensen Huang's Nvidia has mastered a \"full stack\" approach with its hardware and software, giving it a key advantage in AI.\n\"What they did is they built a computing language and an ecosystem that allows you to monetize AI, and obviously they're killing it,\" he said.\nReitzes has a price target of $160 on Nvidia stock, implying a 30% gain from Friday's closing price. Despite an ongoing selloff that began earlier this month, shares have soared 150% so far this year after more than tripling in 2023. Among the Magnificent 7 stocks that he covers, Nvidia has the most upside ahead, he added.\nAnother big advantage Nvidia has over rivals is its annual cadence of innovating new products, Reitzes said. That means developers and customers will know where Nvidia is headed and can budget for upgrades accordingly.\n\"And they're running 150 miles an hour while everyone else is running 100. It's going to be hard to catch these guys,\" he said.\nGiven Nvidia's edge in the booming AI space, Melius Research projects the company will generate $270 billion in cash over the next three years, potentially setting the stage for huge shareholder returns.\nManagement may not be eager to tout the possibility of stock buybacks as those are often associated with older companies, Reitzes said. But in his view, it's obvious.\n\"No one's talking about it, and when you do the model we do, it's a cash gusher,\" he said. \"And there's nothing they can do. This government's not going to let them buy anything big. They can't invest that much in R&D. It's just not possible. So we gotta get it as shareholders.\"\nTo be sure, Nvidia has been returning capital to shareholders. In August, it announced a $25 billion repurchase program. And last month, Nvidia boosted its quarterly cash dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10, equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis.\nNvidia declined to comment about the possibility of more stock buybacks.\nFor his part, Reitzes was quick to point out that any future buybacks wouldn't imply that Nvidia has stopped growing. \"It's not an insult to buy back stocks if you have nothing else to do.\"\nNvidia's recent financials show that its ability to generate cash is accelerating. In the fiscal year that ended in January, Nvidia's net cash provided by operating activities soared to $28.1 billion from $5.6 billion in the prior year.\nAnd in the first quarter that ended in April, net cash provided by operating activities was $15.3 billion\u2014already more than half of last year's total.\nMeanwhile, Huang told investors this past week that Nvidia will remain the gold standard for AI training chips amid concerns that rivals could cut into his market share.\nThe rollout of Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell system later this year will only cement that lead, he said at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.\n\u201cThe Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history,\u201d Huang said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "3 Reasons Super Micro Computer Could Outperform Nvidia This Year",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are two of the market's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Super Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, is a leading producer of dedicated AI servers. Nvidia is the world's largest producer of data center GPUs for processing AI tasks.\nIn 2023, Supermicro's stock rallied 246% as Nvidia's stock rose 239%. And since the start of 2024, Supermicro's stock has risen another 223% as Nvidia's stock has advanced 164%. Both stocks are still riding high on the buying frenzy in AI stocks, but I believe Supermicro will continue to perform Nvidia through the end of the year for three simple reasons.\nSupermicro's revenue and earnings rose 37% and 115%, respectively, in fiscal 2023 (which ended last June) as its sales of dedicated AI servers surged. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 110% and 102%, respectively, in fiscal 2024.\nBy comparison, Nvidia's revenue growth flatlined in fiscal 2023 (which ended in January 2023) as adjusted earnings fell 25%. Its sales of gaming graphics processing units (GPUs) declined as macro headwinds throttled its sales of data center chips and people started to adapt to the challenges introduced by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nBut in fiscal 2024, Nvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings surged 126% and 288%, respectively, as the explosive growth of the generative AI market lit a raging fire under its sales of data center GPUs and offset its slower sales of gaming GPUs. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 98% and 108%, respectively, in fiscal 2025.\nThose growth trajectories are similar, but analysts expect Supermicro to grow faster than Nvidia over the next three years. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, they expect Supermicro's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 58%. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, they expect Nvidia's revenue to rise by a CAGR of 44%.\nWe should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but Supermicro seems to have more room to grow than Nvidia. Supermicro currently only controls about 10% of the dedicated AI server market, but Bank of America expects its share to grow to 17% over the next three years as the entire market expands 150%.\nThat growth will be supported by its longtime partnership with Nvidia, which grants it access to the chipmaker's high-end data center GPUs before most of its bigger competitors. However, Supermicro has also been developing dedicated AI servers that use Advanced Micro Devices'\u00a0cheaper data center GPUs. That fledgling partnership could gradually reduce Supermicro's dependence on Nvidia. It would also ensure that its server sales keep rising -- even if AMD gains ground against Nvidia.\nNvidia already controls 88% of the discrete GPU market, according to JPR, and it generated 87% of its revenue from its data center GPUs in its latest quarter. Nvidia's core market of data center GPUs is still expanding, but it probably won't generate as much growth through market share gains as Supermicro in the future.\nSupermicro's stock has soared over the past few years, but it's still surprisingly cheap at 25 times forward earnings and 2 times its fiscal 2025 sales. Nvidia looks a lot pricier at 50 times forward earnings and 30 times its fiscal 2025 sales. Supermicro's market cap of $54 billion is also tiny compared to Nvidia's market cap of $3.3 trillion.\nSupermicro was only recently revalued from a traditional server maker to a high-growth AI stock, so it could have more room to run before it's considered overvalued. Nvidia, however, is starting to look expensive relative to other chip and AI stocks.\nI believe Supermicro will continue to outperform Nvidia through the end of the year, but both stocks are still great long-term plays for growth-oriented investors. I also think it's still smart to own both Supermicro and Nvidia -- since they operate different business models and focus on different parts of the booming AI market.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "It's impossible to ignore the effect artificial intelligence (AI) has had on the technology landscape over the past year or so, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the standard bearer. The company's chips are at the heart of the AI revolution, providing the computational horsepower that makes it all possible. This, in turn, has sent the stock soaring, up 215% over the past year. These gains led to Nvidia's high-profile 10-for-1 stock split, which was completed just last week.\nAfter the stock's epic run to a $3 trillion market cap, Wall Street is reevaluating Nvidia's future prospects. There's a new price target from one analyst that should be of particular interest to shareholders.\nRosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated his buy rating on Nvidia stock and increased his price to $200. That represents potential upside for investors of 53% compared to Monday's closing price, and would push Nvidia's market cap within striking distance of $5 trillion. One aspect of Nvidia's business that's being overlooked by investors is the software side. \"The real narrative lies in the software that complements all the hardware goodness,\" the analyst wrote.\nHe went on to suggest that demand for software will increase over the course of \"the next decade in terms of overall sales mix.\"\nI think the analyst hit the nail on the head. Nvidia's edge lies not only in the hardware but also in the associated software that helps provide peak performance. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest estimates that the total addressable market for AI software could be worth $13 trillion by 2030, helping illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity ahead.\nFurthermore, Nvidia will begin shipping its next-generation Blackwell processors later this year, which will cement the company's increasing lead in the AI chip space.\nNvidia's stock is currently selling for 51 times forward earnings. While that's a premium valuation, it's an attractive price for a stock that has generated gains of 27,450% over the past 10 years.\nThere's a long runway ahead, which is why Nvidia stock is a buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Project G-Assist, NVIDIA ACE NIMs for Digital Humans, and Generative AI Tools Deliver Advanced AI Experiences on RTX Laptops; Plus, RTX-Accelerated APIs for Small Language Models Coming to Windows Copilot Runtime\nNVIDIA RTX AI PC\nTAIPEI, Taiwan, June 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- COMPUTEX --\u00a0NVIDIA today announced new NVIDIA RTX\u2122 technology to power AI assistants and digital humans running on new GeForce RTX\u2122 AI laptops.\nNVIDIA unveiled Project G-Assist \u2014 an RTX-powered AI assistant technology demo that provides context-aware help for PC games and apps. The Project G-Assist tech demo debuted with ARK: Survival Ascended from Studio Wildcard. NVIDIA also introduced the first PC-based NVIDIA NIM\u2122 inference microservices for the NVIDIA ACE digital human platform.\nThese technologies are enabled by the NVIDIA RTX AI Toolkit, a new suite of tools and software development kits that aid developers in optimizing and deploying large generative AI models on Windows PCs. They join NVIDIA\u2019s full-stack RTX AI innovations accelerating over 500 PC applications and games and 200 laptop designs from manufacturers.\nIn addition, newly announced RTX AI PC laptops from ASUS and MSI feature up to GeForce RTX 4070 GPUs and power-efficient systems-on-a-chip with Windows 11 AI PC capabilities. These Windows 11 AI PCs will receive a free update to Copilot+ PC experiences when available.\n\u201cNVIDIA launched the era of AI PCs in 2018 with the release of RTX Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA DLSS,\u201d said Jason Paul, vice president of consumer AI at NVIDIA. \u201cNow, with Project G-Assist and NVIDIA ACE, we\u2019re unlocking the next generation of AI-powered experiences for over 100 million RTX AI PC users.\u201d\nProject G-Assist, a GeForce AI AssistantAI assistants are set to transform gaming and in-app experiences \u2014 from offering gaming strategies and analyzing multiplayer replays to assisting with complex creative workflows. Project G-Assist is a glimpse into this future.\nPC games offer vast universes to explore and intricate mechanics to master, which are challenging and time-consuming feats even for the most dedicated gamers. Project G-Assist aims to put game knowledge at players\u2019 fingertips using generative AI.\nProject G-Assist takes voice or text inputs from the player, along with contextual information from the game screen, and runs the data through AI vision models. These models enhance the contextual awareness and app-specific understanding of a large language model (LLM) linked to a game knowledge database, and then generate a tailored response delivered as text or speech.\nNVIDIA partnered with Studio Wildcard to demo the technology with ARK: Survival Ascended. Project G-Assist can help answer questions about creatures, items, lore, objectives, difficult bosses and more. Because Project G-Assist is context-aware, it personalizes its responses to the player\u2019s game session.\nIn addition, Project G-Assist can configure the player\u2019s gaming system for optimal performance and efficiency. It can provide insights into performance metrics, optimize graphics settings depending on the user\u2019s hardware, apply a safe overclock and even intelligently reduce power consumption while maintaining a performance target.\nFirst ACE PC NIM DebutsNVIDIA ACE technology for powering digital humans is now coming to RTX AI PCs and workstations with NVIDIA NIM \u2014 inference microservices that enable developers to reduce deployment times from weeks to minutes. ACE NIM microservices deliver high-quality inference running locally on devices for natural language understanding, speech synthesis, facial animation and more.\nAt COMPUTEX, the gaming debut of NVIDIA ACE NIM on the PC will be featured in the Covert Protocol tech demo, developed in collaboration with Inworld AI. It now showcases NVIDIA Audio2Face\u2122 and NVIDIA Riva automatic speech recognition running locally on devices.\nWindows Copilot Runtime to Add GPU Acceleration for Local PC SLMsMicrosoft and NVIDIA are collaborating to help developers bring new generative AI capabilities to their Windows native and web apps. This collaboration will provide application developers with easy application programming interface (API) access to GPU-accelerated small language models (SLMs) that enable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities that run on-device as part of Windows Copilot Runtime.\nSLMs provide tremendous possibilities for Windows developers, including content summarization, content generation and task automation. RAG capabilities augment SLMs by giving the AI models access to domain-specific information not well represented in \u200cbase models. RAG APIs enable developers to harness application-specific data sources and tune SLM behavior and capabilities to application needs.\nThese AI capabilities will be accelerated by NVIDIA RTX GPUs, as well as AI accelerators from other hardware vendors, providing end users with fast, responsive AI experiences across the breadth of the Windows ecosystem.\nThe API will be released in developer preview later this year.\n4x Faster, 3x Smaller Models With the RTX AI ToolkitThe AI ecosystem has built hundreds of thousands of open-source models for app developers to leverage, but most models are pretrained for general purposes and built to run in a data center.\nTo help developers build application-specific AI models that run on PCs, NVIDIA is introducing RTX AI Toolkit \u2014 a suite of tools and SDKs for model customization, optimization and deployment on RTX AI PCs. RTX AI Toolkit will be available later this month for broader developer access.\nDevelopers can customize a pretrained model with open-source QLoRa tools. Then, they can use the NVIDIA TensorRT\u2122 model optimizer to quantize models to consume up to 3x less RAM. NVIDIA TensorRT Cloud then optimizes the model for peak performance across the RTX GPU lineups. The result is up to 4x faster performance compared with the pretrained model.\nThe new\u00a0NVIDIA AI Inference Manager\u00a0SDK,\u00a0now available in early access, simplifies the deployment of ACE to PCs. It preconfigures the PC with the necessary AI models, engines and dependencies while orchestrating AI inference seamlessly across PCs and the cloud.\nSoftware partners such as Adobe, Blackmagic Design and Topaz are integrating components of the RTX AI Toolkit within their popular creative apps to accelerate AI performance on RTX PCs.\n\u201cAdobe and NVIDIA continue to collaborate to deliver breakthrough customer experiences across all creative workflows, from video to imaging, design, 3D and beyond,\u201d said Deepa Subramaniam, vice president of product marketing, Creative Cloud at Adobe. \u201cTensorRT 10.0 on RTX PCs delivers unprecedented performance and AI-powered capabilities for creators, designers and developers, unlocking new creative possibilities for content creation in industry-leading creative tools like Photoshop.\u201d\nComponents of the RTX AI Toolkit, such as TensorRT-LLM, are integrated in popular developer frameworks and applications for generative AI, including Automatic1111, ComfyUI, Jan.AI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Oobabooga and Sanctum.AI.\nAI for Content CreationNVIDIA is also integrating RTX AI acceleration into apps for creators, modders and video enthusiasts.\nLast year, NVIDIA introduced RTX acceleration using TensorRT for one of the most popular Stable Diffusion user interfaces, Automatic1111. Starting this week, RTX will also accelerate the highly popular ComfyUI, delivering up to a 60% improvement in performance over the currently shipping version, and 7x faster performance compared with the MacBook Pro M3 Max.\nNVIDIA RTX Remix is a modding platform for remastering classic DirectX 8 and DirectX 9 games with full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 and physically accurate materials. RTX Remix includes a runtime renderer and the RTX Remix Toolkit app, which facilitates the modding of game assets and materials.\nLast year, NVIDIA made RTX Remix Runtime open source, allowing modders to expand game compatibility and advance rendering capabilities.\nSince RTX Remix Toolkit launched earlier this year, 20,000 modders have used it to mod classic games, resulting in over 100 RTX remasters in development on the RTX Remix Showcase Discord.\nThis month, NVIDIA will make the RTX Remix Toolkit open source, allowing modders to streamline how assets are replaced and scenes are relit, increase supported file formats for RTX Remix\u2019s asset ingestor and bolster RTX Remix\u2019s AI Texture Tools with new models.\nIn addition, NVIDIA is making the capabilities of RTX Remix Toolkit accessible via a REST API, allowing modders to livelink RTX Remix to digital content creation tools such as Blender, modding tools such as Hammer and generative AI apps such as ComfyUI. NVIDIA is also providing an SDK for RTX Remix Runtime to allow modders to deploy RTX Remix\u2019s renderer into other applications and games beyond DirectX 8 and 9 classics.\nWith more of the RTX Remix platform being made open source, modders across the globe can build even more stunning RTX remasters.\nNVIDIA RTX Video, the popular AI-powered super-resolution feature supported in the Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox browsers, is now available as an SDK to all developers, helping them natively integrate AI for upscaling, sharpening, compression artifact reduction and high-dynamic range (HDR) conversion.\nComing soon to video editing software Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve and Wondershare Filmora, RTX Video will enable video editors to upscale lower-quality video files to 4K resolution, as well as convert standard dynamic range source files into HDR. In addition, the free media player VLC media will soon add RTX Video HDR to its existing super-resolution capability.\nLearn more about RTX AI PCs and technology by joining NVIDIA at COMPUTEX.\nAbout NVIDIANVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nFor further information, contact:Jordan DodgeNVIDIA Corporation+1-408-566-6792jdodge@nvidia.com\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance, and availability of our products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA RTX technology, GeForce RTX AI laptops, Project G-Assist, NVIDIA NIM inference microservices, NVIDIA ACE digital human platform, NVIDIA RTX AI Toolkit, GeForce RTX 4070 GPUs, RTX Tensor Core GPUs, DLSS, NVIDIA Audio2Face, NVIDIA Riva, NVIDIA TensorRT, NVIDIA AI Inference Manager, NVIDIA RTX Remix, NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, RTX Remix Runtime, and NVIDIA RTX Video; the benefits and impact of NVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with third parties, and the features and availability of their services and offerings; third parties using or adopting NVIDIA\u2019s products or technologies and the benefits thereof; RAG APIs enabling developers to harness application-specific data sources and tune SLM behavior and capabilities to application needs; and NVIDIA unlocking the next generation of AI-powered experiences for over 100 million RTX AI PC users, are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

        "Text": "Over the past 10 years, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the superchip manufacturer, has delivered remarkable returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 index.\nA mere $1,000 invested in Nvidia during this period has ballooned into a mountain of cash exceeding $255,000. In contrast, an equivalent investment in a broad-market exchange-traded fund (ETF), such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, would be worth a far more modest sum of around $3,300 today.\nHowever, Nvidia's meteoric rise has elevated its valuation to nosebleed levels. With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 47, the stock is richly priced compared with the S&P 500. After all, this benchmark index trades at around 21 times forward earnings.\nIn this context, Nvidia's stock may appear overly risky and due for a reversion to the mean. This way of thinking fails to capture Nvidia's radical value proposition and severely underestimates the revolutionary changes to society that are extremely close at hand.\nNvidia's significance extends beyond financial metrics. The company's first-class graphics processing units (GPUs) and parallel computing platform, CUDA, are pivotal in humanity's relentless pursuit of the \"technological singularity.\"\nCoined by John von Neumann in 1958, this concept describes when artificial intelligence (AI), fueled by machine learning algorithms, surpasses human cognitive abilities. It's the point where the boundary between humanity and computers blurs.\nWhile experts debate the exact timing of this event, there's broad consensus that it will indeed occur. Nvidia's GPUs, operating at unprecedented speeds, could accelerate the achievement of artificial general intelligence (AGI) within a matter of months from now.\nAGI represents an AI system capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across diverse tasks--a milestone that will reshape our world. This milestone is widely expected to unlock an \"intelligence explosion\", paving the way toward technological singularity.\nBeyond AGI lies artificial superintelligence (AST), where AI systems exceed human cognitive capabilities across all domains.\nWhat's critical to understand is that AST could arrive far sooner than expected. Some experts predict we'll witness this transformative leap by the decade's end, largely driven by Nvidia's Blackwell super-chips and CUDA software platform.\nNow, pessimists think this event is unlikely to occur before 2050, and others argue it is technically impossible for reasons beyond the scope of this article. But there's growing evidence that this bear thesis is more of a failure of imagination, rather than a clear-headed take on the events unfolding in front of our very eyes.\nFor investors, the essential insight is that Nvidia is pioneering new frontiers. Despite the stock's high valuation by traditional standards, Nvidia's recent progress suggests it might be time to reconsider conventional financial metrics.\nAt COMPUTEX 2024, CEO Jensen Huang's keynote address highlighted Nvidia's innovative Blackwell ecosystem and previewed transformative technologies like AI-driven manufacturing and advanced robotics.\nThis presentation supports the argument that Nvidia's current market valuation, close to $3 trillion, might not fully reflect its potential, perhaps by orders of magnitude.\nAlthough geopolitical tensions, like the hypothetical conflict between the U.S. and China over Taiwan and its semiconductor industry, could pose important risks, the invention of AGI, AST, and the technological singularity seems like a foregone conclusion at this advanced stage.\nMoreover, there is growing evidence that would-be competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are too far behind to challenge Nvidia's dominance in this exponentially growing industry seriously.\nNot only are switching costs enormously high, but Nvidia has lapped its competitors multiple times over the prior 10 years. There's no compelling reason to think this dynamic will change \u2013 even though some analysts have argued that companies may want to diversify the field to avoid over-reliance on one chip designer.\nNvidia, in short, seems poised to deliver extraordinary returns over the next five to 10 years as the AI revolution sallies forth at ludicrous speed.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock Is Still a Great Buy -- but When Should Investors Sell Shares?",
        "Author": "  Beth McKenna, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock story keeps getting better, thanks primarily to the incredible demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and related technology that enable artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. It's not too late to buy shares. Indeed, I just outlined 25 reasons to buy Nvidia stock now.\nBut there's a key question worth addressing that doesn't get much attention: When should you consider selling shares of Nvidia stock?\nThere are no \"right\" answers. Investors vary in terms of financial and personal factors. That said, below are three solid reasons for any investor to consider selling shares of Nvidia stock.\nInvestors should consider selling at least some of their Nvidia shares when Huang no longer leads the company he co-founded in 1993. He reportedly turned 61 earlier this year and seems to love his work, so barring any health issues, he could be at Nvidia's helm for a good number of years more. To say that Huang will be difficult to replace is an understatement.\nNvidia is many years ahead of the competition in AI-enabling technology thanks to Huang's foresight. Starting more than a decade ago, he began to steadily use profits from Nvidia's once-core computer gaming business to position the company to be in the catbird seat when the \"AI Age\" truly arrived. And arrive it did in late 2022, when generative AI made a big splash on the tech scene with OpenAI's release of its ChatGPT chatbot. Generative AI greatly expands the potential applications for AI.\nA more exact (but too long) subheading is the above plus the following tacked on: \"And if the company fails to develop whatever tech is knocking its GPUs from their lofty position.\"\nNvidia's GPUs are by far the favored chips for speeding up the training of AI models and the running of AI applications in data centers. Estimates vary, but it's widely projected that the company has more than a 90% share of the market for AI GPU chips for data centers, and more than an 80% share of the overall data center AI chip market.\nThis is a fantastic market to control. Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su projects that the global data center AI chip market will reach $400 billion in revenue by 2027, which would equate to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 72% from its estimated size of $45 billion in 2023.\nNvidia's data center business accounted for about 87% of its total revenue last quarter, and some greater (but unknown) percentage of its total profits. So, investors should consider selling shares if signs start pointing to the company's tech being displaced as the gold standard for enabling AI processing in data centers.\nHow will we know? What signs will there be?\nOther than staying abreast of the general space, there are two specific things investors can do. First, listen to Nvidia's quarterly earnings calls. Besides being interesting, Huang and CFO Colette Kress are very forthright. Recordings of these calls are posted on Nvidia's investor relations site, so you can listen at your leisure.\nSecond, monitor Nvidia's margins -- gross, operating, and profit, with special attention to gross margin. A company's margins will steadily decline when it's losing its competitive advantages. The key word is \"steadily.\" Occasional short-term declines or ups and downs aren't usually reason for concern.\nBelow is Nvidia's 10-year margin history. There are ups and downs, but the overall trend has been decisively up. This is a winner of a margin profile chart. (I used trailing-12-month margins for all three margin types because this smooths out some of the quarterly ups and downs. But you can also use quarterly data, as that might be easier.)\nNvidia stock has performed amazingly well over the long term, and particularly since 2023. So, in the last year and a half, it has no doubt grown to account for a much larger percentage of many investors' total portfolios.\nNo matter how terrific a company, it's risky to have too many of your eggs in one basket. That's especially true with technology stocks, which tend to be inherently more volatile than stocks of companies in more stable industries.\nSo, it makes good sense for investors to regularly -- perhaps, quarterly or annually -- rebalance their portfolio so no single stock becomes too large a holding relative to their total investments. \"Too large\" is highly subjective, so you'll have to decide what percentage range you're comfortable with.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia After Its Stock Split and 1 Reason to Sell",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the most anticipated stock market events just happened recently: Artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) completed a stock split, bringing down the price of its stock to about $120 from more than $1,200. The 10-for-1 split took place on June 7, and the stock began trading at its new price at the start of trading this week.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight for the past couple of years thanks to its soaring earnings and share price -- the stock has climbed more than 500% over the past three years. And there's a good reason for this kind of success: The company sells the world's top-performing graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that power crucial AI tasks, as well as entire platforms for AI customers. In the most recent quarter, its fiscal 2025 second quarter, Nvidia reported a record $22.6 billion in data center (this includes all AI-related business) revenue, a triple-digit percentage gain from the year-earlier period.\nNow, with the stock trading at one-tenth of its former price, you may be wondering if you should get in on Nvidia. Before deciding, let's consider three reasons to buy and one reason to sell.\nNvidia's recent stock split means you only need about $120 to buy a share -- instead of $1,200 prior to the split. Of course, in pre-split days you could have purchased fractional shares to open a small position in Nvidia or add a bit to your current position. But certain brokerages don't offer fractional shares -- so it isn't as convenient as buying full shares.\nAll of this means that right now, at a lower per-share price, Nvidia offers you more flexibility. You can more easily buy or add to your position with a smaller budget. And if you eventually want to reduce your Nvidia position, you can do so in smaller increments.\nThe stock split itself isn't a reason to buy Nvidia: Instead, you'll want to invest in the company for fundamental reasons such as its earnings track record or long-term outlook. But the new per-share price makes it easier to access Nvidia with a limited investing budget -- making now a good time to get in on the stock.\nAs mentioned, Nvidia's earnings already have taken off in a big way, and this momentum is far from over. Nvidia actually has a new source of revenue growth just ahead. The company is preparing to launch its Blackwell architecture fully loaded with six game-changing technologies -- including Nvidia's most powerful chip ever.\nThis new GPU is packed with 208 billion transistors, compared with 80 billion in the current Nvidia H100 GPU -- and this increase in transistors equals more processing power. Other features include advanced capabilities to protect data and an AI-based maintenance system to predict potential issues and avoid system downtime.\nCustomers already are lining up to get their hands on Blackwell, and Nvidia recently said demand is outstripping supply. And Nvidia expects this trend to continue into next year.\nAll of this means that Nvidia's recent trend of reporting record quarterly data center revenue could continue, boosted by demand for Blackwell.\nFinally, another reason to like Nvidia has to do with its focus on innovation. Blackwell is just ahead, but the company won't rely on this game-changing new system for long.\nNvidia has promised a \"one-year rhythm\" of innovation, meaning the company will release a higher-performance GPU every year.\nThis is key because it may be the one element that keeps Nvidia ahead of rivals. Players like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices recently released new chips, and in certain cases, these may outperform Nvidia's current H100.\nBut that's not a problem for Nvidia, because only a few months later the company will launch an even stronger GPU -- and this should be the scenario year after year.\nNvidia's recent stock split wasn't the company's first. The tech giant completed five prior to this one, and following the past three, the stock spent some time in the doldrums. So, history shows us that Nvidia's stock traditionally hasn't performed well following stock splits.\nIf Nvidia's stock follows the same path this time around, Nvidia shareholders may face a few months of disappointing returns. That means some, especially those who have held Nvidia for years and gained a lot, may consider selling and locking in profits.\nIn my opinion, the arguments for buying Nvidia stock right now outweigh the argument for selling. Yes, Nvidia shares -- if they follow the historical trend -- may not take off right away. But this is a short-term issue. Over time, Nvidia has what it takes to continue climbing: leadership in a growth market, commitment to innovation that should ensure its leadership, a great earnings track record, and encouraging long-term prospects.\nAll of this means that, even if Nvidia slips or stagnates in the coming months, it's not reason to worry. The future looks bright for this AI champion, and that's why the stock makes a great buy right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chip designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) looks virtually unstoppable right about now.\nThe company crushed Wall Street's expectations and management's guidance targets in last week's first-quarter report. A global thirst for artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and particularly for semi-creative generative AI platforms, drove Nvidia's results through the ceiling again.\nAs a result, the stock soared to fresh all-time highs. With a market capitalization of $2.85 trillion, only Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) can claim a larger market value nowadays.\nGiven Nvidia's impressive performance and rich valuation, it's only fair to ask whether the stock can soar any higher from this lofty point. Is Nvidia still a great buy, or is it high time to lock in your Nvidia gains with a quick sell?\nThe company has many things going for it. Covering all of Nvidia's proven or potential growth catalysts would take a book, but let's scratch the surface:\nNvidia is making money hand over fist. Top-line revenue jumped 262% year over year in the first quarter, driving adjusted earnings 461% higher. Free cash flow exploded 479% higher.\nThe company's manufacturing partners, led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung (OTC: SSNL.F), don't have unlimited production capacities. Heavy demand for Nvidia's current lineup of AI accelerator chips has created a backlog of unfilled orders and product delivery wait times of roughly four months. That's down from 11 months in the fall of 2023, partly thanks to export restrictions into China. Still, the supply and-demand equation remains heavily unbalanced in favor of strong demand and limited supply.\nThe generative AI rush is still in its early days. Systems will grow more powerful for many years, requiring a steady flow of increasingly capable number-crunching chips. In other words, Nvidia's game-changing AI revenue streams won't run dry anytime soon.\nNot content to rest on its digital laurels, Nvidia is actively seeking new applications for its proprietary chip architectures. Examples include the Nvidia Drive self-driving vehicle control system and the Project GROOT model for humanoid robotics. These initiatives are fairly small so far but may become serious revenue streams over time.\nOf course, I have to mention the 10-to-1 stock split Nvidia announced alongside its earnings report. The split will take effect on the morning of Monday, June 10, moving share prices down from approximately $1,000 to roughly $100 per share. It's largely an accounting exercise that doesn't add any real value to Nvidia's stock, but it does give shareholders more fine-grained control over the stock. And it's a robust vote of confidence in Nvidia's future -- the board of directors is essentially saying that share prices will continue to rise, so let's make them a bit more affordable right now.\nNvidia has an undeniable collection of shareholder-friendly balls in the air. However, enthusiastic investors may have lifted the stock price too high.\nI'm not saying that Nvidia's stock has peaked and is due for a dramatic plunge. Far from it. The upsides listed earlier should keep the stock afloat for quite a while. Follow the money flowing through the AI market, and you'll find Nvidia firmly parked at the receiving end. Other chip suppliers will surely steal a few contracts over time, but Nvidia is an early leader, and it won't be easy to shake the company off the AI accelerator throne. There's room for several big winners in this corner of Silicon Valley, and Nvidia should be one of them for the foreseeable future.\nSo I wouldn't recommend selling your Nvidia shares today. That's especially true if you have a small stake with one or two Nvidia shares, managed in a stock brokerage that hasn't embraced fractional share trades yet. If you're in that situation and want to reduce your Nvidia exposure -- converting a bit of your paper profits into actual cash returns -- you should wait a while and let the stock split take effect. Then, you'll be able to sell 10% or 30% of your Nvidia holdings instead of dumping the entire investment.\nThat being said, Nvidia's lofty valuation ratios and skyrocketing stock chart are making me nervous. The company is executing with crisp perfection so far, but I don't know how long that streak will last. The history of semiconductors is littered with industry titans running into unexpected issues, and what if Nvidia is next?\nIt's a long way down from a $2.85 trillion market cap. Nvidia shares trade at 35 times sales and 71 times free cash flow, like a hungry little upstart with triple-digit percentage rates of revenue growth. It's just hard to keep up that pace from an already lofty starting point, not to mention the limited supply of chip manufacturing services.\nSo on a scale of buy, sell, or hold, I'd recommend simply holding on to most of your Nvidia shares for now -- with an eye toward buying more after a price correction. I'm certainly not adding to my own Nvidia holdings right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Johnny Rice, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a truly revolutionary technology that has captured the imagination of investors like few things before. This is a double-edged sword, even if the tech really is here to stay. If we learned anything from 2000, it's that too much hype around new technology without the economics to back up sky-high valuations is dangerous territory to be in.\nI don't want to draw too close a parallel here -- there are plenty of reasons to believe this is not dot-com bubble round two -- but it is always prudent to maintain a healthy skepticism during a boom. All eyes -- skeptics' and believers' alike -- are on Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) upcoming annual shareholder meeting.\nOn June 26, 2024, the figurehead of the AI revolution will hold the meeting, discussing strategy and holding votes on action items like board approvals. Typically, annual general meetings don't move the needle as much as earnings reports do, but it's still an important event that could help shed light on what the future holds for Nvidia and the market as a whole.\nSo, with the meeting fast approaching, is it a good time to hop on board the Nvidia train? Here are three reasons the stock still looks strong.\nAs the company has rocketed to stardom and proven how lucrative the business is, its competition wants a piece of that profit. The threat of an AMD or Intel catching up and eating into the roughly 80% market share Nvidia enjoys is real and should be taken seriously. However, Nvidia has major resources to defend itself through constant innovation.\nIn tech, having the best product goes a long way. AMD and Intel need to produce a product comparable to Nvidia's if they hope to chip away at its market share. This takes money -- a lot of it. AMD spent $1.5 billion in research and development (R&D) last quarter, while Nvidia spent $2.7 billion. Remember, Nvidia is already in pole position; it has the best tech on the market, and it's still outspending AMD almost two to one.\nIntel, on the other hand, is outspending both, at $4.4 billion last quarter. The catch here is that this spending is putting Intel in the red. How long can it keep it up?\nTake a look at this chart showing the free cash flow (FCF) of these companies. FCF is a company's income after you've subtracted operating expenses and capital expenditures (the money a company spends to grow) and it is indicative of how much headroom a company has if it wants to, say, increase R&D spending.\nSo if we accept that Nvidia has the resources to defend itself from its primary competitors, we can assume Nvidia can maintain or grow its market share. There are certainly more factors, but it's not an unreasonable assumption.\nStatista.com predicts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the AI market at-large of about 28.5% through 2030. That is a seriously quick rate of growth, albeit slower than the lightning speed at which the company has been growing recently. Still, this would be an incredible growth rate to maintain.\nThis is an estimate for the entire market -- not just semiconductors, which are Nvidia's bread and butter -- so this is a very rough measuring stick. The semiconductor segment could have a lower CAGR rate than this. However, this brings me to my next point.\nThere's no doubt that what has led to Nvidia's massive success as of late is the sale of its powerful AI-enabling chips, but the company sees a future beyond this. Nvidia is attempting to build an entire AI ecosystem. It is partnering with companies like Dell to offer full-scale, on-premises, AI computing solutions. It is building technologies and end-to-end platforms designed for autonomous vehicles, humanoid robotics, and drug research. There's more, but I'll stop here. The point is that Nvidia intends to position itself at the very center of all things AI, as a star that other companies orbit, rather than just one more link in the chain.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Forget the Stock Split: 3 Better Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Right Now",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has more than tripled over the past year alone, to trade at just over $1,208 as of the market close on Friday, June 7. That price made it somewhat inaccessible to smaller investors, because buying one full share might have taken up a disproportionate amount of their portfolio.\nTo solve that problem, Nvidia executed a 10-for-1 stock split (effective on June 10), which increased the number of shares in circulation tenfold, in order to organically reduce the price per share by 90%. As a result, investors can now buy one share in Nvidia for just $120 or so.\nSome Wall Street analysts think the stock split will send Nvidia shares higher in the short term because it attracts a broader investor base, but it's important to remember that it hasn't changed the fundamental value of the company. Here are three better reasons to buy Nvidia stock.\nNvidia's financial results are the core reason for its surging stock price. Demand is off the charts for the company's graphics processing chips (GPUs) for data centers, because they are the best in the industry when it comes to training artificial intelligence (AI) models. I'll discuss this further in a moment.\nIn the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia's data center revenue surged 427% year over year to a record $22.6 billion. It was the latest in a string of incredible results over the past year:\nConsidering that Nvidia has an estimated market share of more than 90% in the AI data center GPU industry, it has significant pricing power, which translates to remarkable profitability. As a result, the company's non-GAAP earnings per share soared 461% year over year during Q1, to $6.12, which followed a series of similar results (note: you can divide the below figures by 10 to account for the stock split):\nSome of Nvidia's biggest customers include cloud giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google. They fill their data centers with advanced chips like Nvidia's H100 GPUs, and they rent the computing power to businesses and AI developers.\nNvidia says cloud providers can earn $5 in revenue over four years for every $1 they spend on data center hardware, because of the incredible demand for that computing power. That equation might grow even more profitable in the future, because Nvidia continues to release chips with better capabilities.\nThe company's new GB200 superchip, for example, is based on its new Blackwell GPU architecture, and it can inference AI models five times faster than the H100. Inferencing involves feeding live data to an AI model so it can make predictions, which makes them faster and more accurate. Blackwell chips are already in production and are expected to reach customers next year -- if H100 demand is any indication, they should be sold out long into the future.\nIn fact, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says the $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure globally will have to double over the next five years to meet demand from AI developers. In other words, there's a $1 trillion opportunity on the table, and considering Nvidia's dominant market share, it's poised to capture an enormous slice of that pie.\nCompetition is coming online from other leading chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices, but it could take years for them to catch up to the performance of Blackwell GPUs.\nIf you refer to the above charts, you can see Nvidia has generated $18 in non-GAAP earnings per share over the last four quarters. That converts to $1.80 per share now that the stock split is in effect, and based on Nvidia's current stock price of $120.88, that places it at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 67.2. That's more than twice as expensive as the 30.9 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index.\nFrom that perspective, Nvidia stock doesn't look like a good value today. However, the picture changes when you factor in the company's future earnings. Wall Street expects Nvidia to generate $2.71 in earnings per share during fiscal 2025, which places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 44.6. Then, in fiscal 2026, its earnings could rise to $3.59, which translates to a forward P/E ratio of 33.7.\nKeep in mind those are the consensus estimates, which Nvidia regularly beats.\nSimply put, Nvidia stock looks cheaper the further into the future you look, so holding it for the long term is critical. The below chart illustrates this perfectly, because it shows how Nvidia's P/E ratio has declined over the past year despite its stock price tripling, because its earnings have grown so quickly:\nOf course, Nvidia won't maintain its triple-digit percentage growth at the top and bottom line for much longer, purely because the numbers have become so large. Therefore, while its stock likely has more upside potential, the best gains are almost certainly in the rear-view mirror.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "In a groundbreaking development, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has overtaken Microsoft Corporation MSFT to become the most valuable company in the world. This milestone underscores NVIDIA's robust market position and the burgeoning demand for its innovative technologies.\nNVIDIA achieved this milestone in just two weeks after its valuation crossed the $3 trillion mark for the first time ever earlier this month, which aided it in taking the number two spot from Apple Inc. AAPL. It took NVIDIA just around three months to attain the $3 trillion milestone from the $2 trillion market capitalization as of Mar 1, 2024.\nNVDA stock rose 3.5% during yesterday\u2019s intraday trading session and closed at $135.58, reaching its market capitalization of $3.335 trillion. Microsoft slipped to the second position with a market cap of $3.317 trillion, while Apple continues to be in the third spot with a market value of $3.286 trillion.\nNVIDIA has witnessed a remarkable run, showcasing a whopping 175.1% surge in its stock price year to date. The stock has outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s year-to-date growth of 118.8%. The surge reflects investors' confidence in NVIDIA's strategic positioning, robust financial performance and pivotal role in shaping transformative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), gaming and data center solutions.\nNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\nNVIDIA's impressive stock performance has largely been fueled by expectations that the company will significantly benefit from the increasing investments in generative AI. With its leading position in this space and the numerous opportunities generative AI presents, NVIDIA's stock appears set to maintain its momentum throughout the year.\nThe rising demand for workflow modernization across various industries is anticipated to boost the need for generative AI applications. According to a recent report by Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is projected to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.\nHowever, generative AI requires extensive knowledge for content creation and substantial computational power. Consequently, enterprises aiming to develop generative AI-based applications will need to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\nNVIDIA's next-generation chips, known for their high computing power, are likely to become the preferred choice for enterprises. The company's GPUs are already being utilized in AI models, which is broadening NVIDIA's presence in emerging markets such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\nThe generative AI revolution is expected to generate significant demand for NVIDIA's next-generation, high-computing power chips. Given the rising AI investments in the data center sector, NVIDIA anticipates its second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues to soar to $28 billion, up from $13.51 billion in the same quarter the previous year.\nNVIDIA's robust product portfolio, leadership in AI and relentless innovation present a compelling investment opportunity. It enjoys high market esteem, and astute investors should consider leveraging NVDA's potential for sustained long-term growth.\nNVIDIA boasts an impressive long-term expected earnings growth rate of 37.6%, significantly outpacing the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry's growth rate of 18.9%. The company's earnings have consistently exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 18.4%.\nFinancially, NVIDIA is on solid ground, with ample cash reserves that provide a cushion against market volatility. As of Apr 28, 2024, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $31.44 billion, up from $25.98 billion on Jan 28, 2024.\nHowever, NVIDIA's stock trades at a one-year forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 25.99, which is significantly higher than the Semiconductor \u2013 General industry's forward P/S multiple of 20.80. While this might be perceived as a risk, we believe the premium is warranted due to NVIDIA's consistent financial performance and substantial growth prospects in emerging sectors such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and currently boasts a Growth Score of A, making it a highly attractive investment option, according to Zacks' proprietary methodology.\nAnother top-ranked stock from the broader technology sector is Datadog, Inc.

The new platform, called Rubin, is the successor to Nvidia's Blackwell platform, which it unveiled in March.\nWhile the CEO offered scant details on Rubin, he did mention that the platform will also include a new Arm-based CPU called Vera and will come to market in 2026. Huang also announced a more powerful version of its Blackwell platform called Blackwell Ultra coming in 2025, as well as an Ultra version of the Rubin platform for 2027.\nShares of the AI chip giant were up more than 3% in as of noon Monday.\nNvidia is the leader in AI chips thanks to early investments in the technology that have put it well ahead of its rivals in terms of hardware capabilities and software features. That's helped to make the company's offerings invaluable not only to cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, but to businesses ranging from healthcare to the automotive industry. That's helped power Nvidia's incredible growth over the last year, with revenue jumping 262% year over year from $7.19 billion to $26 billion in Q1.\nNvidia has the third-largest market capitalization in the world among publicly traded companies at $2.79 trillion. Microsoft and Apple sit at $3.08 trillion and 2.98 trillion, respectively.

        "Author": "  Jason Ma ",
        "Text": "Nvidia stock has continued its stunning rally this year, sending the AI chip leader's valuation past $3 trillion and making it an even bigger presence in the S&P 500.\nIn fact, 34.5% of the S&P 500's market cap gains so far this year can be attributed to Nvidia alone, according to Apollo Chief Economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k.\nShares have soared 166% in the year to date and are up more than 200% from this time a year ago. That's as the artificial intelligence craze has gripped Wall Street, and Nvidia's quarterly earnings show no sign that the rush to stock up on AI chips isn't slowing down.\nBut relying so much on one stock also represents a big risk, Sl\u00f8k warned.\n\"Such a high concentration implies that if NVIDIA continues to rise, then things are fine,\" he wrote in a note on Wednesday. \"But if it starts to decline, then the S&P 500 will be hit hard.\"\nBecause the S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, even relatively minor wobbles from behemoths like Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft can move the needle on the broad stock market index.\nAnd as retail investors increasingly load up on S&P 500 index funds, that means exposure to Nvidia\u2014for better or for worse\u2014is growing as well.\n\"The bottom line is that the extreme concentration of returns in the S&P 500 makes investors more vulnerable to single headlines impacting the one stock driving index returns,\" Sl\u00f8k added.\nThis isn't the first time he has sounded the alarm on the stock market's dependence on Big Tech.\nWhen Nvidia's market cap topped $2 trillion for the first time ever earlier this year, Sl\u00f8k compared tech valuations to the bubble seen during the dot-com era.\n\u201cThe top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than the top 10 companies were during the tech bubble in the mid-1990s,\u201d he wrote at the time.\nOthers on Wall Street are also growing more skeptical about Nvidia's valuation and its attractiveness as an investment after the stock's epic rally.\nBut Nvidia stock bulls remain. Beth Kindig, lead tech analyst at the I/O Fund, sees more astronomical gains in the coming years, predicting its market cap will surge more than triple again to $10 trillion by 2030.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang continues to surprise Wall Street, most recently by laying out a rapid cadence of new AI platforms.\nEarlier this month, he said Nvidia plans to upgrade its AI accelerators every year as he announced the Blackwell Ultra chip for 2025 and a next-generation platform in development called Rubin for 2026.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said the company plans to upgrade its AI accelerators every year, announcing a Blackwell Ultra chip for 2025 and a next-generation platform in development called Rubin for 2026.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBlackRock, Citadel Back Texas Stock Exchange in Challenge to NYSE\nS&P 500 Hits 25th Record This Year as Tech Soars: Markets Wrap\nSEC Hedge Fund Fee Disclosure Rule Struck Down by US Court\nGoldman Sees \u2018Wall of Money\u2019 Fueling Stock Market\u2019s Summer Party\nModi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority\nThe company \u2014 now best known for its artificial intelligence data center systems \u2014 also introduced new tools and software models on the eve of the Computex trade show in Taiwan. Nvidia sees the rise of generative AI as a new industrial revolution and expects to play a major role as the technology shifts to personal computers, the CEO said in a keynote address at National Taiwan University.\nNvidia has been the main beneficiary of a massive flood of AI spending, helping turn the company into the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker. But it now looks to broaden its customer base beyond the handful of cloud-computing giants that generate much of its sales. As part of the expansion, Huang expects a larger swath of companies and government agencies to embrace AI \u2014 everyone from shipbuilders to drug developers. He returned to themes he set out a year ago at the same venue, including the idea that those without AI capabilities will be left behind.\n\u201cWe are seeing computation inflation,\u201d Huang said on Sunday. As the amount of data that needs to be processed grows exponentially, traditional computing methods cannot keep up and it\u2019s only through Nvidia\u2019s style of accelerated computing that we can cut back the costs, Huang said. He touted 98% cost savings and 97% less energy required with Nvidia\u2019s technology, saying that constituted \u201cCEO math, which is not accurate, but it is correct.\u201d\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and other suppliers rose after the announcement. TSMC\u2019s stock climbed as much as 3.9%, while Wistron Corp. gained 4%.\nHuang said the upcoming Rubin AI platform will use HBM4, the next iteration of the essential high-bandwidth memory that\u2019s grown into a bottleneck for AI accelerator production, with leader SK Hynix Inc. largely sold out through 2025. He otherwise did not offer detailed specifications for the upcoming products, which will follow Blackwell.\n\u201cI think teasing out Rubin and Rubin Ultra was extremely clever and is indicative of its commitment to a year-over-year refresh cycle,\u201d said Dan Newman, CEO and chief analyst at Futurum Group. \u201cWhat I feel he hammered home most clearly is the cadence of innovation, and the company\u2019s relentless pursuit of maximizing the limit of technology including software, process, packaging and partnerships to protect and expand its moat and market position.\u201d\nNvidia got its start selling gaming cards for desktop PCs, and that background is coming into play as computer makers push to add more AI functions to their machines.\nMicrosoft Corp. and its hardware partners are using Computex to show off new laptops with AI enhancements under the branding of Copilot+. The majority of those devices coming to market are based on a new type of processor that will enable them to go longer on one battery charge, provided by Nvidia rival Qualcomm Inc.\nWhile those devices are good for simple AI functionality, adding an Nvidia graphics card will massively increase their performance and bring new features to popular software like games, Nvidia said. PC makers such as Asustek Computer Inc. are offering such computers, the company said.\nTo help software makers bring more new capabilities to the PC, Nvidia is offering tools and pretrained AI models. They will handle complex tasks, such as deciding whether to crunch data on the machine itself or send it out to a data center over the internet.\nSeparately, Nvidia is releasing a new design for server computers built on its chips. The MGX program is used by companies such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. and Dell Technologies Inc. to allow them to get to market faster with products that are used by corporations and government agencies. Even rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp. are taking advantage of the design with servers that put their processors alongside Nvidia chips.\nAMD CEO Lisa Su took the stage at Computex the day after Huang\u2019s comments, sketching out her company\u2019s progress in AI chips. AMD is speeding up the introduction of its AI processsors as it seeks to close the gap with Nvidia in the fast-growing field.\nNvidia\u2019s earlier-announced products, such as Spectrum X for networking and Nvidia Inference Microservices \u2014 or NIM, which Huang called \u201cAI in a box\u201d \u2014 are now generally available and being widely adopted, the company said. It\u2019s also going to offer free access to the NIM products. The microservices are a set of intermediate software and models that help companies roll out AI services more quickly, without having to worry about the underlying technology. Companies that deploy them then have to pay Nvidia a usage fee.\nHuang also promoted the use of digital twins in a virtual world that Nvidia calls the Ominverse. To show the scale possible, he showed a digital twin of planet Earth, called Earth 2, and how it can help conduct more sophisticated weather pattern modeling and other complex tasks. He noted that Taiwan-based contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., also known as Foxconn, are using the tools to make plans and operate their factories more efficiently.\n--With assistance from Jane Lanhee Lee.\n(Updates with analyst comment from sixth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "Author": "  Akim Guerreiro ",
        "Text": "The best way to describe the hype Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) represents in people's minds is through a recent quote from company's own founder and CEO, Jensen Huang:\nThe next industrial revolution has begun companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center AI factories to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence.\"\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIn a world where artificial intelligence has turned into a commodity and become the new gold, and where every business will be searching for its share of the treasure, Nvidia will be selling the shovels. And Huang made it clear: the new shovels are the data centers.\nTo illustrate this point further, Nvidia's stock price reflects the AI rush it has been benefiting from.\nThe tech company operates through four business segments, all of which support its growth: Data Center (the largest one), Gaming and AI PC (the second largest), Professional Visualization and Automotive and Robotics.\nFirst, we will look at the financials with a focus on these four pillars of the company's growth.\nThe reason Nvidia is so attractive as a growth stock is not only its recent high growth rates, but the fact it is supported by all four business segments. All four divisions saw sales grow by at least double digits from a year ago.\nThe first-quarter financial results, which were released on May 22, reveal impressive growth rates. Nvidia broke the record of quarterly revenue with a $26 billion figure, up 18% from the fourth quarter and 262% from a year ago.\nIn the Data Center business, revenue hit a record $22.60 billion, up 23% from the previous quarter and 427% from a year ago. In the Gaming and AI PC business segment, sales were $2.60 billion, down 8% from the previous quarter but still up 18% from a year ago. In the Professional Visualization division, revenue was $427 million, down 8% from the previous quarter but up 45% from a year ago. Last but not least, sales in the Automotive and Robotics unit hit $329 million, up 17% from the previous quarter and up 11% from a year ago.\nEvery single business segment had at least double-digit growth. Given that there are four solid pillars supporting Nvidia's growth, it is unlikely that all of them will crash at the same time.\nNvidia is clearly valued like a high-growth stock would be. Using trailing metrics, the stock is trading at 40 times last 12-month revenue, around 65 times Ebitda and 76 times earnings per share, both in the highest range of the historical valuation of the stock.\nLooking ahead, the stock is trading at about 25 times forward revenue and 38 times forward Ebitda, which, despite being cheaper than a year ago, remains in the higher range of the historical valuation as well. A fairer valuation brings it closer to the GF Value of around $90 (on a post-split basis), which is a 30% to 40% discount to the current price and the price it was trading at toward the end of the first quarter of the year. It seems the excitement around the stock caused the market to overbuy, ignoring the slowing growth trend that is starting from this quarter onward.\nIndeed, the key risk here is that Nvidia is trading with an assumption of high growth, while the company's growth is expected to significantly slow down, which could cause a sharp contraction to its valuation, as is typically the case for growth stocks with fading growth.\nThe year-over-year revenue growth rate peaked in the fourth quarter, reaching 265%, and pulled back slightly to 262% in the first quarter. However, the stock is expected to only gain 109% in the second quarter, 72% in the third quarter, 55% in the fourth quarter and 36% in the first quarter of 2025. The downtrend is evident as the AI boom slows down, global economies potentially fall into a recession after a long tight monetary cycle and as competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) come after Nvidia's market share.\nThere is a second risk, however, which is what fueled the growth of Nvidia over the last several quarters: its exposure and overconcentration to a few companies, namely the Magnificent Seven. Indeed, Bloomberg data estimates that Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) makes up 15% of Nvidia's revenue, followed by Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) at 13%, Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) at 6% and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) at about 6%. This means that 40% of the company's revenue comes from four companies, which in turns means the latter have significant leverage in negotiating contracts with Nvidia while its competitors continue to catch up.\nHence, despite the company being high growth, its stretched valuation and customer concentration warrant caution.\nNvidia is selling the shovels to the gold miners, and there is an increasing number of them. Indeed, numerous partnerships announced during the last earnings release fuel optimism of renewed growth in the coming quarters.\nIn the Data Center segment, Nvidia announced Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) are going into production with Nvidia cuLitho to accelerate computational lithography, the semiconductor manufacturing industry's most compute-intensive workload. The company also expanded collaborations with Amazon's AWS, Alphabet's Google Cloud, Microsoft and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to advance generative AI innovation.\nAdditionally, the Data Center business partnered with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) MedTech to implement AI into surgery. For the Professional Visualization unit, Nvidia announced an expansion of the Siemens partnership and a new framework for the Apple Vision Pro.\nLast but not least, in the Automotive and Robotics division, Nvidia announced exciting partnerships with Chinese automakers BYD (BYDDY) and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) and American EV producer Lucid (NASDAQ:LUCD) to power their next-generation vehicle fleets.\nThis impressive pipeline shows Nvidia might have new growth catalysts up its sleeve that could help the stock outperform the broader market in the coming quarters.\nNvidia's astonishing ability to grow year after year and to find new sources and catalysts of growth makes the stock an attractive one to own in a growth-oriented portfolio. However, given the slowing growth and sales overconcentration risks, caution is advised.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

Apple is the third most valuable company in the US with a $3.27 trillion market cap.\nNvidia shares closed 3.5% higher on Tuesday. Microsoft shares fell 0.5% and Apple shares lost 1.1%. Nvidia earlier this month joined the tech giants in becoming the only US companies to cross a $3 trillion market cap.\nThe chipmaker\u2019s stock has been on a tear for the last year and a half. Nvidia\u2019s chips are unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including for generative AI, the technology backing OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT that can create text, images and other media.\nNvidia is the leader of the tech behemoth Magnificent Seven stocks that have driven much of the stock market\u2019s returns since the artificial intelligence frenzy overtook Wall Street last year. The company\u2019s stock is up roughly 174% for the year and was the S&P 500 index\u2019s best performer in 2023.\nThe Jensen Huang-led company\u2019s dethroning of Microsoft comes as Wall Street\u2019s most prominent tech companies battle for the coveted top spot. Apple on June 13 became the most valuable US company as announcements made at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, including generative AI features for the iPhone, sent the stock climbing. The iPhone maker\u2019s market cap slid back below Microsoft\u2019s just a day later.\nNvidia completed a 10-for-1 stock split on June 7. The chipmaker last month posted yet another blockbuster quarter, noting a 262% increase in revenue and a 462% increase in profits year-over-year.\nCNN\u2019s Samantha Delouya and Clare Duffy contributed to this report.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

Huang went as far as to tease a chip envisioned for 2026 he dubbed Rubin \u2014 after Vera Rubin, the American woman who helped discover dark matter. The chip, which will succeed the Blackwell family, will be key to sustaining its runaway leadership.\nWhile Huang headlined much of his own two-hour presentation on Sunday, AMD\u2019s Su chose to make hers more of a team effort. She brought out a stream of big-name partners from HP Inc. CEO Enrique Lores to Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s Luca Rossi to convey the company\u2019s focus on designing neural processors \u2014 a type of chip that runs AI services directly from laptops. At one point during her Computex address, Asustek Computer Inc. Chairman Jonney Shih called her \u201cthe pride of Taiwan\u201d \u2014 a characterization often associated with Huang of Nvidia, whose market valuation is now about 10 times that of AMD\u2019s.\n\u201cPeople see Nvidia as a personification of Jensen. And while Lisa is the savior of AMD, she\u2019s very clear that it\u2019s about everyone around her,\u201d said Ian Cutress, chief analyst at the consultancy More Than Moore. \u201cAMD still have that underdog element about the business, and with AI it\u2019s very much true.\u201d\nThe back-to-back presentations \u2014 attended by hundreds and watched by thousands more across the globe \u2014 underscore the growing stakes in a technology that has the potential to redefine a slew of industries and create new devices that can near-instantly generate video and other content from simple commands.\nThere\u2019s a personal component to the competition too. Su and Huang are not only both Taiwanese, they were born in the same city of roughly 1.8 million on Taiwan\u2019s southern coast and are distant relatives. That hasn\u2019t made either one more willing to cede ground to the other.\nSu was originally tapped by organizers to kick off the week-long conference, one of the most important summits for tech executives around the world. Instead, the Nvidia CEO organized his own presentation the Sunday night before the gathering\u2019s official opening to talk about the chipmaker\u2019s strategic plans.\nHuang, who had keynoted Computex a year earlier, spoke at National Taiwan University just hours before the conference opened, essentially stealing the spotlight from his closest competitor. AMD\u2019s Su on Monday referred obliquely to the episode during an OpenAI demo of a chatbot.\n\u201cLet\u2019s start by letting the tool know that we\u2019re interested in Taiwan, and that we\u2019re going to be attending Computex,\u201d Su said. \u201cAnd you might ask something about the opening keynote,\u201d she quipped, drawing laughter from the audience.\nNvidia sees the rise of generative AI as a new industrial revolution and expects to play a major role as the technology shifts to personal computers, the CEO said in his keynote address at National Taiwan University. He returned to themes he set out a year ago at the same venue, including the idea that those without AI capabilities will be left behind.\nDelegates to Computex remarked that Huang\u2019s performance drove home Nvidia\u2019s continued dominance \u2014 a position that appeared difficult for AMD or any other rival to shake in the short run. One fund manager told Bloomberg News that Huang generated a lot of buzz in particular around Rubin, even though the CEO didn\u2019t go into detail about a chip slated for 2026.\nShares of Nvidia rose 4.9% in New York on Monday, leaving them up 132% this year. AMD declined 2%.\nNvidia is selling customers a fully proprietary system, where businesses can buy its chips, networking gear and everything else required to run advanced AI development in data centers he\u2019s called \u2018AI factories.\u2019 AMD, on the other hand, touts open standards that make its hardware interoperable with that of rivals like Intel Corp.\nHuang said the upcoming Rubin AI platform will use HBM4, the next iteration of the essential high-bandwidth memory that\u2019s grown into a bottleneck for AI accelerator production. Leading manufacturer SK Hynix Inc. is largely sold out through 2025. He otherwise didn\u2019t offer detailed specifications for Nvidia\u2019s upcoming products.\n\u201cTeasing out Rubin and Rubin Ultra was extremely clever and is indicative of its commitment to a year-over-year refresh cycle,\u201d said Dan Newman, CEO and chief analyst at Futurum Group. \u201cWhat I feel he hammered home most clearly is the cadence of innovation, and the company\u2019s relentless pursuit of maximizing the limit of technology including software, process, packaging and partnerships to protect and expand its moat and market position.\u201d\nRead More: Samsung Replaces Chip Chief After SK Hynix Takes AI Lead\nBut it was Su who commanded a broader, star-studded supporting lineup. She was joined onstage by Microsoft Windows chief Pavan Davuluri, a key leader of a company that\u2019s regarded as stealing a march on Google and Baidu Inc. in the generative AI revolution.\nShe and her partners used their Computex slot to show off new laptops with AI enhancements branded Copilot+. The majority of those devices coming to market are based on NPUs, which are more efficient at handling AI tasks and thus help extend battery life. Qualcomm Inc. was among the first out of the gate with Copilot+ PCs, but AMD\u2019s response will be on the market from July. Nvidia has no comparable offering.\nSu concluded her keynote by returning to a key sphere of competition: data centers and AI training. She matched Huang\u2019s annual upgrade timeline by announcing new AI chips for 2025 and 2026 and promising to speed up the rate of improvement from her company\u2019s semiconductors.\n\u201cThe major difference between the two to me is that Jensen is not only technical and visionary, he\u2019s also a salesman. Lisa is much more execution-focused,\u201d said Dave Altavilla, principal analyst at HotTech Vision and Analysis. \u201cShe has her work cut out for her, and they\u2019re picking spots where it matters, and the data center is obviously where the high margin is.\u201d\n--With assistance from Ian King and Nick Turner.\n(Updates with closing share prices in the thirteenth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "Title": "Prediction: Nvidia, Now the World's Most Valuable Company, Will Hit a Market Cap of $5 Trillion by 2026",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) made history on Tuesday, sailing past Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of $3.335 trillion.\nThe stock has been on a meteoric rise over the past 18 months, soaring 8,280% since the start of 2023 (as of this writing). Nvidia has been riding the wave of accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), providing the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are the gold standard for powering the systems responsible for AI training and inference.\nThe company also completed a 10-for-1 stock split that was a hit with investors, driving the stock even higher.\nWith gains of that magnitude, it would be easy to conclude that the opportunity has passed, and the easy money has already been made. I think that view could be a costly one, as I predict that Nvidia's market cap is headed to $5 trillion, which would push its share price above $203, representing upside of 50% compared to the Tuesday's closing price.\nLet's take a look at how Nvidia could get there in the not-too-distant future.\nGenerative AI burst onto the scene last year, touting the ability to streamline and automate time-consuming and mundane tasks. The potential to increase worker productivity was met with cheers from corporate America as companies race to adopt these next-generation algorithms.\nNvidia supplies the processors with the computational horsepower necessary to run these AI systems. The company has been scrambling as demand has far outstripped supply. The supply shortages are beginning to ease as Nvidia has worked with its partners to ramp up production.\nFurthermore, the company has a virtual monopoly on machine learning (an earlier branch of AI) with an estimated 95% share of the market, according to data compiled by New Street Research. This helps explain why demand for generative AI quickly became a boon to Nvidia, given its proven expertise in the area.\nThere's more: The need to upgrade data centers to handle the rigors of AI has been at the heart of the current demand cycle, which is expected to continue. The vast majority of generative AI processing takes place in data centers and in the cloud, and it's estimated Nvidia controls 92% of the data center GPU market, according to IoT Analytics.\nRobust growth is expected to continue across the data center market, climbing from $302 billion in 2023 to $622 billion by 2030, according to Prescient and Strategic Intelligence Market Research. As the leading provider of data center GPUs, this trend favors Nvidia.\nLet's not forget, however, that it all began with the humble GPUs used to render lifelike images in video games, another area Nvidia dominates. Despite growing competition, it maintains a healthy lead in the industry it pioneered. In the first quarter of 2024, it controlled an 88% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, according to Jon Peddie Research.\nAs inflation subsides, the pent-up demand for new, state-of-the-art graphics cards will drive a new upgrade cycle for Nvidia gaming chips. Sales of gaming GPUs are expected to soar from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $11.7 billion by 2028, according to Mordor Intelligence. As the market leader, this trend also favors Nvidia.\nThe company has a number of other opportunities that could take off, including self-driving cars, professional visualization, and quantum computing, which currently make up just a small percentage of the company's overall sales.\nLastly, the Nvidia GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip will be released later this year, setting a new standard for AI processing. The largest hyperscale cloud-infrastructure providers are already lining up to pay top dollar for these state-of-the-art AI platforms, which suggests the company will remain as the AI market leader.\nNvidia currently has a market cap of roughly $3.34 trillion, which means it will require stock price gains of roughly 50% to drive its value to $5 trillion. That seems like small change compared to its 2024 year-to-date gains of 174%, so it's likely just a matter of time.\nAccording to Wall Street's consensus estimates, the company is expected to generate revenue of $120.5 billion in fiscal 2025 (which began in January). That gives the stock a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 28. If that P/S remains constant, Nvidia will need to generate annual revenue of roughly $180 billion to support a $5 trillion market cap.\nCoincidentally, Wall Street is already guiding for revenue growth of 98% in fiscal 2025 (this calendar year) and 33% in fiscal 2026. If the company hits those targets, it could achieve a $5 trillion market cap as early as 2026.\nDon't take my word for it. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann just reaffirmed his buy rating on Nvidia stock and assigned a Street-high $200 price target, citing greater demands for AI software and the release of the Blackwell architecture later this year.\nIt's important to note that there are no guarantees. Any failure to achieve investors' lofty ambitions -- real or perceived -- would likely be met with a quick and potentially brutal sell-off. On the other hand, it's just as likely that Nvidia's market dominance could continue, and the timeline calculated above could end up being conservative.\nThe stock is currently selling for 51 times forward earnings, which might seem expensive, but that doesn't take into consideration the stock's 27,570% gains over the past decade. To be clear, there's little chance the next decade will be as lucrative as the past 10 years have been.\nThat said, given Nvidia's dominant place in the industry and the gale-force secular tailwinds at its back, the chances it will be a market-beating investment in the coming years are exceptional.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Alexis Keenan    \u00b7 Senior Legal Reporter",
        "Text": "The biggest antitrust regulators in the US are stepping up their scrutiny of the nation\u2019s most powerful developers of artificial intelligence.\nThe Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have launched and divided up investigations of Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and OpenAI, according to reporting from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.\nThe DOJ will lead a probe of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) dominance in the market for microprocessors that power AI, according to the Times. The FTC would lead antitrust investigations into Microsoft and OpenAI.\nThe new scrutiny is part of a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\nThe administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.\nIt also took to trial a case filed by the Trump administration over Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) dominance in search. A judge is currently weighing the evidence in that case, with a decision expected this year.\nThe efforts have not always been successful. The FTC failed in its challenge against Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and fell short in a separate battle to prevent Meta (META) from being able to purchase VR company Within.\nThe FTC made it clear last year that it wanted to look a lot closer at the burgeoning field of AI, though its precise markets of concern within the AI landscape have not been made clear.\nIf regulators do assert antitrust violations, they would first need to prove to a judge that they've identified a relevant market, the products or services at the heart of a claim.\n\"DOJ and FTC are notorious for not divulging the specifics of what they're focusing on and where they are in an investigation,\" antitrust attorney David Reichenberg, a partner with Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, told Yahoo Finance.\nIt's common, Reichenberg said, for regulators to worry about competition when one company controls a resource that's in such demand that it becomes an \"essential facility\" \u2014 a product or service considered necessary for market competition.\nAnd it's possible here that regulators want to ensure that Nvidia's semiconductors, which are required for leading AI development, remain widely accessible at a reasonable price.\nWhat the FTC said last July that it had started a consumer protection-based investigation into OpenAI\u2019s data collection practices and potential harms caused by the output of its large language models (LLMs).\nThen, in January, it began a broader inquiry into deals between Big Tech and AI developers, including Microsoft\u2019s $13 billion investment in OpenAI and Alphabet\u2019s relationship with rival AI developer Anthropic.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC\u2019s probe of Microsoft will extend beyond an examination of the tech giant's conduct to include a deal it reached with AI developer Inflection AI.\nAccording to the Journal, the FTC wants to know why Microsoft chose to pay Inflection a $650 million licensing fee to resell Inflection's technology, rather than buy it. The regulator's interest was piqued, according to the report, because Microsoft also acquired most of Inflection\u2019s staff as part of the accord.\nIn response to the report, Microsoft\u2019s spokesperson said the agreements with Inflection gave it an opportunity to recruit Inflection AI staff and accelerate the development of its AI chat interface Microsoft Copilot.\nThat structure, Microsoft said, enables Inflection to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio.\n\"We take our legal obligations to report transactions under the HSR Act seriously and are confident that we have complied with those obligations,\" the spokesperson said.\nBoth companies received subpoenas from the FTC asking for information tied to the deal, the Journal reported.\nNvidia declined to comment on the reports.\nMichael Carrier, an antitrust expert and co-director of Rutgers Institute for Information Policy and Law, said antitrust regulators looking to test the Microsoft agreement against antitrust laws will look to the substance and not the structure of the deal.\n\"The agency will try to determine whether Microsoft restructured this deal in a way that gave it control of InflectionAI while avoiding FTC review of the transaction,\" Carrier said.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

As of 1:59 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 5.8%, taking it back above that psychologically important $3 trillion market cap.\nThe catalyst that sent the chipmaker and artificial intelligence (AI) specialist higher was word that the company was entering an important new market, which could boost future sales.\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard and a key component in the rise of generative AI. These processors provide the computational horsepower necessary to speed the process of AI training and inference, which primarily occurs in data centers.\nThe company has inked a deal to bring its AI expertise to telecom company Ooredoo in the Middle Eastern country of Qatar. The agreement will provide its customers in Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait, and the Maldives \"direct access\" to Nvidia's AI technology, according to a report by Reuters.\nThe U.S. government has limits on what technology Nvidia can export to Middle Eastern countries to keep its most sophisticated technology from being accessed by China. The report suggests that Nvidia would comply with the government mandates while also playing an important role in supplying AI chips to the region.\nThe news comes in the wake of Nvidia's most recent blockbuster financial report, continuing its triple-digit revenue and profit growth. This, in turn, has fueled its surging stock price and recent 10-for-1 stock split.\nSome investors have expressed concern that the next leg of Nvidia's growth could stall, and they wonder how far AI has left to run. Most experts concur, however, that the adoption of AI is still in the early innings. Generative AI will become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032, according to estimates provided by Bloomberg Intelligence.\nFurthermore, at roughly 35 times forward earnings, Nvidia stock is still reasonably priced, particularly in light of the ongoing opportunity presented by AI.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center \u2014 AI factories \u2014 to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence,\u201d said Huang. \u201cFrom server, networking and infrastructure manufacturers to software developers, the whole industry is gearing up for Blackwell to accelerate AI-powered innovation for every field.\u201d\nTo address applications of all types, the offerings will range from single to multi-GPUs, x86- to Grace-based processors, and air- to liquid-cooling technology.\nAdditionally, to speed up the development of systems of different sizes and configurations, the NVIDIA MGX\u2122 modular reference design platform now supports NVIDIA Blackwell products. This includes the new NVIDIA GB200 NVL2 platform, built to deliver unparalleled performance for mainstream large language model inference, retrieval-augmented generation and data processing.\nGB200 NVL2 is ideally suited for emerging market opportunities such as data analytics, on which companies spend tens of billions of dollars annually. Taking advantage of high-bandwidth memory performance provided by NVLink\u00ae-C2C interconnects and dedicated decompression engines in the Blackwell architecture speeds up data processing by up to 18x, with 8x better energy efficiency compared to using x86 CPUs.\nModular Reference Architecture for Accelerated ComputingTo meet the diverse accelerated computing needs of the world\u2019s data centers, NVIDIA MGX provides computer manufacturers with a reference architecture to quickly and cost-effectively build more than 100 system design configurations.\nManufacturers start with a basic system architecture for their server chassis, and then select their GPU, DPU and CPU to address different workloads. To date, more than 90 systems from over 25 partners have been released or are in development that leverage the MGX reference architecture, up from 14 systems from six partners last year. Using MGX can help slash development costs by up to three-quarters and reduce development time by two-thirds, to just six months.\nAMD and Intel are supporting the MGX architecture with plans to deliver, for the first time, their own CPU host processor module designs. This includes the next-generation AMD Turin platform and the Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae 6 processor with P-cores (formerly codenamed Granite Rapids). Any server system builder can use these reference designs to save development time while ensuring consistency in design and performance.\nNVIDIA\u2019s latest platform, the GB200 NVL2, also leverages MGX and Blackwell. Its scale-out, single-node design enables a wide variety of system configurations and networking options to seamlessly integrate accelerated computing into existing data center infrastructure.\nThe GB200 NVL2 joins the Blackwell product lineup, which also includes NVIDIA Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs, GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips and the GB200 NVL72.\nAn Ecosystem UnitesNVIDIA\u2019s comprehensive partner ecosystem includes TSMC, the world\u2019s leading semiconductor manufacturer and an NVIDIA foundry partner, as well as global electronics makers, which provide key components to create AI factories. These include manufacturing innovations such as server racks, power delivery, cooling solutions and more from companies such as Amphenol, Asia Vital Components (AVC), Cooler Master, Colder Products Company (CPC), Danfoss, Delta Electronics and LITEON.\nAs a result, new data center infrastructure can quickly be developed and deployed to meet the needs of the world\u2019s enterprises \u2014 and further accelerated by Blackwell technology, NVIDIA Quantum-2 or Quantum-X800 InfiniBand networking, NVIDIA Spectrum\u2122-X Ethernet networking and NVIDIA BlueField\u00ae-3 DPUs \u2014 in servers from leading systems makers Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo.\nEnterprises can also access the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which includes NVIDIA NIM\u2122 inference microservices, to create and run production-grade generative AI applications.\nTaiwan Embraces BlackwellHuang also announced during his keynote that Taiwan's leading companies are rapidly adopting Blackwell to bring the power of AI to their own businesses.\nTaiwan\u2019s leading medical center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, plans to use the NVIDIA Blackwell computing platform to advance biomedical research and accelerate imaging and language applications to improve clinical workflows, ultimately enhancing patient care.\nFoxconn, one of the world\u2019s largest makers of electronics, is planning to use NVIDIA Grace Blackwell to develop smart solution platforms for AI-powered electric vehicle and robotics platforms, as well as a growing number of language-based generative AI services to provide more personalized experiences to its customers.\nAdditional Supporting Quotes\nR.

        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the technology world by storm. Few companies have benefited more than hardware giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which supply the data center equipment needed to support this fast-growing industry. \nBusiness is booming, and both companies have turned to stock splits to keep their shares liquid and available to smaller investors. Let's explore the long-term prospects of both companies while acknowledging the potential challenges they may face in the near term.\nAfter seeing its shares rise over 3,500% in just five years, it's no surprise that Nvidia relies on frequent stock splits to keep its share price under control. The most recent was a 10-for-1 split, effective as of June 7, that brought its stock to around $120 per share. And with the artificial intelligence industry in its early innings, Nvidia is still a long-term winner.\nThere is no shortage of grandiose projections for the future of AI. Bloomberg Intelligence believes the industry could be worth a whopping $1.3 trillion by 2032. And with an 80% market share in the advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to power the large language models, Nvidia undeniably has a bright future from a demand perspective.\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 51, Nvidia's shares are also fairly valued relative to growth. First-quarter revenue increased 262% year over year to $26 billion while net income surged 628% to $14.9 billion. \nThat said, every new industry experiences growing pains. And with 87% of Nvidia's sales coming from data center hardware, the company is exceptionally vulnerable to any near-term slowdown in AI chip demand, even if its long-term future remains bright.\nWith an unusually high stock price of $1,735 per share, Broadcom seemed overdue for a split when it announced a 10-for-1 swap expected to go live on July 15. Like Nvidia, the company's stock has soared amid rising AI hardware demand. However, its lower valuation and more diversified revenue streams could make it a safer way to bet on this opportunity.\nWhile Nvidia is known for its general-purpose AI chips, Broadcom specializes in custom chips designed for its client's specific workloads. This niche allows its hardware to be more cost- and energy-efficient than mass-market alternatives. And business is booming.\nSecond-quarter revenue jumped 43% year over year to $12.5 billion, helped by rising AI-related demand and the recent acquisition of VMware, a cloud computing company focused on virtual machines, which can run apps on software instead of physical computers. VMware helps diversify Broadcom into many different sides of the tech industry, shielding it from a potential slowdown in demand for AI chips.\nWith a P/E multiple of 37, Broadcom is also reasonably priced compared to Nvidia, which trades for 51 times forward earnings, even though the latter company seems to have better growth prospects.\nWhile stock splits can create the illusion of affordability, they often can indicate the opposite. A stock split usually occurs after a company has already experienced extreme price appreciation. So, new investors aren't exactly getting a bargain deal. That said, over the long term, Nvidia and Broadcom still have what it takes to outperform the market. \nIn the near term, investors should consider the potential for volatility as the AI industry experiences its growing pains, just like the internet and other megatrends did historically. But between the two companies, Broadcom looks like the safer bet because of its lower valuation and greater diversification.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $830,777!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The three-day drop erased about $430 billion from Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization, the biggest three-day value loss for any company in history, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nShares fell 13% over the period, past the 10% threshold that represents a correction. The drop weighed on chipmakers with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index falling 3% on Monday. Broadcom Inc. fell 4% while Qualcomm Inc. dropped 5.5% and ARM Holdings Plc slumped 5.8%. US-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. shed 3.5%.\nThe drop put Nvidia\u2019s valuation back below the $3 trillion threshold, and under both Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. in size. Nvidia briefly claimed the title as the world\u2019s largest stock last week.\n\u201cIn the near-term, it is plausible that investors begin suffering from AI-fatigue or become more broadly concerned about index concentration,\u201d said Neville Javeri, portfolio manager and head of the Empiric LT Equity team at Allspring Global Investments.\nEven with the slump, Nvidia remains up nearly 140% this year, making it the second-best performer among S&P 500 Index components, behind Super Micro Computer Inc., another favorite AI play.\nThe stock suffered a drawdown of about 20% earlier this year, although it quickly returned to all-time highs.\nWhile investors have flocked to Nvidia given the sky-high demand for its chips used in AI processing, the scale of Nvidia\u2019s rally \u2014 it soared about 240% over the course of 2023 \u2014 has underlined concerns about its valuation. The stock trades at 21 times estimated sales over the next 12 months, making it the most expensive in the S&P 500 by this measure. Still, it remains well liked on Wall Street.

        "Author": "  Niamh Rowe ",
        "Text": "The astounding performance of a few tech companies is masking an otherwise mediocre stock market. The S&P 500 Index broke its 31st record of the year on Tuesday, closing at 5,487.03, according to Bloomberg data. While the index is up over 15% this year, that growth is by no means evenly shared.\nLooking at year-to-date data through June 18, shares of Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and Broadcom have on average soared by 25.3%, while the remaining 493 companies have grown by just 2.7%. In June alone, the \"Magnificent Seven\" (the previously cited list, swapping in Broadcom for Tesla) are on average up 7.5%, but the rest of the index is down -0.5%, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P. On Tuesday, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple stock equated to half of the index\u2019s total returns, he adds.\nThis unprecedented level of concentration is leaving some portfolio managers nervous. \u201cThey're biting their nails. Because the bottom line is, if you are not in this, you're not getting your return,\u201d Silverblatt told Fortune.\nhttps://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/B7gnW/4/\nThat\u2019s because the version of the index that makes no distinction between the market cap of the companies has grown just 4% this year. Moreover, the share of the S&P 500 stocks trading above their 50-day moving averages is declining, down to 47% on Monday from 92% in January, according to Bloomberg.\nThe darling of tech darlings remains Nvidia, which briefly became the world\u2019s most valuable company this week. With a market capitalization of about $3.1 trillion as of Friday morning, its stock is up over 170% year to date. At the peak of its frenzy on Tuesday, it was more valuable than the entire stock market of France or that of the U.K., or the whole oil and gas industry. That same day, one-third of the index\u2019s returns were from the company alone. \u201cIt\u2019s unheard of,\u201d says Silverblatt. \u201cThe closest we can get to that level of impact [on the index] from one company is IBM in the 1980s, when that new product, PCs, were coming out.\"\nSo, how long can this growth last? Silverblatt says he wouldn\u2019t bet his money on Nvidia generating these types of returns every year. For him, it\u2019s not a question of if it loses its chip monopoly, it's a matter of when. But, ultimately, whoever eventually usurps Nvidia is likely to be another tech company that needs chips: \u201cIt's going to stay in the family, shall we say.\u201d\nLooking more closely at IBM, in the early 1980s, it was topping the index and towering over competitors at a two-to-one ratio, according to the New York Times. By 1985, its portion of the index was 6.4%\u2014about equal to Apple\u2019s today. The company began to lose its monopoly over personal computers once Apple announced the Macintosh in 1984. Today, IBM ranks about 51st on the index, and represents just 0.35% of the weight. Its market cap is 5% that of Apple\u2019s.\nAdam Kobeissi, editor-in-chief of The Kobeissi Letter, told Fortune all waves of internet innovation \u201ctypically come with a bubble,\u201d and he anticipates there will be a pullback period in which weaker players are \u201cweeded out.\u201d Nonetheless, he predicts that the large-scale tech stocks are to remain the leaders of the market, and doesn't envision anyone dethroning Nvidia in the near term.\nSo, in the near term, is this level of disproportionality concerning?\nWell, the top three stocks alone can move the market significantly. \"Concentration is a risky situation\u201d and that makes \u201ceverybody nervous,\u201d adds Silverblatt. If, for example, Nvidia were to lose the gains it has made this year overnight, the S&P 500 would have to come down approximately 4.5%, according to his calculations. \u201cThe market's going to have to absorb that.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) -Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split aimed at luring retail investors has taken effect, sparking speculation over chances of the artificial intelligence bellwether's inclusion in the blue-chip Dow index.\nThe split, aimed at lowering per-share value to make it more affordable for employees and investors, increases the company's outstanding shares without changing its market valuation.\n\"A side-effect of Nvidia's stock split will be to put it in the running to follow Amazon and Apple into the Dow, potentially pushing out fellow chip stock Intel that currently has the lowest weighting,\" said Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at digital brokerage eToro.\nThe stock dipped 0.2% on Monday, after having climbed nearly 27% since the company announced the share split and a strong forecast last month. The dominant AI chip maker also clinched $3 trillion in market value last week and surpassed Apple to become the second-most valuable firm in the world, trailing only Microsoft.\n\"Historically, when we see runs like this into a split, there is often a hangover effect afterwards and I'd expect some buyer exhaustion this week,\" Dennis Dick, market structure analyst at Triple D Trading, said on Nvidia shares.\nMarket analysts said stock splits tend to attract individual investors that trade in smaller lots and have lesser capital to deploy than institutional investors.\nHowever, Goldman Sachs strategists led by David Kostin said in a note most recent stock splits have not generated a significant increase in retail trading activity, but there have been some notable exceptions such as Amazon's split in 2022 and Nvidia's 2021 split.\nMoreover, \"investors typically assign higher valuations to liquid stocks because of their low trading costs and flexibility in a variety of market environments\", the strategists said.\nOver the last several years, trading volumes have briefly increased following stock split announcements but evidenced little change during and after the splits took effect, according to Goldman's analysis of 45 Russell 1000 stock splits since 2019.\nNvidia's stock was last trading at $120 per share post-split, compared with $1,200 on Friday, making it a potential contender for the 30-member price-weighted Dow index.\nAn S&P Dow Jones Indices spokeswoman late in May said it does not comment or speculate on index additions or deletions.\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Pranav Kashyap and Arsheeya Bajwa; Editing by Devika Syamnath)\n"

The charge sheet \u2014 or statement of objections \u2014 would follow a raid of Nvidia offices last year.\nNvidia has drawn the attention of regulators since becoming the biggest beneficiary of the artificial intelligence spending boom. Its chips \u2014 known as graphics processing units, or GPUs \u2014 are prized by data center operators for their ability to crunch the massive amount of information required to develop AI models.\nThe French antitrust agency declined to comment to Bloomberg, as did Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia.\nNvidia shares slipped as much as 3.8% on Monday in New York before mostly recovering. They have more than doubled this year, pushing the company\u2019s valuation above $3 trillion.\nIn September, French antitrust enforcers raided the offices of a business suspected of engaging in \u201canticompetitive practices in the graphics cards sector.\u201d They didn\u2019t identify the company as Nvidia at the time, but the chipmaker has since acknowledged that France and other entities are examining its business practices.\nOfficials in the US, European Union, China and the UK are also scrutinizing its operations, Nvidia said in a filing in February.\n\u201cOur position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide,\u201d the chipmaker said at the time.\nFrench antitrust watchdogs have been interviewing market players on Nvidia\u2019s key role in AI processors, its pricing policy, the shortage of chips and the impact on prices. The office raid was aimed at gleaning more information on potential abuses of dominance.\nFines for breaching France\u2019s antitrust law can be as high as 10% of a company\u2019s global annual revenue. The agency lists a \u20ac1.24 billion ($1.33 billion) fine from 2020 as its largest since 2011. Of that, \u20ac1.1 billion was imposed on Apple Inc., while the rest was levied against two distributors.\nIn Brussels, the European Commission has been informally gathering views on whether Nvidia may have also run afoul of its own antitrust rules, but it has yet to launch a formal probe into anticompetitive conduct.\nIn November, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that Nvidia\u2019s dominance was causing \u201cgrowing inequalities\u201d between countries and stifling fair competition. He said that 92% of GPUs are from Nvidia.\n\u201cIf you want to have fair competition, you need to have many private companies and not one single company having the possibility of selling all the devices,\u201d Le Maire said.\n--With assistance from Mackenzie Hawkins and Alan Katz.\n(Updates with more on raid starting in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing\nFor Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate\nThe Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before\nOnline Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Jon Quast, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In May 2017, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was interviewed in the MIT Technology Review when he said, \"Software is eating the world, but AI is going to eat software.\" This week, Nvidia briefly became the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of over $3.3 trillion, before closing Friday just a little behind Microsoft and Apple. In short, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has produced eye-popping financial results for the business, igniting incredible gains for the stock.\nNvidia is undeniably an AI juggernaut. Huang was ahead of the trend, developing both hardware and software for AI long before there was strong demand. In other words, Nvidia was ready for AI well before its time in the spotlight.\nThat time finally came once OpenAI launched its ChatGPT product in late 2022. Generative AI applications were suddenly at the forefront of everyone's imagination, and businesses quickly felt the need to do something or risk getting left behind.\nThe chart below shows that since the launch of ChatGPT, Nvidia's revenue and net income have skyrocketed -- to say nothing of its stock price.\nTo emphasize what's important here, Nvidia had a net income margin of 57% during its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended in April). That's astronomically high for any business in any industry, let alone a company that generates substantial revenue from selling semiconductor hardware.\nThe chart below further illustrates just how high Nvidia's profits are (in green):\nTherefore, it's evident that Nvidia has a competitive advantage, giving it pricing power. Its customers are willing to pay exorbitant prices because they simply must get their hands on its chips to stay relevant in the AI race.\nIn light of this situation, here are some things investors should think about.\nThere's a difference between a competitive advantage and a competitive moat. When a business has an advantage, it can profit more than its competitors. But unless it also has a moat, the benefit could be short-lived.\nOn one hand, it does seem Nvidia has something special. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are essential to powering and training AI models. Companies such as Meta Platforms and Microsoft are among Nvidia's largest customers. And even though the company didn't directly confirm they are its biggest customers, Nvidia's top-two customers accounted for 13% and 11% of Q1 revenue of $26 billion.\nThese are some of the most important tech companies in the world. If they're willing to spend this much on Nvidia's products, then those products must be high-performance and high-quality.\nOn the other hand, Nvidia's current pricing power might have more to do with supply and demand than product quality. After all, Nvidia is a first mover here so it's been able to supply GPUs better than most as demand skyrocketed. But the biggest tech companies have deep pockets and are developing their own solutions.\nInvestors, therefore, need to answer two questions. First, will demand for AI hardware and software continue to grow? And second, will Nvidia be able to maintain its dominant position in the industry?\nIf overall demand drops or if other companies take market share, then Nvidia could lose some of its valuable pricing power. It wouldn't become irrelevant, but those astronomical profit margins could normalize.\nAs mentioned, Nvidia generates substantial revenue from hardware, although the exact number is opaque -- management breaks revenue out by end market, not by source. However, the company strategically prioritizes software too, which could also be driving results under the hood.\nFor one example, Nvidia offers a software language called CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), and in 2023, 4.7 million developers were using it. This software framework unlocks the true power of Nvidia's GPUs. If a business is using Nvidia's hardware and wants to do things such as machine learning or data mining, CUDA is often necessary to that effort.\nThis could provide a degree of incentive to choose Nvidia GPUs over similar products from competitors. If developers are accustomed to Nvidia's software offerings and frameworks, they may be reluctant to switch and learn new systems. This could support continued demand for Nvidia because it's the ecosystem so many developers are used to.\nCombine this edge in software and services with the top-tier performance of its GPUs, and you get a fuller picture of how Nvidia has leveraged its leadership in AI to become the world's most valuable company.\nAs long as this is the reality, Nvidia stock should continue to outperform. And the longer this is true, the more likely its advantage is actually a moat. However, if its current advantage is only temporary, then its profits could come back down to earth, much to the surprise of many of today's investors. This is why it's so important for Nvidia's shareholders and prospective investors to form an opinion on this subject.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has soared over the past few years, advancing a whopping 1,900% since the start of 2020. The reason is simple. The technology company has established itself as the go-to artificial intelligence (AI) chip company, taking 80% market share. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the fastest around, and companies launching AI projects are rushing to buy these and other Nvidia AI products and services.\nAll this has resulted in massive gains in earnings for Nvidia, with sales and net income increasing in the triple digits quarter after quarter. In the most recent quarter, revenue hit a record high of $26 billion, and the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Meanwhile, Nvidia's shares continue to climb and even roared past $1,000. As a result, Nvidia did something it's never done before.\nThis first-ever event has to do with market value. For the first time, Nvidia's market capitalization reached $3 trillion, sending it higher than Apple and making it the U.S.'s second-biggest company after Microsoft. That happened earlier this week, and Nvidia's value has dipped a bit since, putting it slightly behind Apple again.\nBut this movement isn't just a random happening. It says something about where Nvidia's at today and what may be down the road. It's part of the general momentum that's been picking up speed since last year, when Nvidia became a $1 trillion company. Then earlier this year, Nvidia's market value reached the $2 trillion mark, and now, the company is showing that it has what it takes to share the spotlight with stock market giant Apple.\nThis trend is positive because it's been accompanied by earnings growth from Nvidia and bright long-term forecasts -- solid reasons for the market value gains to last.\nAs mentioned earlier, Nvidia has become a key player in the AI market, offering companies tools that could determine whether or not their AI projects are successful. Today, Nvidia's H100 is the top chip on the market, but the company isn't sitting on its laurels and has instead promised rapid innovation. It's preparing to ship the H200 -- which almost doubles the inferencing performance of the H100 -- this quarter, and later this year Nvidia will release the much-awaited Blackwell architecture and its best-performing chip yet.\nBeyond chips, Nvidia also offers a range of other tools and services, including an enterprise software platform that streamlines the development of AI programs. And Nvidia's products and services are available through all public cloud providers, making access easy for any potential customer.\nIn more good news, which offers us visibility on the months to come, Nvidia says demand for its products is surpassing supply -- and the company expects this to continue into next year. This offers us reason to be optimistic about earnings in the near term. And Nvidia's market position, ongoing innovation, and general growth forecasts for the AI market offer us reason to be optimistic about earnings over the long term, too. Analysts expect the AI market to reach $1 trillion by the end of the decade, so we're in the early days of this growth story.\nExcitement about Nvidia's June 7 stock split may have pushed the stock higher this week, lifting the company's market value. But stock splits are mechanical operations that don't represent real catalysts for share performance, so this won't be a driving force for ongoing gains. That's OK, though, because earnings should do that job.\nWith Nvidia's earnings strength today and outlook for more of the same down the road, the company may maintain its market value spot next to Apple -- a company that has also built its reputation on innovation, is a leader in its field, and has delivered long-term earnings growth.\nWhether Nvidia's market value remains under $3 trillion and slightly under that of Apple or moves higher, I consider this tech giant one of today's top growth companies -- and a solid stock to buy and hold for the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "In the blockbuster 1997 movie Titanic, the character played by Leonardo DiCaprio stood on the bow of the ship and proclaimed, \"I'm the king of the world!\" Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is having that kind of a moment.\nThe company recently reported first-quarter revenue of $26 billion, up 262% year over year and a record high. Its earnings soared 628% to nearly $14.9 billion. Nvidia raised its quarterly dividend by 150%. It announced a highly anticipated 10-for-1 stock split. And its stock has skyrocketed more than 170% over the last 12 months.\nNvidia truly is the king of the artificial intelligence (AI) world right now in several ways. However, as the Titanic movie showed, king-of-the-world moments can be fleeting. Nvidia could have a better fate, though.\nRalph Waldo Emerson is widely credited as saying, \"Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.\" He probably never stated those exact words, but the sentiment rings true. We're seeing it fulfilled with Nvidia.\nThere's no question that the world is beating a path to Nvidia's door. Every major cloud service provider uses Nvidia's GPUs to train and run AI apps. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted in the company's Q1 earnings press release, \"Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\" And these companies are buying Nvidia's chips, too.\nIt's not just tech giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon that are flocking to Nvidia. Huang said in the company's Q1 earnings call that between 15,000 and 20,000 start-ups are Nvidia customers. He added, \"[T]he list is just quite extraordinary.\"\nWhy is all of this happening? Nvidia has built a better mousetrap. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and xAI (both Nvidia customers), summed it up, \"There is currently nothing better than Nvidia hardware for AI.\"\nNvidia's past and current success doesn't guarantee future success. But the biggest reason why the company (and stock) could keep the momentum going for years to come is its pace of innovation.\nHuang pointed to Nvidia's \"one-year rhythm\" in the Q1 call. The company expects to launch new and improved AI chips every year. While there's no shortage of rivals trying to take market share away from Nvidia, it's going to be very difficult for them to keep up with the GPU maker's speed in delivering new technology.\nNvidia will launch its Blackwell platform later in 2024. Blackwell's architecture will support four times faster training of generative AI models with 30 times faster inference than Nvidia's H100 GPUs. The platform will also have a 25x lower total cost of ownership (TCO) than the company's Hopper chips.\nNo other chipmaker has technology that matches Blackwell. And Huang promised that more powerful chips would follow rapidly after Blackwell. Nvidia could keep its momentum going by continually building better mousetraps. If it can do so, the world will continue beating a path to its door.\nWhile it will be difficult for competitors to beat Nvidia, it's not impossible. Although Musk is a fan of the company's GPUs, he also predicted on X (formerly known as Twitter) last year, \"Nvidia will not have a monopoly on large-scale training & inference forever.\" He's probably right.\nThe currently sizzling demand for AI chips could also fizzle. Perhaps a major economic downturn could cause companies to slash their technology investments. Maybe AI won't deliver enough return on investment to justify the costs.\nIf any of these scenarios play out, Nvidia's momentum would almost certainly be derailed. However, I don't have a sinking feeling about the company's prospects. Instead, I suspect that Nvidia will remain king of the AI world at least through the end of this decade and probably beyond.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Perhaps no stock has become more popular in recent months than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The graphics-processing-unit (GPU) maker has become the world's largest semiconductor stock by market cap as demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips explodes.\nNonetheless, no stock rises continuously, and investors should consider whether that growth can continue. Hence, investors should look at the company's upcoming product releases and financials and determine whether the stock remains a buy at current levels.\nUndoubtedly, the demand for AI chips has redefined Nvidia. As recently as three years ago, gaming was the company's largest source of revenue. However, demand for its data center chips surged higher as more workloads moved to the cloud.\nDuring this time, Nvidia took the lead in AI-ready chips. This paid off hugely for the company when investors discovered that OpenAI's ChatGPT used Nvidia's AI chips.\nSince then, demand has exceeded Nvidia's ability to keep pace. Additionally, even though competitors such as AMD, Qualcomm, and Intel have developed AI chips, Nvidia holds a substantial technical lead.\nMoreover, Allied Market Research predicts the AI chip market will grow at a 38% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2032. It projects only a 6% CAGR for the overall chip market through 2031, which should make Nvidia the most critical chip company for years to come.\nNot surprisingly, Nvidia's financials are on fire as a result. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 28), revenue was $26 billion, a 262% increase from year-ago levels. The data center segment, which produces its AI chips, was 87% of Nvidia's revenue.\nAlso, its cost of revenue and operating expenses grew at a significantly slower pace than revenue. This resulted in almost $15 billion in net income for fiscal Q1, up from just over $2 billion during the same quarter last year.\nThe increases should continue as Nvidia predicts around $28 billion in revenue in fiscal Q2, more than doubling the $13.5 billion reported during Q2 of fiscal 2024. Thus, shareholders are probably optimistic considering the recent 10-for-1 stock split and the 190% stock-price gain over the last year.\nHowever, valuations should give investors pause. The company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 74 may not seem expensive, given the recent earnings growth. Nonetheless, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 39 appears frothy, considering that the average P/S ratio for the S&P 500 is less than 3.\nMoreover, Nvidia stock sells at an astounding 63 times the company's book value. By comparison, AMD's price-to-book value ratio is less than 5. Even with Nvidia's impressive growth, one might hesitate to pay such multiples, given that any bad news (or even good news that's not impressive) could send the stock plunging.\nConsidering Nvidia's elevated valuation, investors should add the company's shares slowly if they choose to buy at all. Undoubtedly, AI chips are the future of the chip industry, and with Nvidia's dominance, it will likely remain the top semiconductor company for some time to come.\nUnfortunately for investors, the unprecedented demand for Nvidia's chips also seems to extend to its stock, which has arguably become priced for perfection. Even though high expectations have not deterred Nvidia investors in recent quarters, any disappointment could cause the stock to plunge. Hence, any aggressive moves into the stock should probably wait for now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

From packing a 4,000-seat sports stadium to paparazzi-fueled night-market jaunts, the leather jacket-clad CEO and his $3 trillion company drew the largest audiences and biggest entourages.\nAs icing on the cake, the 61-year-old this week joined the likes of Elon Musk in a select group of business chieftains worth at least $100 billion, riding a $315 billion Nvidia market rally over three frantic days.\n\u201cSomeone coined the term Jensanity, and that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s been,\u201d said Dan Nystedt, an analyst at TriOrient Investments.\nYet observers who navigate past Nvidia\u2019s (very large) wake can spot trends that may in time determine the direction in which AI evolves around the world. This year, \u201cAI PCs\u201d mushroomed across the cavernous showfloors; hitherto-unknown Taiwanese names became stars; Microsoft Corp. software was ubiquitous in presentations and exhibition booths; and many tech honchos studiously avoided talking China, sanctions or politics.\nHere\u2019s what we learned at the largest Computex ever.\nIt\u2019s Jensen\u2019s World...\nNvidia\u2019s star grew even more ascendant this week, thanks to its dominant share of the market for the high-end accelerators used to train AI.\nHuang was easy to spot on the show floor at all times \u2014 observers could literally tell where he was from the cheering, chanting and visible, moving mass of people that track the CEO wherever he goes. When not touring the booths, he hosted dinners for CEOs and cameo-ed at partner events. He signed Super Micro servers, journalists\u2019 laptops and - in a video that went viral - one young lady\u2019s chest.\nMany credit Huang\u2019s company for putting Taiwan and Computex on the map. Just a year ago, the co-founder urged one audience of Taiwanese students to \u201crun, don\u2019t walk\u201d to embrace AI. This year, Huang was racing so hard he didn\u2019t get breakfast one day until 3:30 pm when he munched on a turkey sandwich \u2014 onstage while speaking to the crowd.\nNvidia today commands an ecosystem of software, hardware and solutions that rivals from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to Intel are trying hard to break up or replicate. \u201cIt\u2019s almost becoming Nvidia against the world,\u201d said Ian Cutress of the consultancy More Than Moore.\nBut one little-understood fact about Nvidia is that its success hinges in no small part on the hundreds of companies that together make AI possible \u2014 many of them based in Taiwan.\nBut He Too Pays his Respects\nTaiwan sent a message with this year\u2019s raucous Computex: If you want AI, you need Taiwan.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. made the island a compulsory stop for governments around the world trying to secure chips. But there\u2019s more to AI than just the chip: motherboards, modules, servers, cooling systems and more are all mostly designed and initially made in Taiwan. More than nine-tenths of the world\u2019s AI-capable servers are made by the island\u2019s firms, Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Steven Tseng estimates, operating out of factories spanning Mexico to Malaysia.\nAs the world rushes to build out data centers to cope with the AI rush, that supply chain is coming into focus. That\u2019s why this week the marquee names actively courted the bosses of companies like Wiwynn Corp., Quanta Computer Inc., Inventec Corp., Pegatron Corp. and more. Most of those are barely known outside of Taiwan. Yet Jensen Huang, AMD\u2019s Lisa Su, and Intel\u2019s Gelsinger were just a few of the bigwigs who toured their booths, signed their hardware and took their bosses out to dinner. Huang in his press conference called them the \u201cunsung heroes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat Jensen is doing - running around with all these people - is a sign that the Taiwan electronic components and server-maker ecosystems hold a key position in the global supply chain. When companies start building things, they are still going to the Taiwanese first because of long-standing working relationships and the one-stop shop that Taiwan offers,\u201d said Jon Yu, an analyst and founder of the Asianometry YouTube channel. \u201cThe system integrators then make many of the critical decisions on components that make or break whole companies.\u201d\nAmong the many things Taiwanese companies specialize in is the design and fabrication of laptops. Which brings us to...\nWhat the Heck is an AI PC?\nThis year\u2019s buzz centered on AI PCs. The only problem is, no one can quite agree on what they are.\nFrom Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s Cristiano Amon to AMD\u2019s Lisa Su, just about every executive extolled the benefits of having AI computations performed on the laptop \u2014 the edge \u2014 rather than via a remote cloud server. But things get squishy after that.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their own definition of AI PCs, and that\u2019s to promote their products,\u201d Johnson Hua, a senior manager of marketing at Kioxia, said frankly.\nA Gigabyte Technology Co. representative argued such a device must have a motherboard that supports the latest components (spoiler alert: Gigabyte makes motherboards). Asustek Computer Inc. said it\u2019s a device that helps people work more efficiently. It should have the latest generation CPU, Acer Inc. says. Thing is, much of that sounds pretty much exactly like a high-end laptop.\nWesley Kuo, CEO of Nvidia-backed cloud-based AI services firm Ubitus, said the concept was \u201ca joke.\u201d It will take years for a device to run \u201cacceptable native AI.\u201d\nCase in point: Shao Yu, an Acer product manager, said she couldn\u2019t demonstrate some of the functions because the venue\u2019s internet was too slow.\nNo Politics Please, We\u2019re Tech\nGeopolitical uncertainty has been a dominant topic at conferences around the world. In Taipei, every mention drew either the evil eye or a nervous laugh and brush-off.\nJust weeks ago, the People\u2019s Liberation Army held military exercises around the island after its new president\u2019s inauguration. Around the show floor, the topic of China rarely came up, even though it\u2019s a deciding factor in local elections and arguably one of the biggest priorities for a Washington administration seeking to shore up the US lead in high technology.\nAt Computex, it might as well all be a fever dream. At a media Q&A, Huang asked for a \u201chappy\u201d last question. The lucky local journalist who got picked chose to ask about geopolitics.\nThe reporter \u201cis not well. As the last question before we all leave, she would like to ask about geopolitical stuff,\u201d Huang said, miming displeasure.\nFarewell, PC\nMicrosoft is the unseen guiding hand behind this exuberant celebration of tech. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri did the rounds as a guest speaker at the major keynote events. CEO Satya Nadella gave video endorsements to each chipmaking partner. And Qualcomm\u2019s CEO wore white sneakers prominently sporting Microsoft\u2019s Copilot logo.\nIf there was any coherence to the message coming out from competing companies, it came from Microsoft. The Windows maker is betting billions on ushering in a new AI age.\nThe excitement around AI is understandable given the PC market has been either flat or in decline for close to a decade. One thing everyone in Taipei this week could agree on \u2014 the industry was entering uncharted territory, with uncertain outcomes for all. \u201cThis is the most consequential time of our careers,\u201d Gelsinger said.\n(Updates with an analyst\u2019s comment in the 10th paragraph.

It is now worth nearly $3 trillion, having added more than $2 trillion of that since a landmark earnings report sent its stock into the stratosphere last year.\nThe day after Nvidia unveiled its latest chip plans, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said it\u2019s speeding up introductions of its own.

But so far the naysayers keep being proven wrong.\nTake Rob Arnott, who\u2019s been warning of a Nvidia bubble since at least September. He compares its rise to other tech darlings that shot to glory only to see their products\u2019 relevance evaporate: the PalmPilot overshadowed by the BlackBerry, which, in turn, was annihilated by the iPhone.

Fantastic. How long does that persist?\u201d\nOthers express a mixture of worry and surprise at Nvidia\u2019s success, but say they cannot help but be buyers of the stock. For instance, JP Scandalios, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Franklin Equity Group, gets a little rattled when friends or Uber drivers or barbers want to talk to him about Nvidia \u2014 that type of enthusiasm usually puts him on guard.

The numbers have just become staggering very quickly.\u201d\nClimbing Estimates\nAnalysts expect Nvidia\u2019s net income to jump to $65 billion, on average, in the current fiscal year from $30 billion the year before, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Those projections have risen 10% in just the past month.\nImportantly, Nvidia is not just growing profits but profit margins, showing its pricing power as revenue shoots higher. Analysts expect Nvidia\u2019s gross margin \u2014 the percentage of revenue that remains after production costs \u2014 to rise to 76% this fiscal year, up from 59% two years ago.\nWhile Nvidia shares are relatively pricey at 39 times profits expected over the next 12 months, they are much less expensive than the multiple of 60 they were trading at before its May 2023 earnings report.\nThe ratio change is a function of analysts\u2019 profit estimates rising even faster than the stock. That makes Nvidia attractive compared with other big tech names like Microsoft Corp., which is priced at 32 times future earnings, said Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading.\n\u201cFor a similar valuation, you\u2019re getting so much greater growth with Nvidia,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no competition for that kind of fundamental growth in a megacap company.\u201d\nOf the 72 analysts tracked by Bloomberg who cover Nvidia\u2019s stock, 65 rate it a buy and none rate it a sell.\nEven Arnott, the Nvidia bear, describes it as \u201ca wonderful company with phenomenal products.\u201d He just can\u2019t help feeling like he\u2019s seen this movie before.\n\u201cBubbles continue until they don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best thing to do in a bubble is stay the course, ride with the herd as long as you know when the bull is going to signal.

        "Title": "Nvidia becomes the world's most valuable company, but will somebody please think about poor old PC gamers?",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Laird ",
        "Text": "Remember when Nvidia just made gaming graphics cards? Hard to imagine many at the company do as Nvidia yesterday achieved the remarkable status of \"world's most valuable company\", overtaking Apple and Microsoft.\nThat's nice and all, but will somebody please think about PC gamers? Actually, Dave put pretty much that very question directly to His Royal Leather Jacketness, AKA Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, after Nvidia's recent Computex keynote. But hold that thought while we cover off some details. That valuation is based on Nvidia's current share price and thus market capitalisation.\nObviously, such valuations can change pretty quickly. How long Nvidia will retain its new crown is anyone's guess. But as of market close yesterday, Nvidia's share price of $135.58 works out to a market capitalisation of $3.335 trillion. Yes, trillion.\nOf course, both Apple and Microsoft are also worth over $3 trillion in market cap terms. So, it's more a case of a trio of titans than Nvidia being in a class of its own. Its status as the most valuable company on paper is pretty notional if not ephemeral. But still, the symbolism of this development is significant.\nIt is, of course, all driven by Nvidia's success in AI. Exactly how that plays out in future is hard to say. Will Nvidia continue to dominate? Will the likes of Microsoft and Google succeed in building their own AI chips, reducing their dependence on Nvidia?\nMight the whole AI thing turn out to be a bit of a ruse? Who knows, though it's worth recalling how quickly cryptocurrency mining came and went as a driver of demand for Nvidia GPUs. What we can say is that we remember the early days of what Nvidia used to call GPGPU or general purpose computing on graphics chips and how that slowly transitioned into the AI juggernaut we have today.\nFunnily enough, for years and years nary a mention did Nvidia make of AI. They talked about things like physics simulation, prospecting for fossil fuels, folding proteins, that kind of thing.\nThe notion of running AI on its GPUs is a relatively recent phenomenon. So, don't believe claims that Nvidia saw this all coming. For sure, the company put the time and effort into parallel computing on GPUs that no other company could be bothered with. So, Nvidia deserves this success. But when it started off down a road originally called GPGPU, Nvidia didn't see AI coming.\nOf course, when that journey began Nvidia was very much a gaming graphics company. These days, Nvidia likes to style gaming graphics as merely the first application it happened upon for its massively parallel approach to compute.\nPersonally, I think that's a rewriting of history given that Nvidia's early graphics chips were pretty much pure fixed-function raster hardware with virtually no general purpose compute capacity. But history is written by the victorious, so fighting that battle is a guaranteed loss.\nMore of a concern is Nvidia's current attitude to PC gaming. No question, the company continues to invest in gaming graphics, and heavily. The problem is that most of the focus seems to be going into the software side in the shape of its DLSS suite of largely AI-accelerated rendering enhancements including upscaling and frame generation.\nFor sure, those technologies can be pretty magical. But you could also argue they are being used to deprecate the importance of \u00a0the actual hardware. That's why the pure rasterisation power of many of Nvidia's latest RTX 40 series GPUs were relatively disappointing. Nvidia now relies to a greater and greater degree on those clever AI features to deliver higher frame rates.\nMeanwhile, despite Intel's recent efforts the competition which amounts pretty much exclusively to AMD, which has struggled to compete with Nvidia's DLSS feature set and quality. In that regard, AMD is always a step behind and playing catch up.\nIf you take something like AMD's Radeon RX 7800 XT GPU, it's extremely competitive for plain old raster performance. But falls ever further behind as soon as you start factoring in fancier features.\nOf course, Nvidia isn't entirely neglecting the hardware. It's been iterating its ray tracing GPU technology for three generations now, another area where it has a clear advantage over AMD.\nBut Nvidia's shift in emphasis is clear enough. AMD can compete when it comes to conventional pixel pumping. But Nvidia's huge advantage in AI is something that no company can currently match. So, that's where Nvidia seems to be putting the emphasis with its gaming GPUs.\nAs for the future, there's no reason to think Nvidia is going to actually ditch gaming graphics. But it's probably a safe bet to assume that the company will increasingly view gaming through the lens of AI. And that will likely be a blessing and a curse.\nYour next machine\nBest gaming PC: The top pre-built machines. Best gaming laptop: Great devices for mobile gaming.\nThe blessings will be even more remarkable additions to the DLSS family of image-enhancing technologies. The curse will be an even less competitive landscape for gaming graphics where Nvidia can dictate the market to an even greater degree.\nThat explains why, if true, Nvidia has very modest plans for its next generation of GPUs in pure hardware terms. If the rumours are to be believed, some members of the next-gen RTX 50 series will actually see regression in terms of things like shader core counts, while memory availability and bus widths look set to stagnate for yet another generation.\nIf that happens, it'll be pretty depressing and again it will all comes back to AI. So as a PC gamer, and despite how magical some of Nvidia's gaming technologies undoubtedly are, it's hard not to feel a little uneasy about Nvidia's new status as the world's most valuable company. It's a huge win for Nvidia, but what it means for PC gaming is a lot more ambiguous.\n"

Microsoft, meanwhile, which became the world\u2019s most valuable company in January when it took the title from Apple (AAPL), dipped slightly, putting its market cap at $3.317 trillion.\nNvidia stock's meteoric rise has coincided with the company's ascent from a leading maker of graphics processing units used primarily in gaming computers to the undisputed leader in the market for AI semiconductors.\nIts value has increased more than tenfold since October 2022, right before the release of ChatGPT sparked the AI frenzy that has gripped markets for over a year and a half.\nNvidia became only the seventh U.S. company to close with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion late last May.

        "Text": "Investors can\u2019t get enough of a firm at the vanguard of a hot new tech sector. More and more people rush in to buy shares until the firm outstrips Microsoft and becomes the most valuable company in the world. This storyline describes the meteoric journey of AI chipmaker Nvidia. But it also could have been written a quarter-century ago when networking-gear maker Cisco\u2014currently No. 74 on the Fortune 500 list\u2014leapfrogged Microsoft to become No. 1 in market cap.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on the parallel this week, noting that the rise of Nvidia\u2014whose share price has soared nearly 30,000% in the past decade\u2014is reminiscent of the dotcom era when the hot new tech was not AI, but the internet. That era ended with a thud as the tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell over 50% in the year 2000 as Cisco and other once-hot stocks came down to earth. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the current Nvidia-led boom will end in tears, too, though some are getting antsy.\n\u201cThe insatiable flow of money into AI has raised eyebrows among investors uncertain the boom can continue without pause. Some $50 billion has been invested in Nvidia\u2019s chips since the boom began, according to a Sequoia Capital estimate in March, but generative-AI startups have only brought in $3 billion in sales,\u201d the Journal reported.\nThere are other reasons to believe Nvidia\u2014along with other AI-tied stocks riding its coattails\u2014is overvalued. As Fortune recently noted, the company\u2019s current P/E multiple\u2014a key valuation metric that looks at share price in light of earnings\u2014is well over 100. This is way, way beyond the typical P/E for even a growth stock. For Nvidia to justify that multiple, it will have to post a long series of blow-it-out-of-the-water earnings reports of the sort no company has delivered before. A more likely outcome is its share price drops to reflect its actual earnings\u2014and the broader market follows suit.\nRobin Greenwood, a finance professor at Harvard Business School, says there are \u201ccertainly some echoes\u201d in the current market to what took place in the dotcom era. But does this mean the outcome will be the same?\nThe nature of stock market bubbles is that they are much easier to see in hindsight. History shows that, in the midst of a boom, investors are more likely to be mesmerized by returns that keep climbing higher. That was the case in the internet-fueled dotcom bubble of 2000, and it was the case in 2008 when a proliferation of mortgage-backed securities drove stock indexes to new heights.\nWilliam Goetzmann, a finance professor at Yale School of Management, has studied the history of stock market bubbles\u2014including the first one: the South Sea Bubble of 1720, when investors in London, Paris, and Amsterdam bid up shares in hopes of cashing in on a new era of overseas colonization. Eventually, the price paid for shares became untethered to economic reality, and a brutal crash ensued.\nGoetzmann has an interesting twofold take on the South Sea Bubble and others that followed. The first is that, even though investors incurred heavy losses, share prices did not drop to pre-bubble levels. This, he says, reflects the fact that many of the companies selling shares were indeed helping to carry out a transformational change in society and the economy.\nThe same is true of the 2000 dotcom boom when Cisco and others were racing to bring broadband internet to millions of people and businesses. And while the 2008 boom was not based on a foundational new technology, it was fueled by novel forms of financialization that made it easier to divide and distribute investments.\n\u201cWhen you see something that looks like a bubble, as an economist, I always look at the innovation associated with it. How\u2019s it going to change the way money is made or the way business is done?\u201d Goetzmann says.\nAs for Nvidia\u2019s soaring share price, he observes that \u201cclearly there\u2019s anticipation there will be another transformation\u201d\u2014this one based on AI changing daily life as much as the internet did 25 years ago. In this context, it\u2019s no surprise investors are rushing into Nvidia even if there is likely some pain ahead.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 10 Years?",
        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If you put $10,000 in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock 10 years ago, you would have $2.74 million today -- a life-changing return of over 27,400%. Over that time frame, the company has experienced several boom-and-bust cycles based on demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). Let's dig deeper into what the next decade could have in store.\nHistorically, Nvidia has experienced several boom-and-bust cycles based on macroeconomic factors and industry dynamics outside its control. Soon after its initial public offering (IPO) in 1999, the company enjoyed explosive growth based on demand for its GPUs for personal computers and video game consoles like Microsoft's Xbox.\nThese are now somewhat mature and highly cyclical markets because they rely on nonessential discretionary spending that can be cut in challenging economic conditions. But by 2010, Nvidia was rescued by a brand-new industry: cryptocurrency mining.\nBlockchain platforms like Bitcoin (and previously Ethereum) run on a system called proof-of-work, where transactions are validated, and new blocks created by solving complex computational puzzles (mining). Nvidia's consumer GPUs were ideal for these tasks, leading to booming sales for much of the 2010s and some of the 2020s. \nBut now, Nvidia has finally gotten its big break with generative artificial intelligence (AI), an opportunity so massive, it has made the company's other business verticals practically irrelevant. \nFor better or worse, Nvidia has become almost a pure play on data center AI hardware, with its other segments fading into irrelevance. In the first quarter, data center sales represented 87% of the company's $26 billion in revenue, while the once-core gaming and PC segment (which includes cryptocurrency mining rigs) has fallen to just 10%.\nNvidia's poor diversification will likely worsen because the data center segment is growing significantly faster than its other businesses. This dynamic makes the company vulnerable to a potential slowdown in demand for AI chips, which is a significant risk over the coming decade.\nEven if the overall industry meets analysts' lofty expectations (Bloomberg expects generative AI to be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032), there may eventually be chip overcapacity as data centers accumulate massive stockpiles of GPUs and feel less need to update to the latest versions. And like in Nvidia's previous boom-and-bust cycles, used chips could erode the market for its new products, leading to lower pricing power and margins. \nThat said, Nvidia is a company that constantly reinvents itself. Few would have expected the video game chipmaker to dominate cryptocurrency mining and eventually generative AI. In the future, new markets such as self-driving car technology, robotics, or warehouse automation could reignite demand for Nvidia's products and rediversify its customer base. \nNvidia stock still looks capable of outperforming the S&P 500 over the next 10 years -- especially as the AI industry expands out of simple chatbots into more advanced-use cases. That said, the stock has become incredibly risky in the near term because of its overreliance on data center GPUs and the threat of overcapacity in its market. \nInvestors who buy now should be ready to ride through a potential correction. But the better idea might be to hold and wait for more information. \nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) supply the computational horsepower that underpins AI, pushing the stock to greater heights, resulting in a high-profile stock split.\nIn a keynote address this past weekend ahead of the Computex trade show in Taiwan, CEO Jensen Huang laid out Nvidia's game plan for the next couple of years, which made one Wall Street analyst even more bullish.\nBank of America analyst Vivek Arya called Nvidia a \"top pick,\" reiterating his buy rating on the stock and raising his price target to $1,500. That represents potential gains for investors of 37% over the coming year compared to the stock's closing price on Friday.\n\"Our company has a one-year rhythm,\" Huang said. \"Our basic philosophy is very simple: Build the entire data center scale, disaggregate and sell to you parts on a one-year rhythm, and push everything to technology limits.\"\nThe analyst noted that with this statement, Nvidia is essentially accelerating its product upgrade cycle from two years to one year. This will \"continue to bolster Nvidia's AI leadership position,\" according to Arya.\nThe evidence suggests the analyst is on to something. During his keynote, Huang said Nvidia planned to unveil a Blackwell Ultra processor in 2025, with its next-generation Rubin platform slated for release in 2026. The first Blackwell processors are slated for delivery beginning later this year, replacing the wildly popular Hopper generative AI chips.\nThis relentless pace of innovation keeps Nvidia ahead of the competition. In its fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), the company spent nearly $8.68 billion -- more than 14% of its total revenue -- on research and development. This has helped Nvidia maintain its sizable technological lead on its rivals, which shouldn't be changing anytime soon.\nNvidia stock is selling for 42 times forward earnings, a premium that's supported its triple-digit revenue growth, making the stock a buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nKey drivers of this explosive growth include Nvidia's H100 products, with the next generation of artificial intelligence products expected from the H200, Blackwell and InfiniBand and Ethernet solutions. The H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of the H100, a crucial factor as AI growth shifts from training to inference stages, where superior inference performance could lower the total cost of AI deployments for enterprise customers. The company's price gains are not solely based on the irrational positive sentiment on generative AI, but are matched by extraordinary earnings and revenue growth. IT has recorded three consecutive quarters of over 200% revenue growth, while profits increased by 628% year over year, as recorded in the most recent earnings release.\nFigure 1: Nvidia has consistently beaten consensus expectations over the last four quarters\nSources: Schwab and Nvidia investor relations\nNvidia's recent strategic initiatives, including a dividend increase and a proposed 10-to-1 stock split, indicate further positive developments on its outlook, potentially driving it to outperform in 2024 and 2025. The upcoming stock split is anticipated to boost momentum in the short term as it will be more accessible to retail investors, potentially leading to a significant increase in the stock price.\nFigure 2: Nvidia income statement (FY21-FY24)\nSource: GuruFocus\nIn fiscal 2024, Nvidia reported unprecedented financial results, underscoring its leadership in the accelerated computing and generative AI sectors. The company achieved a record revenue of $60.90 billion, reflecting an extraordinary 126% year-over-year growth - a testament to its successful penetration and dominance in a market experiencing explosive demand across various sectors and geographies. Nvidia's earnings per share figures highlight its exceptional profitability and growth trajectory, with the GAAP diluted earnings soaring to $11.93, a remarkable 586% surge from the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes certain non-recurring items, the earnings per share reached $12.96, marking an impressive 288% increase.\nNvidia's industry, characterized by rapid technological advancements and expanding applications of AI, positions it for sustained high growth. The company has achieved a staggering rate of earnings per share growth, significantly outpacing its 10-year average of 34.30%. Given the dynamic landscape and increasing adoption of AI technologies, I believe Nvidia is well-positioned to sustain an EPS growth rate of 20% or higher over the next decade (reflected in my intrinsic valuation below).\nIn terms of Nvidia's free cash flow dynamics, the company experienced an extraordinary surge, increasing by 269.10% over the past year. Over the past decade, Nvidia has maintained an average annual FCF growth rate of 28.50%, underscoring its financial resilience and strong cash generation capabilities. These robust cash flow dynamics are crucial for sustaining future growth, funding research and development in addition to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, which is expected to add more value to holding the stock.\nLooking forward, it is crucial to consider the current market and its expected growth. Nvidia is the leading beneficiary of this expansion given its leading position and competitive advantages. Its Blackwell architecture could deliver up to 4 times faster training than H100, potentially expanding the GPU market to 2.5 times its current size. The Blackwell platform represents a further push toward a future where AI becomes a commodity, though Nvidia is not producing commoditized hardware. This integrated approach likely helps sustain Nvidia's valuation. With $47 billion in revenue from its data center segment in 2024, it is reasonable to assume that with market expansion, Nvidia could potentially generate revenue exceeding $100 billion annually in data center revenue in the near term.\nFigure 3: Nvidia dominating the AI race, recording significant data center growth versus peers\nSource: Nvidia investor relations\nIn terms of its peers, Nvidia is currently leading the market by a landslide. Its data center business has been growing much faster than those of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) over the past few quarters. Several factors contribute to its market leadership, primarily the CUDA toolkit, which enables engineers to fully leverage the GPU's computing power to accelerate applications.\nOnce applications are built on CUDA, it becomes challenging for customers to switch platforms. While Intel has just started producing and developing its Gaudi 3 GPU accelerator, which uses the same process node as Nvidia's H100, Nvidia has already begun production of its Blackwell products, the next generation of accelerators. This means competitors are at least one generation behind.\nRegarding exposure to China, I believe this no longer poses significant risks to Nvidia as its Chinese revenue is now in the mid-single digits, down from around 25% previously. This makes the current growth rates even more impressive. A return of China's revenue is now an option if and when U.S.-China relations improve. However, a commonly discussed risk is whether cutting China off from semiconductor supplies, whether from Nvidia or ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), increases the likelihood of Chinese competitors emerging. However, if AMD and Intel (being well established players) still lags Nvidia's performance and innovation, I do not see how Chinese competitors could be a threat in the near to medium term.\nFigure 4: Nvidia up 173% in the past year \nFrom a valuation perspective, Nvidia might not appeal to value investors as both the intrinsic and relative valuation measures suggest it is not attractive (on conservative/normalized growth estimates). Despite its stock being up over 170% in the past year, the company's consistent performance and significant revenue increases justify its current price levels. The company's performance is not just hype from the AI industry; it is backed by substantial revenue increases and improving margins. In the case of Nvidia, intangible investments are increasingly important in delivering shareholder value, making traditional valuation tools less relevant. The most crucial metric is how management rewards shareholders, best shown by the return on invested capital versus the weighted average cost of capital. According to this metric (as shown below), Nvidia's price gains are justified.\nFigure 5: Nvidia's ROIC-WACC \nFor those seeking a price target, I am confident Nvidia will maintain its leadership in the GPU market, driven by innovations such as H200 and Blackwell, along with its unique CUDA software platform. Therefore, I have established a one-year target price of $1,377 per share for Nvidia, reflecting its robust growth prospects and ongoing market-driving innovations. Some may argue this estimate is overly optimistic, but I firmly believe in its validity since we are still in the early stages of the AI revolution, and Nvidia is strategically positioned at the forefront to reap substantial benefits from this transformative wave.\nFigure 6: DCF valuation upon my aggressive estimates given AI growth potential\nSource: GuruFocus and author estimates\nNvidia's recent financial performance has been nothing short of extraordinary, with the company's innovative strides in AI and accelerated computing driving record-breaking revenue and earnings. While some investors might argue the stock is overvalued given its remarkable price surge over the past year, I firmly believe this is merely the beginning of its growth trajectory. Nvidia's stock price reflects not only its current operational performance, but also its future potential in a rapidly expanding market. As AI continues to evolve and integrate into various industries, Nvidia's role as a pivotal enabler of these technologies positions it to deliver sustained growth and value to shareholders.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Nvidia became the world's most valuable company on Tuesday, dethroning tech heavyweight Microsoft, as its chips continue to play a central role in a race to dominate the market for artificial intelligence.\nShares of the chipmaker climbed 3.2% to $135.21, lifting its market capitalization to $3.326 trillion, just days after overtaking iPhone maker Apple AAPL.O to become the second most valuable company. The stock has surged about 173% so far this year, compared with a rise of about 19% in Microsoft shares.\nCOMMENTS:\nSTEVE SOSNICK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, INTERACTIVE BROKERS, NEW YORK, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT\n\"It's Nvidia's market; we're all just trading in it.\"\n\"The roster of market leaders has changed before, so it's not that surprising to see it alter again.\"\nOLIVER PURSCHE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, WEALTHSPIRE ADVISORS, NEW YORK\n\u201c(Nvidia has) certainly been high flying and predictable I don\u2019t think it ultimately matters. Nvidia has been getting a lot of positive attention and has been doing a lot of things very correctly but a small misstep is likely cause a major correction in the stock, and investors should be careful.\u201d\n\u201cAI, and generative AI in particular, is pretty clearly going to have a massive impact on a large number of industries. The broader question is they've not had to face significant competition up until now, and it will be interesting to see how well the company does as competition and choices increase.\u201d\n\u201cUp until now, if you weren\u2019t buying an Nvidia chip, you weren't buying a chip designed to support AI, and that's changing rapidly.\u201d\nWASIF LATIF, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SARMAYA PARTNERS, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY\n\"There's been a lot of strong not only hedge fund buying but also broader retail buying in Nvidia. That's likely to continue given the tools that are out there in very specific thematic funds and leveraged funds. This run might continue until we do see a slowdown in the pace of its earnings growth. The stock move is pretty well correlated to the growth of its earnings and history shows us that the high growth stocks tend to do really well as long as that earnings growth trajectory is in intact. The math tells us that the growth is not possible on a perpetual basis. At some point, you'd see the growth rate slow down and at that point you might see the market reflecting some of the slowdown in the earnings growth. Otherwise, it's growing at a point and the market is factoring in that the stock would become the largest entity on the planet.\"\n"

        "Author": "  Manali Pradhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) have gained nearly 217% over the last year. Undoubtedly, the rapid advancement and adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications and large language models have been the key demand drivers for its AI-capable chips and systems. The graphics processing unit (GPU) leader has emerged as both an enabler and a major beneficiary of the ongoing generative AI revolution.\nNvidia posted a strong performance in its fiscal 2025 first quarter, which ended April 28: Revenue and earnings soared year over year by 262% and 690%, respectively. For the fiscal year, which will end Jan. 31, analysts expect its revenue to grow by 97% to $120 billion and earnings per share (EPS) to rise by 109% to $2.71.\nBeyond that exceptional short-term outlook, there are also at least three major reasons to expect Nvidia will grow significantly in the long run.\nNvidia's data center business revenue soared by a jaw-dropping 427% year over year to $22.6 billion in fiscal Q1. That segment accounted for 87% of its revenue, and will play a critical role in the company's future growth story.\nHyperscalers (large cloud infrastructure providers), enterprises across verticals, and sovereigns worldwide are upgrading trillions of dollars worth of installed data center infrastructure that was built around dumb NIC (network interface cards) and CPUs by installing accelerated computing hardware. This infrastructure has become critical in training and inferencing large language models and other generative AI applications. Nvidia also expects enterprises to upgrade existing accelerated computing infrastructure from that based on current Hopper architecture H100 chips to next-generation Hopper architecture H200 chips and next-generation Blackwell architecture chips.\nThe economics are highly appealing for clients, especially for cloud service providers. During the most recent earnings call, an Nvidia executive asserted that \"for every $1 spent on NVIDIA AI infrastructure, cloud providers have an opportunity to earn $5 in GPU instant hosting revenue over four years.\"\nDemand for Nvidia's AI GPUs is far outpacing supply, even though the company has been focusing on expanding production capacity for chips like H100 and Grace Hopper. It expects the supply of next-generation H200 and Blackwell chips will continue to fall short of demand until next year. This will ensure that Nvidia continues to enjoy pricing power, despite the increasing competition in this niche of the chip industry.\nBesides its AI GPUs, Nvidia has also introduced the Grace Hopper Superchip (CPU + GPU), Blackwell architecture chips, AI-optimized Spectrum-X Ethernet networking, and Nvidia AI enterprise software. These products help drive performance gains and users' lower costs while training and running AI applications.\nAccording to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, AI is enabling the $3 trillion information technology industry to build tools that can target nearly $100 trillion of industry. Against this backdrop of solid growth, commitment to innovation, and rapidly expanding market opportunities, the company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 33.93 looks justified, even if it is not cheap.\nNvidia has evolved from a chip supplier to a \"full stack\" AI platform provider. The company provides hardware such as GPUs, DPUs (data processing units), and CPUs a complete software stack (CUDA, AI enterprise software, inference microservices, Omniverse), high-speed networking components (InfiniBand, Ethernet), and servers to build \"AI factories\" that generate multimodal outputs (AI tokens) including text, images, audio, and video. AI factories refer to the essential infrastructure built by clients for AI production. In its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia worked with more than 100 customers to build AI factories that ranged in size from hundreds of GPUs to 100,000 GPUs.\nNvidia's GPUs and the supporting Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software stack -- an AI-optimized parallel programming platform for the company's hardware portfolio -- have been pivotal in multiple AI breakthroughs, including transformer models, unsupervised learning, and foundational models like GPT-4 and Meta Platforms' Llama. In its efforts to stay ahead of the competition, the company has accelerated the release cadence of its products and major features from once every two years to once every year. Nvidia has also built a large ecosystem of partners that includes technology titans, AI start-ups, and every major cloud service provider.\nAll these factors have enabled Nvidia to build a solid competitive moat in the burgeoning AI space.\nNvidia is also leveraging its AI platform to expand its addressable market in areas such as \"sovereign AI,\" the automotive industry, and physical AI.\nNvidia sees sovereign AI as a major growth opportunity since countries worldwide are building out their domestic AI capabilities. The company partners with governments and local players to provide end-to-end AI infrastructure. Management expects sovereign AI's contribution to Nvidia's revenue to grow from nothing in fiscal 2024 to a figure in the high-single-digit billions in fiscal 2025.\nNvidia's Drive platform, which integrates hardware and software solutions to provide computing power, AI technologies, and software frameworks for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems, is also seeing robust demand.\nNvidia also expects physical AI -- i.e., AI-enabled robots -- to be a major long-term growth driver. The company is creating end-to-end robotics platforms for factories and warehouses as well as humanoid robots.\nAlthough Nvidia's share price is near its all-time high, the growth drivers discussed above should provide a strong enough case to convince investors to pick up shares of this blockbuster stock now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "If you bought $1,000 of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock 10 years ago, you would have roughly $2.3 million today, a potentially life-changing return of 23,000%. While the company has probably become too large to deliver such rapid gains in the future, the next decade could bring many exciting opportunities as artificial intelligence (AI) technology develops. \nLet's discuss what this could mean for Nvidia and long-term investors. \nNvidia has been so successful because it sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) other tech companies need to build and train generative AI algorithms or make their data centers capable of handling these new workloads. This position means Nvidia benefits from the expansion of the industry as a whole, and the future looks bright.\nGenerative AI is a subset of machine learning designed to create new content based on user inputs and training data. Consulting group McKinsey & Company believes the technology will improve enough to perform at a level comparable to the median human by decade-end. If true, Nvidia could enjoy a virtually limitless addressable market as AI technology expands into new use cases by replacing skilled labor. \nInvestors should also remember that generative AI is one of several AI niches. Others include robotics and neural networks, which can be used for applications like self-driving cars. Over the next 10 years, these other markets could help Nvidia diversify its hardware business outside of just data center GPUs. In the first quarter, automotive and robotics represented just $329 million of Nvidia's $26 billion in sales.\nThe rise of generative AI has striking similarities with the internet in the 1990s and 2000s. While internet technology eventually transformed the global economy, the trajectory wasn't as smooth as some investors expected. During the dot-com bubble, Cisco Systems benefited from demand for networking hardware like routers and switches. And its market cap soared to over half a trillion dollars in March 2000.\nEventually, the bubble burst, and Cisco lost 88% of its value by 2002. Now, over two decades later, Cisco's market cap is just $187 billion, which means it has never recovered to its bubble-era price tag, even though the internet, as a whole, is clearly a financial success.\nNvidia faces some of the same potential challenges Cisco faced two decades ago. And even if generative AI reaches analysts' lofty projections, that will be no guarantee that Nvidia's equity will hold on to its $2.7 trillion market capitalization.\nThat being said, with a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 64 and a forward P/E of just 42, Nvidia is relatively affordable compared to its bottom-line growth rate (first-quarter profits surged 628% year over year to $14.88 billion). The market seems to already be pricing in some of the near-term risks, which could limit Nvidia's potential downside. \nFrom a fundamental perspective, Nvidia stock is still a great deal. Revenue and earnings are skyrocketing with a reasonable valuation. And over the next 10 years, the company's GPUs could find more use cases in automotive automation and robotics, unlocking additional growth and much-needed diversification to its revenue streams. \nThat being said, there is a negative gut feeling that comes from buying a stock that has already risen so far so fast, especially when you remember the lessons of other tech giants like Cisco Systems. While Nvidia clearly has spectacular long-term potential, investors should tread with caution and make sure to diversify their portfolios.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Shortly after it was founded in 1993, the company invented one of the first GPUs, or graphics processing units, originally for use in video games and graphic design.\nSince then, the company has upped its ambitions and grown into its name, which is a play on the latin word for envy, by humbling tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Google with its $3.34 trillion market cap\u2014which has more than doubled since January.

The key to its success, analysts told Fortune, started decades ago with its early preparation for the AI frenzy now sweeping markets.\nCPUs, the most common computer chips which date back to the 1950s, are great for executing complex calculations one at a time, but they didn\u2019t quite fit the needs of data scientists when deep learning and AI research intensified in the 2010s. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, by contrast, were a perfect fit for AI because they could perform many simple calculations at once. In 2012, Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI\u2019s former chief scientist and the cofounder of AI startup Safe Superintelligence, was already using Nvidia chips for an early convolutional neural network called AlexNet.\nNvidia\u2019s chips have progressed rapidly in recent years, and its GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip released last August can now perform 200 quintillion (200 followed by 18 zeros) calculations per second.\nBut Nvidia was only able to corner the market on AI thanks to timely bets made by CEO Jensen Huang years earlier, Baird semiconductors senior research analyst Tristan Gerra told Fortune. One of its prescient moves included creating CUDA, a high-level programming tool the company built in 2007 to help unlock the full capability of its GPUs in a straightforward way.\n\u201cJensen, Nvidia\u2019s co-founder and CEO, is a visionary and saw the trends of GPU adoption in data centers early on and aligned the company\u2019s strategy to that vision,\u201d Gerra said.\nCUDA is now so widely used that it\u2019s difficult for companies building large language models like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT to imagine themselves using other tech, added John Abbott, an infrastructure analyst with 451 Research, which is part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\u201cLarge models can take months to train, and massive clusters are required to shorten that time. Because mature software tools\u2014and the skills needed to use them\u2014are readily available for Nvidia GPUs, there has really been no other choice. Nvidia GPUs have become a de-facto standard,\u201d Abbot said in an email.\nApart from its early-mover advantage, Gerra said the company has a technological leg up as well.\n\u201cNvidia provides a full supercomputer solution, including the highest-performance hardware (chips) and software suite. The competition offers AI chips only,\u201d said Gerra.\nStill, Nvidia faces several threats to its dominant position in AI chips, warned Abbot. Although Nvidia controls about 90% of the AI chips market, some big tech competitors such as Meta and Google have started producing in-house chips to compete.\nThe company also faces geopolitical obstacles in China. The U.S. is restricting Nvidia's ability to expand in the country, and China\u2019s government is trying hard to create an alternative to the company\u2019s products. The threat of war could also upend the company\u2019s business.\n\u201cTaiwan\u2014from where NVIDIA sources all of its GPUs at the moment\u2014is under political threat.\u00a0 Ongoing supply chain issues are also a big risk,\u201d said Abbot.\nYet, for now, Nvidia is still riding high. Shares of the company have skyrocketed so much that the company instituted a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this month. Its gains have accounted for a third of the total value added to the S&P 500 since January.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n.\n"

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Whether you're a casual investor or trade professionally, you're likely aware of the boom in the artificial intelligence (AI) market that has captivated Wall Street over the last year. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT toward the end of 2022 reinvigorated the industry and led countless companies to pivot their businesses toward AI.\nExcitement over the generative technology has led to companies across tech enjoying significant stock growth. Notable are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which have seen their share prices soar 222% and 45%, respectively, since last June. These companies have achieved powerful positions in AI, with one leading the chip market and the other excelling in software.\nDespite recent growth, these companies likely still have much more to offer new investors, with the AI market projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030.\nSo, let's take a closer look at these tech giants and determine whether Nvidia or Amazon is the better stock to invest in AI this June.\nAfter soaring growth over the last year, Nvidia introduced a 10-for-1 stock split on June 10. The split has lowered its price per share, making now an attractive time to buy -- and multiple analysts seem to agree.\nArgus Research and Oppenheimer recently increased their price targets from $110 per share to $150, maintaining a buy rating. Meanwhile, Evercore ISI raised its target to $145 from $131, expressing a similar sentiment.\nDespite delivering record gains, Nvidia's powerful position in AI and tech in general indicates it's still nowhere near hitting its ceiling. The company maintains an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the chips necessary to train AI models. Meanwhile, chip demand is expected to rise for the foreseeable future as the AI market develops.\nMoreover, Nvidia is keeping up with the demand for powerful hardware and retaining its lead among competitors by making a change to its product release schedule. The company will now design new chips yearly rather than every two years, like was once customary.\nThe move has forced rivals like AMD to do the same. However, with $39 billion in free cash flow compared to AMD's just over $1 billion, Nvidia is better equipped to retain its lead in AI and keep investing in its business.\nLike Nvidia, Amazon is leading its respective area of AI. The company is home to the world's largest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, which outperforms competitors Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud in market share.\nAs a result, Amazon has been able to leverage its extensive list of clientele to tout its AI products and get ahead in the industry. The company's success was evident in recent quarterly earnings. In the first quarter of 2024, AWS posted revenue growth of 17% year over year, with operating income soaring 84%. The segment has quickly become the most lucrative part of Amazon's business, responsible for 60% of its operating income.\nConsequently, Amazon is investing billions into expanding AWS' reach and building data centers in multiple countries, including Taiwan and India. Meanwhile, AWS has ventured into chip design, announcing its Trainium2 chips last year, built specifically for training AI models.\nAmazon's free cash flow has soared more than 1,000% since last June, while its operating income has increased by 99%. The figures highlight the reliability of Amazon's business and prove it has the financial resources to go far in AI.\nNvidia and Amazon have delivered stellar gains thanks to AI, but they are likely not done yet. These companies continue to have massive growth potential in the industry and would likely prove to be assets to any portfolio over the long term. As a result, it could be a good idea to consider their valuations when determining which is the better buy.\nThis chart shows Amazon's stock is trading at a bargain compared to Nvidia's, with a lower price-to-sales and forward price-to-earnings ratio. In addition to a promising position in AI, Amazon is a no-brainer over Nvidia right now. However, it's still worth keeping an eye on Nvidia and investing when the time is right.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Competition for the title of most valuable company in the world is heating up. Earlier this week Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), after its monster run over the last few years, leapfrogged Microsoft and Apple to become the largest company in the world by market capitalization (market cap), the total value of all publicly traded shares of a company.\nAfter topping its rivals, Nvidia slid back to third place, but this isn't any reason to fret. It's a tight race and the three are likely to be trading places for some time. The next round of earnings later this summer will be a major catalyst that could move the needle to a more stable place if any of the companies beat their own guidance and Wall Street's expectations -- or fall short.\nNo investing theme is more popular right now than artificial intelligence (AI) and Nvidia is its poster child. Investors are salivating at the incredible returns the company is delivering consistently quarter after quarter -- its revenue last quarter was up 260% year over year -- with the promise of continued growth into the future. Its rapid ascent since AI captured the public's attention is one for the record books. But what should investors pay attention to long-term?\nNvidia holds a unique position in the market. The company was so ahead of the curve that it was able to capture roughly 80% of the AI chipmaking business.\nOf course, like most wildly successful companies, it was a matter of a little bit of luck and a lot of foresight. CEO Jensen Huang made a bet. Nvidia made chips called graphics processing units (GPUs) that were, for a large chunk of the company's history, accessories to the all-powerful central processing unit (CPU) that made Intel what it was. He saw that the industry was reaching the limits of scaling CPU technology and that his company's GPUs could step into the spotlight.\nTurns out he was right. Without getting into too much technical detail, if you shift the focus to chips that are very like GPUs -- such as the company's Grace Blackwell \"Superchip\" -- with CPUs running a supporting role, you can run power-hungry applications and continue to scale them up. And AI is undoubtedly power-hungry.\nNvidia doubled down on this tech before it was fashionable, so when AI exploded onto the scene, the company was already there, supplying the entire industry with its tech. Now AI servers run by the likes of Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are powered by Nvidia chips.\nNvidia went from a relatively niche computing company, mostly servicing the video game industry, to one of the largest companies in the world. Just look at this reversal of fortunes from the once-dominant CPU maker, Intel. The chart shows revenue for both companies over the last 10 years on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis.\nThat is a twist of fate. But fate can be fickle. Nvidia's future largely depends on AI delivering on its promise. Much has been made of its revolutionary power, but there is still a lot to prove. It wouldn't be the first time a technology failed to deliver on the hype surrounding it. Still, I think there's more reason to believe AI isn't a fluke than some past hype cycles, so then it's a matter of when it can deliver.\nIf the AI value chain is a river, Nvidia is somewhere in the middle, upstream from the companies that actually deliver AI products to the end market. If those companies have overpromised on their products' value or can't deliver in time, the river gets dammed up downstream, potentially leading to a glut of unwanted chips. For Nvidia to continue the incredible growth it has been experiencing, enough to justify the premium value investors have placed on it, end-user demand has to keep the river flowing freely.\nKeep an eye on how well the end-user AI applications are doing. Try some out. Do you see the value? The more useful these tools are, the higher the river's watermark and the more likely Nvidia is to deliver on its sky-high expectations.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia shares rebounded Tuesday, halting a three-day skid that had surprised many investors and wiped away more than $400 billion in market value.\nEarly last week, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as Wall Street\u2019s most valuable public company. Then it fell 13% over three days, its worst such stretch since 2022. Because Nvidia has become so massive in size, the movements for its stock carry extra weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.\nAny stock that climbs as much as Nvidia has \u2014 up more than 1,000% since the autumn of 2022 \u2014 is vulnerable to some of its investors selling shares in order to lock in some profits. That earlier run makes a 13% drop over three days look like a relative trifle.\nMonday, Nvidia shares rose 6.8%, bringing its market value to $3.10 trillion, behind Microsoft at $3.35 trillion and Apple at $3.21 trillion.\nThose three companies and a few others are responsible for much of the S&P 500\u2019s returns recently. Investors would prefer a market where many stocks are participating in the gains.\nThere\u2019s been nearly insatiable demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips to power artificial intelligence applications and the company has played a big role in the U.S. stock market\u2019s recent record runs even as the economy\u2019s growth slows under the weight of high interest rates. But the AI boom is moving at such a rapid pace that it\u2019s raised worries about a possible bubble in the stock market and too-high expectations among investors.\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a statement that while Nvidia's stock has declined in recent days, one must also look at the bigger picture.\n\u201cThe shares have still gained 190% on a 12-month view, so it\u2019s no surprise some investors are locking in some profits,\u201d he said.\nNathan also isn't concerned about potential wider spread implications. \"Although Nvidia has sneezed, the wider market hasn\u2019t caught a cold with a mixture of less extreme movements in both directions for the rest of the Magnificent 7,\u201d he said.\nThe Magnificent 7, which include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, are a small group of stocks that are responsible for a big chunk of the U.S. stock market's total return.\nSome critics say Nvidia still looks expensive. Its stock is trading at a price that\u2019s 73 times higher than the profit that it\u2019s produced over the last 12 months. That makes it look much more expensive than the broad S&P 500 index, where companies are trading at just 26 times their overall earnings. That itself looks pricey to skeptics, who say the broad U.S. stock market looks expensive compared with history.\nThe thing Nvidia has going for it is the possibility of continued, incredible growth as it ushers in a new era that proponents say will remake the economy.\nBased on its expected profit over the next 12 months, Nvidia is trading at a still expensive but more reasonable price-earnings ratio of roughly 40. And if generative AI hardware deployments are still only in year two of what could be a three-to-five year deployment cycle, as analysts at Bank of America suggest, the possible runway of growth could make it look even more compelling.\nAnalysts estimate that the company\u2019s revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025 will reach $119.9 billion \u2014 about double its revenue for fiscal 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.\n__\nAssociated Press Business Writer Stan Choe in New York contributed to this report.\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is playing a crucial role in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) today thanks to its top-performing graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips power some of the most important AI tasks like the training and inferencing of large language models (LLMs) so that these LLMs then can go on to solve complex problems.\nAnd Nvidia has gone beyond this by developing entire AI systems, as well as services, so that the company can be a customer's one-stop shop for AI. Even better, the potential customer can easily access these offerings since they're available through all public-cloud providers. All of this has helped Nvidia's sales soar over the past few years, climbing in the triple digits to record levels quarter after quarter. In the most recent report, sales reached a record $26 billion. More than 85% of that was from Nvidia's data-center business. (Data center includes the company's AI products and services.)\nAll of this sounds great, but investors have worried about one thing: potential rivals. Competition is heating up as companies from Intel to Advanced Micro Devices launch new AI products and even suggest these products might outperform Nvidia's GPUs. Should you worry? Not necessarily. Instead, meet the one thing that could keep Nvidia ahead of the competition.\nFirst, a quick look at where Nvidia stands right now. The company's top-performing GPU is the H100, a product in such high demand that delivery-wait times last year stretched out to as many as 11 months. Today, that delivery window is a lot shorter, but demand for this and other Nvidia products continues to soar.\nIn the most recent earnings report, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said demand has surpassed supply, leaving Nvidia \"racing\" at every moment to keep up. Meanwhile, Nvidia aims to begin shipping the H200, a new GPU that almost doubles the inference power of the H100, during this current quarter. And Nvidia plans to launch its new Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever later this year. The company says demand for the H200 and for Blackwell surpasses supply, and this trend may continue into next year too.\nAnd this leads me to the one thing that could keep Nvidia ahead of rivals. This is Nvidia's \"one-year rhythm\" as Huang calls it, referring to the company's pledge to launch better-performing chips on an annual basis.\nThis means that when a rival releases a chip that beats Nvidia's current one, a new and better Nvidia product likely will be right around the corner. For example, Intel recently said its latest release, the Gaudi 3 accelerator, tops the H100 in inference and power efficiency. But Nvidia already is on track to deliver higher-performing chips in the coming weeks and months.\nIf Nvidia can keep up this rapid pace of innovation, and so far it's given us reason to be confident, the company should be able to maintain its market position and stay ahead of rivals over the long term. This doesn't mean companies like Intel or AMD won't be successful over time too. Considering the forecast for an AI market worth more than $1 trillion by 2030 and the demand for chips today, there's room for many players to generate billion-dollar revenue in this space.\nAs for Nvidia, though, this company should continue to attract customers seeking the fastest chips around. And considering the demand Nvidia has seen so far, there are plenty of them.\nSo, yes, rivals are bringing interesting products to market, and they could carve out market share but probably not enough to unseat Nvidia. And that means investors shouldn't worry about the possibility of Nvidia's earnings declining as other chip designers launch new products. I don't see this as a big risk for Nvidia today or in the foreseeable future as long as this top player sticks to its innovation promises.\nThat means that Nvidia, trading at 42 times times forward-earnings estimates, looks like a reasonable buy today. The AI boom has just started, and Nvidia has what it takes to maintain its lead throughout the chapters of this high-growth story.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of the 8 Best AI PC Stocks to Buy Now. Since NVIDIA Corporation (NYSE:NVDA) ranks 2nd in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nWhen the AI revolution began with the launch of ChatGPT, no one would have thought that down the road it would bring a huge growth catalyst for the PC industry, notorious for its cyclical nature and unpredictability. Fast forward to today, everyone is talking about PCs equipped with AI-focused equipment capable to process generative AI workloads. But in just a matter of few months why did the market feel the need for AI PCs? It all boils down to costs. GPT-4 costs $0.03 per 1,000 tokens for prompts and $0.06 for completion according to Microsoft\u2019s estimates. Consider millions of users prompting LLMs from their phones and computers. The costs of scaling such systems are not feasible. That\u2019s why the market thought allowing users to process AI-intensive workloads natively instead of using the Cloud is the future. And that caused the AI PC boom. Tech market analyst firm Canalys says AI PC shipments are expected to soar to 170 million in 2027, from 25 million in 2022. That would be a 60% share of the total PC market. The firm also expects AI PC shipments to double from 2023 to 2024 and double gain from 2024 to 2025.\nCanalys also expects vendors to ship 205 million AI-capable PCs in 2028, representing a CAGR of 44% from 2024 through 2028.\nFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 919 hedge funds and picked 8 AI PC stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\nNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:NVDA)\u00a0is a no-brainer name when it comes to the best AI PC stocks, thanks to NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:NVDA)\u00a0wide range of chips it\u2019s providing to power AI workstations and laptops.

NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:NVDA)\u00a0recently teased RTX AI laptops at Computex 2024.\nWhile NVIDIA Corporation (NYSE:NVDA) is one of the best AI PC stocks based on hedge fund sentiment, many circles have voiced concerns over NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:NVDA) valuation and whether the stock would be able to continue on its growth trajectory. NVIDIA Corporation (NYSE:NVDA) expects $28.0 billion in revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which was a sharp decline in growth rate according to many.

        "Title": "After Nvidia's Stock Split, Can It Reach $1,200 Again?",
        "Author": "  Johnny Rice, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The market can't get enough of artificial intelligence (AI) darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The semiconductor giant sits just shy of a $3 trillion valuation, making it the third-largest company in the world.\nNvidia is the premier provider of AI chips. Its hardware powers the technology so many believe is the next big thing. Since ChatGPT-3 was first released to the public, Nvidia's stock is up almost 700%, and it tipped above $1,200 a share last week.\nShares are now trading at around $130. What happened? No, the company's stock did not crater and lose 90% of its value. Instead, the massive rise in price led the company to initiate a 10-1 stock split. Shareholders now own 10 times as many shares as they did before the split, with each share worth a tenth of the price.\nA split like this is more or less cosmetic; in and of itself, it doesn't change the values of people's investments. However, it's not without consequence. The stock is now more accessible to smaller investors; $130 is much easier to stomach than $1,200, a number that might have kept investors from grabbing a few shares.\nReaching $1,200 again would mean a 10x from today's price. Nvidia already pulled off a 10x in the last three years, but doing so again would mean reaching a $30 trillion market cap -- a mind-boggling figure. It's a different ball game when you are already the third-largest company in the world, but it's not without precedent.\nIn 2010, Apple was the second-largest company in the world. The company made headlines that year as it neared a $300 billion market cap. Fast-forward to 2022, and Apple was again in the headlines, this time as the largest company in the world and the first to pass the $3 trillion mark. I bet $3 trillion seemed mind-boggling to a lot of investors in 2010, but here we are.\nLet's start by assuming Nvidia's growth will slow from the past three years. What's a more reasonable rate? The market as a whole is a good place to start. Statista.com predicts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 28.5% through 2030 for the entire AI market. If that growth rate holds, it would take roughly nine years for Nvidia's stock to reach $1,200 again.\nBut before you get too excited, there are a few pretty huge assumptions there. We're assuming that projected CAGR holds beyond 2030 and that it isn't overinflated to begin with. Secondly, we're assuming that the market will value Nvidia relative to its earnings the same over time. This isn't necessarily true. Just because a company grows its earnings doesn't mean its stock price will respond in kind, but it's a useful simplification for now.\nSo if we make those assumptions, can Nvidia grow at the same rate as the overall market? I'm not sure it's likely for a few reasons, competition being chief among them.\nNvidia currently has a near stranglehold on the AI chip market -- about 80%. This gives Nvidia a lot of pricing power, allowing it to enjoy incredible profit margins. But I think this will change.\nLong-time competitors Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are doing everything they can to catch up. To date, they haven't been able to produce something on par with Nvidia in the eyes of the market. But make no mistake, they are trying. AMD CEO Lisa Su said at a recent unveiling of the company's latest chips, \"AI is our No. 1 priority.\" Nvidia isn't the only company capable of producing hardware that can service the industry.\nAnd it's not just rival chipmakers. Perhaps more concerning is that Nvidia's main rivals -- think Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon -- are pouring money into their own chipmaking programs, hoping to detach themselves from outside suppliers altogether. Nvidia will have to stay ahead of the most innovative companies in the world -- and do it at a price that remains competitive.\nCan Nvidia reach $1,200 again? Absolutely. Will it? I think it's likely. When? Don't expect a repeat of the last three years. A more reasonable timeline would be at least a decade. That would still be amazing growth that far outpaces what the vast majority of solid investments return. Getting too hung up on giant multiples or specific price targets can ultimately distract from making sound decisions in the market.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Last week, Apple also overtook Microsoft to trade in the top spot briefly.\nThe ranking is yet another reminder that AI is the top focus of many investors. Nvidia is seen as the biggest and earliest beneficiary of the technology as it dominates the market with its highly sought-after chips that help power data centers running complex computing tasks required by AI applications. Demand for its H100 accelerators are surging and helped drive the chipmaker\u2019s sales up by more than 125% last year.\nMicrosoft, for its part, is also seen as an early AI winner given its investment and partnership with OpenAI, which created ChatGPT.

        "Text": "In just the past year, AI chip leader Nvidia has soared more than 200% into the upper echelon of the world's most valuable companies and is already closing in on Microsoft and Apple.\nBut Beth Kindig, lead tech analyst at the I/O Fund, sees more astronomical gains in the coming years, predicting Nvidia's market cap will surge another 270% to $10 trillion. As of Friday's close, the company was worth about $2.7 trillion.\nIn an interview Tuesday on CNBC, she pointed out Nvidia is fueling the AI infrastructure as its chips are in high demand for data centers that train large language models and later this year will release its Blackwell chips, which are expected to outperform the earlier Hopper chips.\nIn addition to hardware, Nvidia's software also gives it an advantage, while the automotive sector will deliver a further boost to the company, Kindig noted.\n\"So we have a lot coming,\" she said. \"This is very, very early for Nvidia, and there's a few layers.\"\nWhile rivals like AMD and Intel have made their own bullish forecasts on the AI market, Kindig said Nvidia will grab the \"lion's share,\" adding that other tech giants developing chips in-house typically do it to optimize their own applications and won't commercialize the chips the way Nvidia does.\nOn the software side, she pointed to Nvidia's CUDA platform, comparing it to Apple's iOS operating system, which helped make the iPhone dominant.\n\"The same thing is happening with Nvidia, which is that the CUDA platform is what software engineers, AI engineers are learning in order to program GPUs,\" Kindig said. \"So that helps lock them in.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- The US is opening antitrust investigations into two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp., over their dominance of the rapidly emerging field of artificial intelligence, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHunter Biden Convicted of Gun Charges by Jury in Delaware\nApple Hits Record After Introducing \u2018AI for the Rest of Us\u2019\nMusk to Ban Apple Devices If OpenAI Is Integrated Into OS\nFed\u2019s Higher-for-Longer Stance Hits Firms That Expected Rate Cut\nStocks Rise as Solid Treasury Sale Spurs CPI Bets: Markets Wrap\nMicrosoft has poured more than $13 billion into its partnership with OpenAI, tapping the startup\u2019s generative-AI technology for the Bing search service, Edge internet browser and Windows. Nvidia, the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker, has acknowledged allocating its chips to customers it deems most likely to use them quickly, prompting concerns that it has too much power over the market for cutting-edge AI semiconductors.\nThe country\u2019s two antitrust agencies also agreed to divide responsibility over AI. The Federal Trade Commission will handle the inquiry into Microsoft\u2019s ties with OpenAI, while the Justice Department will probe Nvidia\u2019s dominance in AI chips, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing inter-agency negotiations. The DOJ will retain oversight of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, the people said.\nThe agencies reached the deal in the last few days after more than six months of negotiations, the people said. The agreement gives each agency authority to open an antitrust probe into the conduct of the respective companies and their recent deals.\nThe FTC has also opened a probe into whether Microsoft failed to properly notify the antitrust agencies about its deal with Inflection AI, according to the people. In March, the Redmond, Washington-based software giant agreed to pay the startup $650 million to license its AI software and hired much of Inflection\u2019s staff. The agency can levy fines if it determines Microsoft violated the law about reporting transactions.\nA Microsoft spokeswoman said the company has not been contacted by the FTC regarding OpenAI.\n\u201cOur agreements with Inflection gave us the opportunity to recruit individuals at Inflection AI and build a team capable of accelerating Microsoft Copilot, while enabling Inflection to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe take our legal obligations to report transactions seriously and are confident that we have complied with those obligations.\u201d\nThe DOJ, FTC, OpenAI, Google and Nvidia all declined to comment. The New York Times reported the FTC-DOJ agreement earlier.\nThe Justice Department and FTC jointly enforce US antitrust laws and work together to coordinate which agency will investigate mergers and anticompetitive conduct through a process internally known as clearance. High-profile matters, such as those involving Google, have previously caused bitter clearance disputes between the agencies.\nThe deal was negotiated directly between Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter and FTC Chair Lina Khan, the people said. The two met in person this week on the sidelines of a conference in Washington.\nThe Justice Department had initially proposed splitting up the cases by company, according to the people, taking for itself all antitrust issues related to Microsoft and giving the FTC anything related to Nvidia, the people said. The FTC has previous history with Nvidia, having overseen recent mergers and suing to stop the company from buying Arm Ltd. in December 2021. Nvidia then walked away from that deal.\nThe DOJ\u2019s proposal tracks with past practice. With the exception of Microsoft\u2019s recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Justice has overseen the company since 1993 and has deep familiarity with the search and browser markets owing to its recent cases against Google.\nThe FTC disagreed with that division of authority, arguing that it has the more relevant experience to take on Microsoft and that its consumer protection mandate means it\u2019s in a better position to challenge potentially problematic conduct by AI startups.\nThe commission has been in the beginning stages of a probe into the cloud computing market, seeking public comments last year. As part of that inquiry, online rivals and others complained about both Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft, the No. 1 and No. 2 cloud companies respectively, which control more than 55% of the market.\nThe agency also sought information from OpenAI last year as part of a probe into whether the company engaged in unfair or deceptive practices that caused \u201creputational harm\u201d to consumers.\nIn January, the FTC opened an inquiry into Microsoft\u2019s OpenAI investment as well as deals by Google and Amazon to invest in rival AI-startup Anthropic. The five-member agency didn\u2019t inform the Justice Department before announcing that study, according to the people, which heightened tensions between the two agencies.\nLast week, the Justice Department held a public workshop on competition in AI at Stanford University, featuring dozens of companies across the industry. While Nvidia was rarely mentioned by name, companies have said the scarcity of high-powered chips needed to train AI foundation models was significantly impacting the industry.\nNvidia\u2019s leaders have openly acknowledged they allocate the supply of chips and other products to customers. They decide who gets what on the basis of whether or not the would-be recipient is able to immediately put those products to work in a data center that\u2019s ready to go. This is a mechanism to ensure that data center operators don\u2019t hoard chips, Nvidia has said.\nThe chip industry has long endured periods when there isn\u2019t enough supply to meet demand, only to ramp up production and wind up with more chips than buyers. Recently Tesla Inc. founder Elon Musk said he\u2019d diverted some of the Nvidia chips he\u2019d ordered from Tesla to other companies he controls because the electric carmaker doesn\u2019t have the space to immediately put them to work.\nOverall Nvidia has said that it\u2019s struggled to get enough supply from its manufacturing partners to meet the rapid surge in demand that it\u2019s received. While that supply is improving, it\u2019s likely to continue to fall short.\nThe European Union also looked at Microsoft\u2019s investment in OpenAI but ultimately decided against a formal probe. The UK\u2019s competition watchdog has also said it would examine the partnership but separately decided last month that a Microsoft deal with French AI company Mistral AI doesn\u2019t qualify for an investigation.\n--With assistance from Jackie Davalos and Davey Alba.\n(Updates with additional details beginning in sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAs Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks\nFood Companies Hope You Won\u2019t Notice Shortages Are Raising Prices\nLegacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers\nChina\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\nTesla Shareholders Face the $56 Billion Question\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "There might be no company that represents the artificial intelligence (AI) boom quite like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The thriving chipmaker is firing on all cylinders right now. And it has rewarded its shareholders in remarkable fashion.\nI'm sure you're looking at ways to gain exposure to the ongoing AI trend. However, perhaps it's best to forget about Nvidia. Instead, consider buying this other \"Magnificent Seven\" stock instead.\nNvidia impressed investors once again with a fantastic financial report. During the three-month period that ended April 28 (Q1 2025), the business revealed that revenue skyrocketed 262% year over year to $26 billion. Operating income was even more impressive, up 690%.\nDemand for Nvidia's chips is as robust as ever, particularly in the data center segment. Looking ahead, executives believe sales will be $28 billion in the current fiscal quarter. While that would mark a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year slowdown, it still would mean huge growth for the business.\nUnsurprisingly, the hype for Nvidia continues to soar as well, as the market remains enamored with AI-focused businesses. Shares trade at a nosebleed price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 35.9, indicating just how lofty investors' expectations are. Nvidia looks to be priced for perfection right now.\nInvestors who want to buy Nvidia shares today are probably not too happy that they missed the stock's monumental rise. This might be a bold statement, but at this point, I think it's a perfect example of people trying to chase returns, which isn't a smart investment strategy.\nIt's hard to tell investors to ignore one of the hottest stocks in the market. But there's a business that is posting strong results that is already a leader in AI. I'm talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The $2.2 trillion company has been a big winner for shareholders, and it's poised to continue this trend.\nDespite generating a sizable $307 billion in sales last year, Wall Street consensus analyst estimates call for revenue to increase at a compound annual rate of 11.5% between 2023 and 2026. That growth is going to come from greater usage of Alphabet's numerous products and services, which will help drive more digital ad revenue. Here's where AI will help.\nSundar Pichai, Alphabet's CEO, proclaimed back in 2016 that the world was going to transition from mobile to an AI-first focus. This kind of thinking early on has put the business at the forefront of this emerging technology.\nAlphabet has such a massive user base, with six products being used by at least 2 billion people, that it's effortless to ship new AI features with almost instant mass adoption. Some of the most well-known services, like Photos, Maps, Gmail, and YouTube, have long utilized AI in some form.\nAnd when it comes to Google Cloud, there is more of an opportunity to have a bigger impact. As the industry's third-largest player with first-quarter revenue of $9.6 billion, this segment is becoming a mission-critical tech infrastructure partner for its client base. Customers can use a wide range of tools, like generative AI, machine learning, and speech and text features, to build their own applications.\nIt's understandable that investors gravitate toward the hot new business or stock in order to ride the momentum to quick profits. But with AI, this dominant internet firm looks to be in a favorable position to benefit. Alphabet has almost unlimited financial resources, as exemplified by $108 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, to invest aggressively in servers and network infrastructure to strengthen its position in the AI race.\nShares trade at a P/S ratio of 7.2, which is significantly more reasonable than Nvidia's valuation. Consequently, I believe Alphabet is the one AI stock investors should look to buy instead of the high-flying GPU stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) delivered an outstanding set of results once again for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (for the three months ended April 28) on May 22. Not surprisingly, the company's data center segment was the star of the show.\nThe huge demand for Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) chips led to a stunning 427% year-over-year jump in its data center revenue last quarter to $22.6 billion, accounting for 87% of its top line. This segment was the driving force behind the eye-popping surge in Nvidia stock in the past year and a half, and it could continue to be a big money spinner for the company thanks to the fast-growing addressable opportunity within AI chips.\nHowever, there is another segment where Nvidia is seeing benefits related to AI adoption. Let's take a closer look at that business and why it could become a big deal for the company in the long run.\nNvidia's gaming revenue increased 18% year over year in the previous quarter to $2.6 billion, accounting for 10% of the company's top line. The size of Nvidia's gaming business pales in comparison to the revenue it gets from selling data center chips, but there is a good chance that it could become a bigger contributor in the future, thanks to the emergence of AI-enabled personal computers (PCs).\nNvidia management remarked on the latest earnings conference call that its RTX class of PC graphics processing units (GPUs) are equipped with CUDA Tensor Cores, which is why they can run generative AI applications. Nvidia points out that its RTX GPUs have an installed base of more than 100 million, and the company's software framework allows these users to run large language models (LLMs).\nFor instance, Nvidia partnered with Microsoft to enable AI-specific performance optimizations on Windows so that RTX-powered PCs can run LLMs up to three times faster than before. These moves Nvidia made to target the AI PC market could pay off handsomely in the long run. That's because the demand for AI-enabled PCs is set to take off remarkably.\nAccording to IDC, AI PC shipments could hit 50 million units in 2024 and more than triple to 167 million units in 2027. It won't be surprising to see this market growing at a nice clip even after that, as AI PCs are expected to account for 60% of all PC shipments in 2027. The growing shipments of AI PCs should ideally create the need for more Nvidia GPUs so that users can run AI models and applications locally on their computers.\nIt is worth noting that 53% of Nvidia's installed base use the company's RTX-class GPUs. We have seen that the company puts its RTX installed base at around 100 million, which means that there are almost an equivalent number of users who use older graphics cards. The adoption of AI PCs is likely to encourage those users to upgrade to newer graphics cards, and this should unlock a solid growth opportunity for Nvidia's gaming business, as it controls 80% of the PC graphics card market.\nOn the other hand, Nvidia also dominates the data center GPU market with an estimated share of more than 90%. What this means is that Nvidia is the dominant player in the overall market for discrete GPUs. This puts the company in a terrific position to grow at an outstanding pace in the long run, as the overall GPU market is set to grow to $773 billion in 2032 from $42 billion in 2022, according to Precedence Research.\nNvidia's solid quarterly report, its impressive share of the GPU market in both servers and PCs, and the multi-billion-dollar revenue opportunity that this market presents explain why analysts have raised their growth expectations from the company.\nThe chipmaker is now expected to finish fiscal 2025 with more than $120 billion in revenue, which will be almost double the revenue it generated in fiscal 2024. Nvidia's revenue is forecasted to head higher over the next couple of fiscal years as well, though it won't be surprising to see the company deliver stronger growth than analysts expect, thanks to the gaming and data center GPU opportunity.\nThat's why investors looking to buy a growth stock can still consider buying Nvidia, as its red-hot rally seems sustainable.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Lewis Krauskopf ",
        "Text": "By Lewis Krauskopf\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Nvidia has become the world\u2019s most valuable company following a staggering rally in its shares, underlining the outsized role investors expect artificial intelligence to play in the global economy over coming years.\nNvidia shares rose 3.5% on Tuesday, giving it a market value of about $3.34 trillion. That pushed the semiconductor bellwether past Microsoft and Apple, which had been jostling for the top spots in recent days.\nThe surge in Nvidia's market value has been driven by demand for its chips, which are the gold standard in the AI space. The company's shares are up more than 170% this year and have risen about 1,100% since their October 2022 low.\nBlockbuster earnings and broadening investor enthusiasm over AI are supercharging Nvidia's rally. That fervor has been reflected in Nvidia\u2019s market value, which took only 96 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion.\nMicrosoft, one of the two other companies to reach those rarefied levels, took 945 days to go from $2 trillion to $3 trillion while Apple took 1,044 days to make the leap, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\nPreviously, just 11 U.S. companies since 1925 have reached the top spot in market value on a closing basis, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nFortunes have diverged for past holders of the top position in recent decades. Microsoft reached No. 1 in the late 1990s but then its shares struggled for years during the early 2000s following the dotcom bubble, only to come roaring back in the latter half of the last decade.\nExxon Mobil became the world\u2019s most valuable company in the 2000s but its shares retreated following a downturn in oil prices.\nTo some, Cisco is the cautionary tale. The company\u2019s shares peaked at over $80 in March 2000 in the midst of the dotcom boom, during which investors often assigned dizzying valuations to internet-related companies.\nBespoke\u2019s analysts recently contrasted the trajectories of Nvidia and Cisco, whose products were seen as essential in supporting the internet's infrastructure.\n\"NVDA's run has been incredible, but it will need to keep growing from here and stave off competition if its stock is going to keep putting up stellar returns,\" Bespoke said in a recent note.\nFor now, Nvidia\u2019s earnings are supporting its stock price. Revenue more than tripled to $26 billion in the latest quarter, while net income jumped seven-fold to $14.9 billion.\nRevenue for the current fiscal year is expected to roughly double to $120 billion, and then rise another 33% in fiscal 2026, to $160 billion, according to LSEG data.\nNvidia's impressive financial performance and forecasts have led its stock valuation, by some measures, to moderate despite the surge in its share price. For example, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio last stood at 43, according to LSEG Datastream. That is higher than the 25 level it stood at to start the year but below levels it reached for much of last year. By contrast, the S&P 500 trades at 21 times earnings.\nWhile Nvidia has been the standout performer, it is not the only stock to benefit from enthusiasm about the profit potential for AI. Shares of other technology companies, including Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings, have also risen sharply this year.\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New YorkAdditional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York and Noel Randewich in Oakland, CaliforniaEditing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors have seen their investments in this high-flying semiconductor company multiply substantially in the past three years. After all, Nvidia stock has shot up an impressive 576% during this period, which means that an investment of $1,000 in its shares three years ago is now worth more than $6,750.\nThe stock market has rewarded Nvidia investors with such handsome gains thanks to the impressive growth in its top and bottom lines.\nNVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\nHowever, as the above chart indicates, Nvidia's revenue and earnings growth started taking off only from the second half of 2023 once customers started lining up to buy its artificial intelligence (AI) chips. The good part is that this catalyst could help Nvidia stock sustain its impressive momentum over the next three years as well. Let's look at the reasons why.\nWhen Nvidia released its results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on April 28) last month, it became clear that it continues to remain the dominant player in the lucrative AI chip market.\nThe company's revenue shot up a terrific 262% year over year to a record $26 billion. Non-GAAP earnings jumped 461% to $6.12 per share. The numbers were well ahead of what the market was forecasting. The positives didn't stop there, as Nvidia's revenue guidance of $28 billion for the current quarter means that its top line is set to more than double once again from the year-ago period's reading of $13.5 billion.\nThe company managed to deliver such terrific growth even though its current generation of Hopper AI chips is about to be replaced with the new Blackwell generation. Management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that it witnessed \"strong demand\" for the Hopper graphics processing units (GPUs).\nThe good part was that Nvidia was able to increase the supply of its previous generation H100 GPU so that it could fill more demand. However, the company also pointed out that the demand for its latest Hopper flagship -- the H200 processor -- was stronger than supply. Additionally, Nvidia is expecting that the demand for its Blackwell chips, which are already in production, will remain ahead of supply \"well into next year.\"\nWhat this means is that the demand for Nvidia's AI GPUs is so strong that the company is unable to manufacture enough chips. Even better, its competitors are unable to fill the supply void as Nvidia reportedly commands 60% of the advanced chip packaging capacity -- which is required to produce AI chips -- of its foundry partner. As a result, Nvidia continues to dominate the AI chip market with an estimated share of more than 95% as per some estimates.\nThe good part is that Nvidia's foundry partner TSMC is set to expand its advanced chip packaging capacity at an annual rate of 60% through 2026. This bodes well for Nvidia, as it should ideally be able to manufacture more AI chips and reduce lead times for customers waiting to get their hands on the company's hardware.\nHigher production should ideally translate into more revenue growth and allow Nvidia to maintain its solid share of the AI chip market that's expected to generate annual revenue of $400 billion in 2027 as compared to $45 billion last year, according to fellow chipmaker AMD.\nWe have seen that the market for AI chips is set to boom over the next three years. When combined with Nvidia's outstanding market share in this space, it is easy to see why analysts are expecting its top-line growth to take off over that time frame.\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\nNvidia finished the previous fiscal year with just under $61 billion in revenue, and the chart above indicates that its top line is forecasted to nearly triple over the next three years. However, certain analysts are expecting Nvidia's revenue to grow even faster by 2027 and outpace Wall Street's expectations.\nAs such, there is a good chance that Nvidia will continue to remain a top growth stock over the next three years as well. With shares of the company now trading at 42 times forward earnings, which is in line with the U.S. technology sector's average price-to-earnings ratio, buying Nvidia looks like a no-brainer considering the pace at which it is expected to grow over the next three years.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "AI titans Microsoft and Nvidia reportedly had a standoff over Microsoft's use of B200 AI GPUs in its own server rooms",
        "Author": "  Aaron Klotz ",
        "Text": "Nvidia is well known for its high-performance gaming GPUs and industry-leading AI GPUs. However, the trillion-dollar GPU manufacturer is also known for controlling how its GPUs are used beyond company walls. For example, it can be quite restrictive with its AIB partners' graphics card designs. Perhaps not surprisingly, this level of control also appears to extend beyond card partners over to AI customers, including Microsoft. The Information reports that there was a standoff between Microsoft and Nvidia over how Nvidia's new Blackwell B200 GPUs were to be installed in Microsoft's server rooms.  Nvidia has been aggressively pursuing ever larger pieces of the data center pie, which is immediately clear if you look at how it announced the Blackwell B200 parts. Multiple times during the presentation, Jensen Huang indicated that he doesn't think about individual GPUs any more \u2014 he thinks of the entire NVL72 rack as a GPU. It's a rather transparent effort to gain additional revenue from its AI offerings, and that extends to influencing how customers install their new B200 GPUs.  Previously, the customer was responsible for buying and building appropriate server racks to house the hardware. Now, Nvidia is pushing customers to buy individual racks and even entire SuperPods \u2014 all coming direct from Nvidia. Nvidia claims this will boost GPU performance, and there's merit to such talk considering all the interlinks between the various GPUs, servers, racks, and even SuperPods. But there's also a lot of dollar bills changing hands when you're building data centers at scale.  Nvidia's smaller customers might be ok with the company's offerings, but Microsoft wasn't. VP of Nvidia Andrew Bell reportedly asked Microsoft to buy a server rack design specifically for its new B200 GPUs that boasted a form factor a few inches different from Microsoft's existing server racks that are actively used in its data centers.  Microsoft pushed back on Nvidia's recommendation, revealing that the new server racks would prevent Microsoft from easily switching between Nvidia's AI GPUs and competing offerings such as AMD's MI300X GPUs. Nvidia eventually backed down and allowed Microsoft to use its own custom server racks for its B200 AI GPUs, but it's probably not the last such disagreement we'll see between the two megacorps.  To be clear, Nvidia supports both OCP's Open Rack (21-inch) and standard 19-inch EIA racks for MGX. Microsoft appears to use OCP racks, which are newer and should be better for density. Microsoft likely has a lot of existing infrastructure that continues to work well, and upgrading all of that would be quite expensive.  A dispute like this this is a sign of how large and valuable Nvidia has become over the span of just a year. Nvidia became the most valuable company earlier this week (briefly), and that title will likely change hands many times in the coming months and years. Server racks aren't the only area Nvidia wants to control, as the tech giant also controls how much GPU inventory gets allocated to each customer to maintain demand, and it's using its dominant position in the AI space to push its own software and networking systems to maintain its position as a market leader.  Nvidia is benefiting massively from the AI boom, which started when ChatGPT exploded in popularity one and a half years ago. Over that same timespan, Nvidia's AI-focused GPUs have become the GPU manufacturer's most in-demand and highest income generating products, leading to incredible financial success. Stock prices for Nvidia have soared and are currently over eight times higher than they were at the beginning of 2023, and over 2.5 times higher than at the start of 2024.  Nvidia continues to use all of this extra income to great effect. Its latest AI GPU, the Blackwell B200, will be the fastest graphics processing unit in the world for AI workloads. A \"single\" GB200 Superchip delivers up to a whopping 20 petaflops of compute performance (for sparse FP8) and is theoretically five times faster than its H200 predecessor. Of course GB200 is actually two B200 GPUs plus a Grace CPU all on a large daughterboard, and the B200 uses two large dies linked together for good measure. The 'regular' B200 GPU on the other hand only offers up to 9 petaflops FP4 (with sparsity), but even so that's a lot of number crunching prowess. It also delivers up to 2.25 petaflops of dense compute for FP16/BF16, which is what's used in AI training workloads.  As of June 20th, 2024, Nvidia stock has dropped slightly from its $140.76 high and closed at $126.57. We'll have to see what happens once Blackwell B200 begins shipping en masse. In the meantime, Nvidia continues to go all-in on AI.\n"

        "Text": "By Noel Randewich and Ankika Biswas\n(Reuters) - Nvidia became the world's most valuable company on Tuesday, dethroning tech heavyweight Microsoft as its high-end processors play a central role in a scramble to dominate artificial intelligence technology.\nShares of the chipmaker climbed 3.5% to $135.58, lifting its market capitalization to $3.335 trillion, just days after overtaking iPhone maker Apple to become the second most valuable company.\nMicrosoft's stock market value was $3.317 trillion as its shares dipped 0.45%.\nApple's stock slipped over 1%, leaving its value at $3.286 trillion.\nNvidia's stunning surge in market value over the past year has become emblematic of a Wall Street frenzy driven by optimism about emerging AI technology.\nWhile Nvidia's rally has lifted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to record highs, some investors worry that unbridled optimism about AI could evaporate if signs emerge of a slowdown in spending on the technology.\n\"It's Nvidia's market; we're all just trading in it,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief market strategist at Interactive Brokers.\nNvidia has also become by far the most traded company on Wall Street, with daily turnover recently averaging $50 billion, compared to around $10 billion each for Apple, Microsoft and Tesla, according to LSEG data. The chipmaker now accounts for about 16% of all trading in S&P 500 companies.\nNvidia's stock has nearly tripled so far this year, compared with a rise of about 19% in Microsoft shares, with demand for its top-of-the-line processors outpacing supply.\nTech giants Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Google-owner Alphabet are competing to build out their AI computing capabilities and add the technology to their products and services.\nAn insatiable appetite for Nvidia's AI processors, viewed as far superior to competitors' offerings, has left them in tight supply, and many investors view Nvidia as the greatest winner to date from surging AI development.\n\"Nvidia has been getting a lot of positive attention and has been doing a lot of things very correctly, but a small misstep is likely to cause a major correction in the stock, and investors should be careful,\" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in New York.\nTuesday's gain lifted Nvidia's stock to a record high and added over $110 billion to its market capitalization, equivalent to the entire value of Lockheed Martin .\nThe company's market value expanded from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in just nine months in February, while taking just over three months to hit $3 trillion in June.\nSince its blowout forecast about a year ago, the company has consistently breezed past Wall Street's lofty expectations for revenue and profit, with demand for its graphics processors far outstripping supply as companies rush to embed AI applications.\nNvidia executives said in May that demand for its Blackwell AI chips could exceed supply \"well into next year.\"\nSharp increases in analysts' expectations for Nvidia's future earnings have outpaced its stellar stock gains, resulting in a fall in the stock's earnings valuation.\nNvidia recently traded at 44 times expected earnings, down from over 84 about a year ago, LSEG data showed.\nIncreasing the appeal for its highly valued stock among individual investors, Nvidia last week split its stock 10-for-one.\n(Reporting by Shristi Achar, Medha Singh and Ankika Biswas in Bengaluru, and by Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Suzanne McGee and Stephen Culp in New York; Editing by Anil D'Silva, Shounak Dasgupta and Lisa Shumaker)\n"

        "Author": "  Howard Smith, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There has been almost nothing but good news from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) over the past four quarters. Many investors might not recall that Nvidia's revenue actually declined 13% year over year in the first quarter of its fiscal 2024 (which ended April 30, 2023).\nFast-forward to fiscal 2025's first quarter, when revenue exploded higher by more than 260% year over year. In conjunction with that growth, the stock price has more than tripled in the past year, and investors continue to receive positive signs that the business will keep growing. The latest bullish news should have investors thinking Nvidia still has a long runway to increase sales in its data center segment.\nAfter such a huge jump in sales over the past year, some investors may be wondering if Nvidia's revenue growth may have peaked. But recent news from its fellow tech company Broadcom suggests that the addressable market for artificial intelligence (AI) equipment is broad and still growing.\nBroadcom supplies semiconductor solutions and infrastructure that AI requires. Its products include switching solutions, accelerators, server storage equipment, and on-site and cloud connectivity offerings.\nLike Nvidia, Broadcom recently reported strong results for its latest quarter. Revenue from its AI-related products set a record, and made up a quarter of total sales as the top line increased by more than 40% year over year. But it's something Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said during management's conference call with investors that should make Nvidia investors more bullish.\nTan admitted that Broadcom wasn't going to try to compete with Nvidia in its leading position as a supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide AI systems with computing power. He acknowledged, however, that Nvidia was increasingly becoming a competitor to Broadcom on the networking side. Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell platform is just the first step. Speaking of Nvidia, Tan noted, \"They are trying to create a platform that is probably end-to-end very integrated.\"\nThat should make Nvidia investors confident that the AI spending being directed to the company can continue to grow for the foreseeable future.\nIt's notable how much Nvidia has already dominated its competitors in reaping the investments that companies are making in data center computing power.\nNow consider that there is yet another segment of Nvidia's business with the potential to take a similar growth trajectory. Nvidia's automotive and robotics segment has more than doubled its revenues over the last two years. While its automotive segment still contributes only a minor portion of total sales, self-driving technology is advancing and numerous automakers are already Nvidia customers.\nSeveral Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers, autonomous driving technology companies, and global automakers are using Nvidia's Drive platforms. In its latest earnings report, Nvidia also noted that \"an array of partners are using Nvidia generative AI technologies to transform in-vehicle experiences.\"\nMost recently, U.S.-based EV maker Rivian Automotive said it would be using Nvidia's Drive Orin processors to increase computing power and improve the performance of its R1 platform vehicles.\nWhile the potential remains immense for Nvidia to grow sales and earnings, investors shouldn't ignore the fact that some of that expected growth is already baked into the company's current valuation. Some investors believe the stock has already risen beyond a reasonable valuation and is due for a major correction.\nWhile earnings are up by more than 600% so far this year, the stock followed a similar trajectory. With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 50 and a price-to-sales ratio of nearly 30 based on this year's projected revenue, Nvidia will need to deliver significantly more growth before the stock looks like a bargain again.\nWhile there are realistic paths for that to occur, the stock's rise could pause as the market waits to see what actually happens. The stock could even dip. Aggressive investors still might want to have Nvidia in their portfolios based on both its past successes and the potential for more. However, after its meteoric rise, this stock is a good candidate to buy in stages rather than deploying all the funds you plan to commit to it all at once.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the poster child for the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company supplies the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are critical components in AI systems, driving its stock price into the stratosphere. Since the advent of generative AI early last year, Nvidia's revenue has soared 330%, while its net income surged 952%. This performance, in turn, has pushed its stock price up 488% (as of this writing).\nAs a result, the stock price currently sits above $1,100 per share, putting it out of reach of many everyday investors -- but all that's about to change. Nvidia's long-awaited 10-for-1 stock split goes into effect after the market closes today.\nLet's review the details of this split and what investors can expect in the days and weeks to come.\nWhen Nvidia announced the results of its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), the company's unprecedented winning streak continued. Revenue jumped 262% year over year to a record $26 billion, while earnings per share (EPS) rocketed 629% to $5.98. The results were led by record data center revenue, which includes AI chips, which climbed 427% to $22.6 billion. This stunning performance wasn't a one-time thing but rather represented the fourth consecutive quarterly performance featuring triple-digit sales and profit gains, pushing its stock price north of $1,000.\nManagement announced a 10-for-1 stock split \"to make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors.\" The split is scheduled to take place after the market close on Friday, June 7. For each share investors own, they will receive nine additional shares. The stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on Monday, June 10. For each share of Nvidia stock a shareholder owns -- currently selling for roughly $1,100 per share (as of this writing) -- post-split, investors will hold 10 shares worth $110 each, so the total value of the investment won't change as a result of the split.\nWhile a stock split itself doesn't fundamentally change anything about the underlying business, stock splits tend to generate a lot of excitement among investors -- and for good reason. Data shows that in the year following a split, the stocks in question tend to outperform the broader market.\nA study conducted by Bank of America Global Research revealed that in the 12 months following a stock split, companies that have undergone a split generated returns of 25.4%, on average, compared to gains of 11.9% for the S&P 500.\nIt's important to note that the stronger stock price gains aren't necessarily caused by the stock split itself, but rather by the strong business and operating performance that fueled the stock price increases in the first price, which ultimately led to the stock split.\nThe data suggests that post-split, Nvidia stock will likely continue to outperform the broader market.\nFor investors wondering what's to come for Nvidia, the future looks bright. For the company's upcoming fiscal second quarter, management is guiding for revenue of $28 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 107%, suggesting the company's growth spurt will continue.\nThat isn't surprising. The adoption of generative AI is expected to continue by leaps and bounds, adding between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the economy in the coming years, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\nMuch has been made about the potential for competition, which could encroach on Nvidia's windfall. While that certainly bears watching, the company's robust growth rate suggests that Nvidia remains the gold standard for AI processing. Until its rivals come up with a solution that can compete in terms of performance and cost, that's unlikely to change anytime soon.\nFinally, Nvidia's meteoric rise has fueled a commensurate increase in its valuation. The stock is currently trading for 43 times forward earnings, considerably higher than a multiple of 27 for the S&P 500. While that might seem prohibitively expensive, its valuation should be considered in the context of Nvidia's growth and future potential. Over the past 10 years, Nvidia stock has gained 24,380%, compared to 174% for the S&P 500. This helps illustrate why Nvidia is deserving of its otherwise hefty premium.\nIt also shows why Nvidia stock is a buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's no question about it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the hottest stock of the generative artificial intelligence (AI) era.\nThe graphics processing unit (GPU) and AI hardware specialist has added more than $2 trillion to its market capitalization since ChatGPT was launched, well ahead of any other stock, and its shares are up by roughly 700% since the start of 2023.\nWhile some billionaires caught on to that trend early, buying Nvidia shares as the disruptive potential of generative AI became clear, now it seems that many of those investors are beginning to think its surge has run out of steam. According to hedge-fund tracker WhaleWisdom, more top investors cut their stakes in Nvidia than added to them in the first quarter: 207 hedge funds increased their holdings of Nvidia in Q1, down from 269 in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, 336 hedge funds reduced their holdings in the chip giant, roughly 60% more than the number of hedge funds that added to their positions.\nAmong the billionaires selling Nvidia stock were Ken Griffin of Citadel, Israel Englander of Millennium Management, and Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Group.\nThat pattern seems to be a sign that there's fatigue surrounding the stock, and these hedge fund managers are taking the opportunity to lock in their profits.\nHedge fund managers' 13F filings don't come with commentary, but investors can make a few educated guesses as to why these Wall Street luminaries are selling this stock.\nTaking some profits off the table seems like the most obvious reason, especially considering recent chatter that capital gains tax rates on the wealthy could be increased. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said that was one of the reasons his company sold shares of Apple in the first quarter.\nAnother reason is that greater competition is on the way. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have both launched competing data center GPUs, and tech companies such as Meta Platforms and Microsoft are also developing their own AI-capable chips in-house to reduce their dependence on Nvidia.\nOne billionaire investor, Stanley Druckenmiller, explained his decision to start unwinding his stake in Nvidia, saying that much of what his firm had recognized earlier in the stock has now been recognized by the broader market. Indeed, Nvidia's dominance of the AI chip sector and its skyrocketing growth have become clear.\nThe hedge fund managers that are selling Nvidia stock are buying a wide range of companies in its place, but you might be surprised to learn that one of the choices to replace Nvidia has been Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F).\nCitadel, Millennium Management, and Tudor Investment Group were all among the hedge funds that bought Ford last quarter. Citadel added 5.45 million shares and Millennium Management added 7.34 million shares. Tudor added 1.76 million shares, but that made Ford one of its biggest buys in the quarter.\nFord was also more favored than not among hedge funds: 116 funds added to their stakes in the automaker while only 92 sold its shares.\nFord has struggled in recent times, but it could be sitting at the intersection of a number of favorable trends. First, pure-play electric vehicle (EV) makers are struggling as demand growth for EVs is slowing, and valuations in that sector are coming down. That has made traditional auto stocks more popular, and while Ford's EV business hasn't yet turned a profit, the company is finding success with hybrids.\nFord should also benefit from the expected decline in interest rates later this year, which will make cars more affordable. Finally, the company has growth potential in areas like EVs, hybrids, and autonomy, and the stock is cheap, trading at a forward P/E of 6.\nStill, Ford has a low valuation for a reason. Investors assume it will be disrupted by fast-growing rivals like Tesla.\nHowever, for investors looking to rotate out of a growth stock like Nvidia and into a cyclical dividend stock with upside potential, Ford looks like a good choice, especially given its dividend yield of 5% at the current share price.\nBefore you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ford Motor Company wasn\u2019t one of them.

Shipments of Nvidia's GPUs for desktops totaled 7.66 million units, up from 7.6 million in Q4 2023 and around 5.26 million in Q1 2023.\nBy contrast, AMD saw a 7% decrease in market share quarter-over-quarter but a modest increase in its yearly market share as the company's shipments fell by 41% from the previous quarter, but rose by 39% compared to the previous year. The company shipped around 1.04 million desktop discrete GPUs in Q1 2024, down from 1.81 million in the previous quarter and up from 0.75 million in the same quarter a year ago.\nIntel, which entered the AIB market in Q3 2022 with its Arc A770 and A750 models continues to struggle for a foothold against established competitors like Nvidia and AMD. The company's shipments in Q1 2024 were negligible, based on data from Jon Peddie Research.\n\"We and the industry have been hoping for a return to seasonality, which was the hallmark of the PC industry for so many decades,\" said Dr. Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Research. The research firm head went on to explain that the GPU market was strongly disrupted by the recession in 2007-2008, and never fully recovered before the ensuing cryto-craze, COVID pandemic, and the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\"In 2023, we saw four quarters of welcomed growth, and when Q1 2024 was down a bit, no one panicked, as it looked like a return to seasonality \u2014 Q1 always used to be flat to down,\" commented Peddie. \"Therefore, one would expect Q2 2024, a traditional quarter, to also be down. But, all the vendors are predicting a growth quarter, mostly driven by AI training systems in hyperscalers. Whereas AI trainers use a GPU, the demand for them can steal parts from the gaming segment. So, for Q2, we expect to see a flat to low gaming AIB result and another increase in AI trainer GPU shipments. The new normality is no normality.\"\n"

        "Text": "Good morning. Nvidia on Tuesday surpassed Microsoft to become the most valuable company in the world, reaching a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion to edge out Microsoft\u2019s $3.32 trillion.\nIn the first week of June, CEO Jensen Huang saw his firm hit a $3 trillion market cap for the first time, surpassing Apple. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker, whose highly sought-after semiconductors help power AI-related computing tasks at massive data centers, has dominated the market. Over the past year, shares of Nvidia have surged more than 200%.\n\u201cThe Godfather of AI, Jensen, and Nvidia are leading this AI revolution, and it\u2019s a race to $4 trillion market cap\u2014with Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple battling for the No. 1 spot,\u201d Dan Ives, managing partner at Wedbush Securities, told me on Tuesday.\nHuang cofounded Nvidia in 1993 with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. About 34.5% of the S&P 500\u2019s market cap gains so far this year can be attributed to Nvidia alone, according to Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k, Fortune previously reported.\nOn May 22, Nvidia reported results for the quarter ended April 28, and it showed no signs of slowing down. On the earnings call, Nvidia EVP and CFO Colette Kress said revenue for the quarter was $26 billion, up 18% sequentially and up 262% year on year, and well above the company's outlook of $24 billion.\n\u201cThe CFO leadership at Nvidia from Colette Kress has been instrumental in Nvidia's success with Wall Street, and is key to Jensen's vision,\u201d Ives told me. \u201cShe is extremely well respected both internally at Nvidia and across the tech industry.\u201d\nKress joined Nvidia in 2013 as CFO after serving nearly 25 years in a range of finance roles at major technology companies. She previously was CFO of Cisco\u2019s Business Technology and Operations Finance organization, and she spent 13 years at Microsoft, including four years as CFO of the server and tools division.\nI had the opportunity to sit down with Kress in 2022, and we discussed how the rest of her career prepared her to move to Nvidia.\nHere\u2019s what she told me:\n\u201cMy career background did serve me well. When I started at Nvidia, it was the smallest company that I\u2019d ever worked for. It\u2019s gotten quite large, but the focus is on how do you think about the future and make sure we\u2019re ready for it to scale?\n\u201cSome of the techniques and processes have to be transformed over time as the company scales. How do we digitize manual processes? Our fast growth rate has put that front and center for us. Particularly, in my role leading finance, and the sister and brother organizations around me, I\u2019m looking to them to say, \u2018Hey, we need to revise a process, how the functions work together, to create digital solutions.\u2019\n\u201cWhen looking back at my career of 30-plus years, what\u2019s fascinating now is there are so many different ways to do things that never existed\u2014even at some of the largest companies that I\u2019ve worked at in the past.\"\nShe now works at the largest company. And she's clearly a big reason why.\nSheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "The moment many investors were waiting for is finally here: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is set to split its stock on June 7. This comes after the stock soared more than 3,000% in five years, surging past $1,000 in recent days.\nThis showstopping stock performance is thanks to the company's dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. The tech giant sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power some of the most crucial AI tasks, such as training and inferencing, as well as a wide variety of other AI products and services. This has pushed Nvidia's revenue to record levels quarter after quarter.\nSo, why are investors so excited about the Nvidia stock split? The operation involves offering additional shares to current holders -- bringing down the price of each individual share, and therefore making the per-share price more affordable for a broader range of investors. Let's take an in-depth look at what to expect from the upcoming stock split -- and from Nvidia afterward.\nFirst, as mentioned, a stock split lowers the price of each share. But this sort of operation doesn't change the overall market value of the company or of your holding if you already own the stock. So it's simply a mechanical operation, and that's why a stock split in and of itself isn't a reason to buy or sell a particular stock.\nStock splits aren't known to help or hurt stock performance in the days following the operation. But they represent good long-term moves for companies in the situation of Nvidia: growth players with strong prospects that have seen their shares soar to extraordinarily high levels.\nFor example, the price level of $1,000 may make it difficult for some investors to buy the stock unless they have access to fractional shares -- and certain brokerages don't offer these. So, by splitting its stock, Nvidia makes it easier right away and in the months (and possibly even years) to come for a greater number of investors to buy the shares.\nNow, let's talk about the operation itself. Nvidia is doing a forward stock split, which is the most common sort of split. This involves offering more shares to current holders.\nNvidia's 10-for-1 split means that if you hold one Nvidia share, you'll receive an extra nine as part of the operation. In order to get the extra shares, you must be an Nvidia shareholder on the record date, which is June 6. (That said, if you buy or sell the shares the next day, the right for new shares transfers to the new owner.)\nNvidia will distribute the new shares at the end of the next trading day, which is Friday, June 7. And the stock will begin trading at the split-adjusted price on June 10. Considering today's share price of $1,095, the price on June 10 should be around $109.\nIf you're an Nvidia shareholder, you don't have to lift a finger before, during, or after the stock split, and you'll automatically find yourself with a greater number of shares once the operation is complete. If you're about to buy Nvidia stock this week, you can go ahead with your purchase as usual -- and you'll also receive the extra shares. So the stock split doesn't require you to do anything in particular -- you can buy or sell Nvidia as you generally would at any point ahead of or during this operation.\nNvidia stock, as of Monday, will start trading at a lower price per share, but don't expect the stock to surge for this reason. As I mentioned, stock splits aren't catalysts for stock performance. That said, Nvidia could continue to gain in the coming weeks and months due to its earnings performance and demand for its chips and related products. The company is set to release the Blackwell architecture and related chip -- potentially game-changing innovations -- later this year, and anticipation of this may keep the shares climbing.\nAll of this means that, yes, this is an exciting time for Nvidia and its shareholders, and even though the stock split itself won't impact share performance, it's still a smart long-term move. And in the short-term time frame of this week, the stock split surely will keep investors' eyes on Nvidia.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Lewis Krauskopf ",
        "Text": "By Lewis Krauskopf\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The huge rally in Nvidia Corp's shares has investors weighing whether to cash in, hold on for more gains or chase a stock that has tripled during the past year.\nNvidia this week briefly became the largest U.S. company by market value on the back of a more than 1,000% surge in share price since October 2022. It is up 206% in the last 12 months.\nNvidia bulls say more gains are coming. The Santa Clara, California company stands at the forefront of a massive technological shift as the dominant provider of chips to support artificial intelligence applications. Revenues are expected to double this fiscal year to $120 billion and rise to $160 billion in the following year. Microsoft, by comparison, is expected to grow revenues by about 16% for its fiscal year.\nThe stock\u2019s eye-popping performance is drawing in investors afraid of missing out on more gains. Yet it has also made Nvidia\u2019s shares more richly valued: its forward price-to-earnings ratio, for example, has grown by 80% this year. That could make the company\u2019s shares more vulnerable to sharp pullbacks when bad news hits.\n\"What it's done in the past ... shouldn't be driving the investment decision,\" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services. \"However, on a stock like Nvidia, it's awfully hard to have that not be a factor in the investment decision because you have this chasing feeling.\"\nONWARDS AND UPWARDS\nSo far, Nvidia\u2019s share price trajectory has rewarded bullish investors and punished doubters. The stock is up 164% in 2024, as its market value has surged to over $3.2 trillion, briefly putting it ahead of Microsoft and Apple this week.\nOptimistic investors point to Nvidia\u2019s dominance of the AI-chip sector as a key reason for their bullishness.\nThe high performance of Nvidia's chips makes them difficult to replace in AI data centers. Adding to this lead is its proprietary software framework that developers use to program AI processors.\nIvana Delevska, founder and chief investment officer of Spear Invest, remains bullish on the outlook for Nvidia shares, as she expects upside to earnings beyond what Wall Street analysts are forecasting.\nNvidia is the top holding in the Spear Alpha ETF, at nearly 14% of the fund.\n\"If the (stock) price has gone up like it has but the earnings haven't really moved, yeah, we would be very worried,\" Delevska said. But, \"where we are here it has pretty solid earnings support.\"\nIndeed, Nvidia\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 45 is only modestly higher than its five-year average P/E of 41, even after growing from 25 at the start of the year, according to LSEG Datastream. At the same time, that valuation is down from more than 84 about a year ago.\nTom Plumb, president of Plumb Funds, said he believes the opportunity for Nvidia's chips beyond AI is underappreciated. The firm has held Nvidia shares for more than seven years and it is the largest position in its two funds.\n\"What we really are talking about is data and access to data,\" Plumb said. \"And they have the fastest, smartest chip that allows that.\"\nCAUTION AHEAD?\nOthers have grown wary about Nvidia\u2019s prospects of delivering stunning gains in the future.\nNvidia has a \"truly revolutionary\" product and has posted \"unprecedented growth,\" said Gil Luria, an analyst with D.A. Davidson. However, he has a \"neutral\" rating on the stock and a $90 price target, compared with the stock's price of $130.78 on Thursday.\nLooking ahead several years, Luria said he doubts Nvidia's customers will spend enough to drive the Wall Street earnings estimates that support the company's valuation.\n\"The caution on Nvidia comes from the longer-term outlook,\" Luria said. \"This type of performance is very hard to maintain.\"\nBillionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller said last month that he reduced his big bet in Nvidia in 2024, telling CNBC television that \"AI might be a little overhyped now, but underhyped long term.\"\nCarlson, of Horizon Investment Services, considers Nvidia a \"buy,\" but because of the stock's relatively expensive valuation, it would not make the cut to be included in Horizon's roughly 30-stock portfolios.\nOther concerns include eventual competition that erodes Nvidia's market-leading position. Tech giants Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Google-owner Alphabet are competing to build their AI computing capabilities and add the technology to their products and services.\nAnalysts at Morningstar, which has a $105 fair value on the stock, said leading vendors such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms will eventually seek to reduce their reliance on the company and diversify their supplier base.\n\"Nvidia dominates AI today and the sky is the limit for the company\u2019s profitability if it can maintain this lead over the next decade,\u201d Morningstar's Brian Colello wrote this month. \u201cHowever, any semblance of the successful development of alternatives could meaningfully limit Nvidia\u2019s upside.\u201d\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Gerry Doyle)\n"

        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "With all eyes on the Federal Reserve and earnings season, it's possible investors missed what was, arguably, the most-important data release of the quarter five weeks ago.\nOn May 15, institutions with at least $100 million in assets under management filed Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a snapshot to investors of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful investors have been buying and selling. It's effectively a blueprint that allows investors to see what stocks, industries, and trends have been piquing the interest of top-tier money managers.\nAs should be no surprise, first-quarter 13Fs showed a lot of trading activity in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\nCompanies involved in AI are using software and systems to handle tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. What gives AI such broad-reaching utility is the ability for software and AI-driven systems to learn without human intervention. This evolution of AI systems should improve efficiency and allow for new tasks to be learned.\nDespite the big-dollar potential associated with AI -- the analysts at PwC foresee AI adding close to $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030 -- Wall Street's billionaire investors have mixed views about the companies embracing this technology.\nBased on the latest round of 13Fs, which covers trading activity during the March-ended quarter, a number of prominent billionaires were active sellers of AI kingpin Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). At the same time, these very same billionaire money managers were buying shares of four other promising artificial intelligence stocks.\nSince the start of 2023, shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed by 802%, as of the closing bell on June 14, which translates into nearly $2.9 trillion in added market value. This helps to explain why it was a no-brainer for the company's board to approve a 10-for-1 stock split, which was completed on June 7.\nNvidia's outperformance has everything to do with its graphics processing units (GPUs) dominating in high-compute data centers. According to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, Nvidia was responsible for 3.76 million of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped last year.\nFurthermore, demand for Nvidia's AI-accelerated chips has completely overwhelmed supply. This has sent the selling price of Nvidia's GPUs skyward and meaningfully increased its adjusted gross margin.\nBut in spite of Nvidia's first-mover advantages, two prominent billionaires dumped more than 2 million shares of the company during the first quarter (total shares sold in parenthesis):\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares)\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares)\nWhile simple profit-taking might explain some of this selling activity, there may be other catalysts behind Laffont's and Griffin's decision to decisively reduce their respective stakes in Nvidia.\nAs I've pointed out numerous times before, history has not been kind to next-big-thing innovations over the last 30 years. Not one game-changing innovation has avoided a bubble-bursting event. Investors commonly overestimate how quickly a new technology or innovation will become mainstream, and they're likely doing it again with artificial intelligence. Since no company has benefited more directly from AI, Nvidia would probably be the hardest hit if the AI bubble bursts.\nIt's also going to be increasingly difficult for Nvidia to sustain its growth trajectory and adjusted gross margin with competition coming at it from all angles. Since it can't meet all of its orders, external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel can be market share winners by default.\nTo add to this point, Nvidia's top customers are all working on AI-GPUs of their own. Even if these chips are simply to complement Nvidia's prized H100 GPU, it signals a purposeful lessening of reliance on the company's data center GPU architecture over time.\nBut while Philippe Laffont was reducing Coatue's stake in Nvidia by 68% during the first quarter, he and his team were simultaneously gobbling up shares of AI networking solutions company Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), as well as cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). Coatue purchased 416,460 shares of Broadcom and 2,556,774 shares of Salesforce.\nBroadcom, which announced a 10-for-1 forward-stock split of its own last week, is a rising star in AI-accelerated networking solutions. The company's Jericho 3 chip has the ability to connect up to 32,000 GPUs, which can optimize processing speeds and reduce tail latency. In plainer English, Broadcom's AI solutions are expediting the processing needs of enterprise data centers responsible for training large language models (LLMs) and running generative AI solutions.\nBut Broadcom has plenty of momentum outside of the AI arena, too. It's still a dominant player in next-generation wireless chips and accessories used in smartphones, and also provides an assortment of connectivity solutions and sensors for industrial equipment and new vehicles. The company's backlog and cash-flow consistency are tough to top in the tech sector.\nMeanwhile, Salesforce is harnessing the power of AI to personalize its marketing efforts, automate certain repetitive tasks (e.g., data entry), and help it target new customers to boost its own sales. CRM software is, after all, designed to enhance existing customer relationships and grow sales. Predicting which existing clients might purchase a new product or service can be improved with AI.\nThere's little doubt Salesforce's long-term success has to do with its dominance in the CRM space. A recent report from IDC found that Salesforce accounted for a whopping 21.7% of global cloud-based CRM spending in 2023. With over three times the market share of its next-closest competitor (Microsoft at 5.9%), it should have no trouble retaining this competitive edge for many years to come.\nSince its inception in 1990, Ken Griffin's hedge fund has generated $74 billion in total gains. No other hedge fund has come close to matching this mark. That's what makes Citadel selling roughly 2.46 million shares of Nvidia all the more interesting -- as well as Griffin and his teams' decision to buy two AI-inspired \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\nDuring the March-ended quarter, Citadel Advisors added 352,453 shares of e-commerce titan Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), as well as 747,887 shares of tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\nIn addition to designing its own AI chips, Amazon is aggressively deploying generative AI solutions across its various operating segments. For instance, it's made generative AI solutions available to its Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers, who are able to use the technology to do everything from customize AI virtual assistants to train LLMs. AWS is one of Amazon's fastest-growing segments, and is often responsible for the lion's share of its operating income.\nDon't overlook subscription services or advertising, either. Amazon attracts in the neighborhood of 2.5 billion visitors to its site each month, which yields quite a bit of ad revenue. Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has more than likely added to this total since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of Thursday Night Football.\nAs for Apple, it made waves during its 2024 developer conference when it introduced \"Apple Intelligence\" -- the company's collective term for a series of AI-inspired upgrades to its various products and services. This includes everything from emoji generation based on entered text to the integration of OpenAI's virtual chatbot ChatGPT-4o later this year.\nMore so than any of the companies mentioned here, Apple brings cash-flow predictability to the table. It has an extremely loyal customer base, a well-known brand, and has often led with innovation. Apple has also repurchased $674 billion worth of its common stock since 2013 began, which is more than any other public company. These buybacks have undoubtedly helped to increase its earnings per share and made the company more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Given the headlines about Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock's minor pullback, one would think the sky was falling. Shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader dropped 6.7% on Monday to close at $118.11. This was the third consecutive trading day that shares declined, bringing the total pullback to 12.9% since the stock closed at an all-time high of $135.58 last Tuesday. (The market was closed on Wednesday for the Juneteenth holiday.)\nNvidia stock has merely given up its gains from less than the last two weeks. Shares on Monday closed at their highest level since Tuesday, June 14. Moreover, despite the pullback, the stock is still up 139% so far this year, 180% over the one-year period, and 519% over the last three years.\nStocks never go straight up forever. There will always be pullbacks of varying magnitudes. Given Nvidia stock's rapid run-up, it's no surprise some investors are taking some profits off the table.\nIn April, I wrote about the main qualitative differences between Nvidia stock now and Cisco Systems stock before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. That article was in response to a good number of articles comparing the two situations.\nNow that Nvidia stock is pulling back, more of these Cisco-Nvidia type of comparisons are probably coming. This article delves into two key quantitative differences between the two situations.\nCisco stock skyrocketed in the 1990s despite the company's gross, operating, and profit margins steadily shrinking for many years. It's no surprise that Cisco stock plummeted when the dot-com bubble burst because its rise was not supported by the company's business performance.\nA main reason for any company's margins to decline is increased competition stemming from moats that are not sufficient to keep competitors at bay. Indeed, in its annual reports, Cisco attributed \"continued pricing pressure seen from competitors in certain product areas\" as a key reason for its gross margin decline from fiscal 1998 to fiscal 1999 and also from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000.\nNow, let's look at Nvidia's stock and margin performances.\nNvidia stock's surge has been supported by expanding margins. Granted, the company had a recent year-plus period where margins declined, but that was due to the macroeconomic environment, and its margins have since come roaring back. Over the long term, Nvidia's margins have trended upward -- and currently, they are at record highs.\nThe PEG is a much better stock valuation metric than the more commonly used price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio because it takes a company's earnings growth into account. A stock's PEG is calculated by dividing its P/E ratio by the company's earnings growth. For instance, if a stock's P/E is 40 and a company's earnings per share increased 40% over the last year, its PEG is 1.0. As a rough rule of thumb, a PEG of 1.0 indicates a stock is about fairly valued, while PEGs over 1.0 suggest a stock could be overvalued. That said, PEGs will vary considerably by industry and other factors.\nCisco's stock was very overvalued for most of its trading history before the stock reached its all-time high in March 2000. Its valuation was particularly bloated in 1999, the year before its stock plunged. Its PEG was over 7.5 in early 1999, and then it had no PEG (which means that earnings or earnings growth were negative), and then its PEG surged above 9 very soon before the stock's crash.\nNvidia's current PEG is well under 1.0. What its really low PEG is telling us is that, collectively, the market expects that Nvidia's near-term earnings growth will significantly slow. No doubt, it won't be able up to keep up the torrid pace of its recent year-over-year earnings growth. That said, it seems to me that the market is underestimating Nvidia's earnings growth potential.\nGranted, Nvidia's data center platform's powerful growth will slow down. But AI is still in the early innings, so this AI-driven platform still has huge growth potential. Moreover, Nvidia is not a one-trick pony. Self-driving cars are coming -- and when they fully arrive, Nvidia's auto platform's revenue and earnings should soar.\nDespite all the headlines over many years proclaiming Nvidia stock being very overvalued, that's just not been the case. At least not for more than relatively brief periods.\nThe key thing for long-term investors to remember: Nothing has changed fundamentally for Nvidia since its stock hit an all-time high last week. The company's long-term growth prospects and AI's long-term growth prospects remain unchanged.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sweta Killa ",
        "Text": "Amid the continued excitement around artificial intelligence, NVIDIA NVDA has been on an incredible surge with no signs of a slowdown. The chipmaker topped $3 trillion in market cap, surpassing Apple AAPL and becoming the second-most valuable company in the United States. NVIDIA hit the $1 trillion mark in May 2023 and reached $2 trillion by February 2024, surpassing Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL.NVIDIA stock has risen more than 140% year to date and 200% over the past year. It is by far the biggest outperformer among the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), a solid Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAfter this stellar run, many investors are concerned about the sustainability of its growth trajectory. But NVIDIA is primed for more growth in the months ahead, given solid company fundamentals. Let\u2019s delve deeper to find out the reasons.\nNVIDIA has been at the forefront of technology companies racing to build AI into their products and services. NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said, \u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun \u2014 companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center \u2014 AI factories \u2014 to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence.\u201dNVIDIA has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, which are attracting billions of dollars in spending from big cloud vendors. Its next-generation GPU chip is expected to drive another round of massive growth for the chip maker. Last weekend, the AI chipmaker unveiled a high-powered version of its Blackwell chip \u2014 called the Blackwell Ultra \u2014 slated to release in 2025, followed by a new AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026. The company will debut an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027. Its first Blackwell processors are slated for delivery later this year, replacing the widely popular Hopper generative AI chips.While NVIDIA's GPUs are unmatched for training AI models, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Intel are pushing forward with their own AI chips that will heighten competition. NVIDIA is also facing increasing competition from its own customers, such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft, who are striving to reduce their reliance on NVIDIA chips to cut down on capital expenditures. However, these companies will take time to garner market share.\nNVIDIA sparked a retail frenzy following the 10-for-1 stock split news. At the close of the market today, NVDA will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split, which means that for each NVIDIA share that an investor owns, they will receive an extra nine after the split is completed. Thus, NVIDIA\u2019s stockholders will receive a higher number of shares at lower prices. This will make its shares more affordable to a wider range of investors, including the ones who make small trades, and increase liquidity.In a stock split, the company increases the number of shares, reducing the share price. However, the total dollar value of all shares outstanding remains the same and doesn\u2019t affect the company\u2019s valuation.The stock split will also likely pave the way for NVIDIA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, like Amazon, which joined the index earlier this year after undergoing a 20-for-1 stock split in June 2022.\nThe AI chipmaker reported blockbuster first-quarter fiscal 2025 results, topping both earnings and revenue estimates. The blockbuster results were driven by incredible demand for NVIDIA\u2019s electric circuits, known as graphics processing units (GPUs), and data centers. Data Center revenues jumped 427% year over year to a record $22.6 billion, buoyed by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform.For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the graphics chipmaker provided a bullish revenue outlook of around $28 billion, plus or minus 2%.NVIDIA saw solid earnings estimate revisions of $2.79 and $5.25 over the past 30 days for fiscal 2025 and 2026, respectively. Its earnings surprise history is good, as it delivered an earnings surprise of 18.43%, on average, in the last four quarters.\nAfter an explosive surge over the past year, NVIDIA\u2019s valuation does not seem overstretched, given that its earnings are growing faster than the share price. Though NVIDIA is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 47.79 versus the industry average of 46.06, it is relatively cheap compared to its rival chipmaker AMD having a P/E ratio of 63.62.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWall Street analysts are going more bullish on NVIDIA and continue to boost their price targets. This week, Bank of America called NVIDIA a \"top pick,\" reiterating its buy rating on the stock and raising its price target to $1,500 from $1,320. As the chipmaker is accelerating its product upgrade cycle, the analyst believes the move will \"continue to bolster NVIDIA\u2019s AI leadership position.\" Post-earnings, at least 28 of the 58 brokerage firms have raised their price targets on the stock, according to the recent LSEG data.\nNVIDIA is expected to continue to dominate the AI chips market with its flagship AI GPUs and its CUDA software. The stock will start trading on a split-adjusted basis at market open on Jun 10. The split will not change the company's underlying value but is expected to make the stock more appealing to retail investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock Is Up 174% This Year. That's a Big Problem for the Average S&P 500 Stock (and Some Investors).",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has returned 174% in 2024, and its market capitalization has increased from $1.2 trillion to $3.3 trillion. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has returned 15% and its market capitalization has increased from $40 trillion to $46 trillion. Put differently, Nvidia is responsible for more than one-third of the gains in the S&P 500 this year.\nAs a result, the average S&P 500 stock trails the index by 10.7%, the worst underperformance since 1990, according to The Wall Street Journal. That means investors without exposure to Nvidia have found it exceptionally difficult to beat the market this year.\nInvestors can learn a few important lessons from the situation, and they can take steps to avoid a similar problem in the future. Read on to learn more.\nSome investors may have sold or avoided Nvidia due to concerns about valuation. Shares have surged 608% since the chipmaker reported financial results for Q4 of fiscal 2023 (ended January 29, 2023), and that much price appreciation compressed into such a short period usually means the price-to-earnings ratio has expanded. But that is not the case with Nvidia.\nNvidia's earnings per share increased 882% between Q4 of fiscal 2023 and Q1 of fiscal 2025 (ended April 30, 2024), outpacing the share price appreciation. As a result, Nvidia stock actually trades at a cheaper price-to-earnings multiple today than it did when the company reported financial results five quarters ago.\nAdditionally, while the current valuation of 79.3 times earnings looks expensive, valuation must be considered alongside growth. Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 33% annually to $4.95 per diluted share by fiscal 2028 (ends January 30, 2028). If that number is divided into its current price-to-earnings multiple, the result is a PEG ratio of 2.4.\nThat is not necessarily cheap, per se, but it is cheaper than some mega-cap stocks. For instance, using the same methodology, Apple has a PEG ratio of 3.1 and Microsoft has a PEG ratio of 2.8.\nAnother argument against Nvidia (and the broader stock market) is that artificial intelligence (AI) is overhyped, and that irrational euphoria surrounding the technology has created a stock market bubble. Some pessimists even compare the current market environment to the dot-com crash. But that comparison is inaccurate.\nIn January 2000, the five largest technology companies traded at an average valuation of 59 times forward earnings. Today, the five largest technology companies trade at an average valuation 37 times forward earnings. Additionally, the five largest technology companies today are expected to grow earnings 42% this year, while the five largest technology companies in 2000 were expected to grow earnings 30% in that year, according to JPMorgan Chase.\nTo be fair, the S&P 500 does trade at 21 times forward earnings, a premium to the five-year average of 19.2 times forward earnings, and enthusiasm about AI has undoubtedly played a role. But that does not mean AI is an overhyped technology destined to disappoint. It simply means the market is going through the normal phases of the Gartner Hype Cycle: Stocks first move too high, then move too low, before finally settling into a gradual upward slope.\nThe internet is an example of a technology that has been through the cycle. Naysayers labeled the internet a fad, and some experts expected it to fail. Economist Paul Krugman predicted it would have no more economic impact than the fax machine. Those opinions are laughable in hindsight. The digital economy accounted for 10% of U.S. GDP in 2022, or $2.6 trillion, and it was growing three times faster than the overall economy.\nI believe AI will be much the same two decades from now. The naysayers will seem woefully out of touch in hindsight, and patient investors that bought good stocks (at reasonable prices) will have been well rewarded. That does not necessarily mean Nvidia is worth buying, but I think Morgan Stanley analysts have the right idea. \"Bottom line, we think the backdrop warrants AI exposure even amid extreme enthusiasm -- and Nvidia remains the clearest way to get that exposure.\"\nFor context, Morgan Stanley has set Nvidia with a split-adjusted price target of $116 per share. The analysts have also outlined a bear-case target of $51 per share and a bull-case target of $136 per share.\nInvestors that never owned (or sold out of) Nvidia prior to 2024 have had a difficult time beating the market. As mentioned, the average S&P 500 stock has underperformed the index by 10.7% year to date, the largest underperformance since 1990.\nOne way investors can avoid a similar problem in the future is by owning an S&P 500 index fund. That strategy will not help investors beat the market, but it will help them match its returns. Personally, I keep a relatively large portion of my portfolio in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, and I keep the remainder in individual stocks. In doing so, my portfolio will beat the market if my stocks outperform, but it won't lag the market too much if my stocks underperform.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett and tech stocks go together like...well, they usually don't go together. The legendary investor typically avoids stocks that are out of his wheelhouse. And tech isn't his strong suit.\nUnsurprisingly, Buffett doesn't own a single share of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). So, has he missed out on the artificial intelligence (AI) stock's massive gains over the last few years? Not entirely.\nAlthough Buffett doesn't own any shares of Nvidia, Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio includes two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that do. As a result, he has directly profited as Nvidia stock has skyrocketed.\nNvidia was added to the S&P 500 in 2001, replacing the beleaguered energy company Enron.\u00a0In the fourth quarter of 2019, Berkshire initiated positions in two S&P 500 index ETFs -- the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO). The conglomerate hasn't sold shares of either ETF since then.\nGranted, Buffett hasn't directly profited very much from Nvidia's gains via Berkshire's stakes in these two S&P 500 index ETFs. For one thing, Berkshire owns only small positions in the funds -- 39,400 shares of the SPDR ETF and 43,000 shares of the Vanguard ETF. These holdings comprise less than 0.1% of Berkshire's total portfolio. For several years, Berkshire's wholly owned subsidiary, New England Asset Management (NEAM), has also owned positions too small to move the needle much in both ETFs.\nAdditionally, Nvidia makes up only 7.25% of the S&P 500, which is weighted based on market cap. When Berkshire first bought the two S&P 500 ETFs in late 2019, the AI stock had a much smaller weight than it does now.\nBuffett has indirectly profited from Nvidia's remarkable rise, too. Exactly how he's done so requires some deductive analysis.\nLet's start with the fact that the stocks of the leading cloud services providers have performed exceptionally well recently. Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), whose Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top cloud service platform, skyrocketed 81% last year and more than 20% year to date. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock jumped 57% in 2023 and is up almost 20% this year. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), which operates Google Cloud, has seen its shares soar 58% last year and more than 25% so far in 2024.\nThere's no question that the AI boom, especially with the surging adoption of generative AI, has been a key factor in the performance of all three cloud stocks. Importantly, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are major customers of Nvidia. The three companies almost certainly wouldn't have been able to handle the increased demand for cloud services with Nvidia's AI chips.\nI think it's fair to say, therefore, that Nvidia is partly responsible for the share price gains experienced by Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. However, how much of those gains can be attributed to Nvidia is hard to determine.\nSo, how does this tie in with Buffett? First, Berkshire owns 10 million shares of Amazon. Second, NEAM (Berkshire's subsidiary) owns positions in Alphabet and Microsoft. Third, all three cloud stocks are also key holdings of Berkshire's two S&P 500 index ETFs.\nIt's possible (and perhaps even probable) that you're in the same position as Buffett -- profiting from Nvidia without owning the stock. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is the largest ETF based on assets under management, while the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ranks third. Even if you don't own either ETF, your investment portfolio could include one or more other ETFs or mutual funds with positions in Nvidia.\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are also widely owned stocks. You could either directly own some or all of them or own funds with stakes in the megacap stocks.\nTo be sure, these ways of making money from Nvidia aren't nearly as rewarding as owning shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker. But it could at least provide some consolation for investors who have kicked themselves for not buying Nvidia sooner. It also underscores one of the advantages of investing in S&P 500 index ETFs: Big winners like Nvidia garner increasingly higher weights in the index as their market caps grow -- and can make you more money in the process.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) trade took a turn for the worse on Monday as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares dropped as much as 6.5%, dragging the entire AI market with it.\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) fell as much as 8.5%, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) was down 3.8% at its low today. The three AI stocks were down 4.9%, 7%, and 3.2%, respectively, at 11:30 a.m. ET. There isn't any specific news about AI, but investors have a lot on their minds about the future demand for the chips driving AI today.\nOn Friday, Nvidia insiders, including CEO Jensen Huang, announced massive stock sales beyond just tax sales related to stock options and warrants. Huang reported he sold 240,000 shares on the open market on Thursday and Friday, totaling $31.6 million for just those two days.\nIn June alone, Huang has already sold nearly $95 million of stock as he's been touting the growth potential for AI long term. Numerous other executives have also reported large stock sales on the open market.\nInsider sales can be an indication they are less bullish on a stock, which is why this is notable.\nAs impressive as AI demand has been, the valuations of Nvidia and Super Micro Computer in particular have hit crazy levels. You can see below that Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is still over 70 and its price-to-sales (P/S) multiple is 37.6. Super Micro Computer isn't quite as expensive, but it's still priced for perfection.\nInvestors must consider how much growth is priced into AI stocks right now and what the likelihood is that they will live up to that potential. Very few AI companies make money, so the money flowing to chips could slow down if those that are developing AI models and tools don't create business plans that make them sustainable in the long term.\nInvestors are suddenly thinking about demand because we're only a few weeks away from the start of earnings season for the second quarter of 2024. That's when we'll hear about end demand and margins for tech companies building AI products, including those buying the most Nvidia chips.\nIf demand is strong, stocks could go up, but investors are taking money off the table for fear there could be some disappointing signs. And with stocks priced to perfection, even the smallest crack in the AI growth story could send them tumbling.\nNvidia is the biggest name in AI, and its fortunes will drive Super Micro Computer and TSMC, which are suppliers to the company and beneficiaries from the overall growth in AI demand. If the market for Nvidia chips continues to grow, the other companies will have plenty of demand.\nWhat I think the focus over the next month will be is the demand for AI products that companies have introduced and whether or not that will lead to more capital spending. If not, there could be a pullback in orders in the future, and that could put both revenue and margin projections into question.\nThese high valuations and lack of AI business models are why I'm avoiding AI stocks today. The risk is simply too high for the observable reward right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Nvidia\u2019s endorsement is needed before either can directly compete with SK Hynix Inc., whose share price has soared since it began supplying Nvidia with HBM3 and more advanced HBM3e chips.\nSamsung has fallen well behind its smaller rival in that market, which has experienced explosive growth because the chips are used for training artificial intelligence models like ChatGPT. While Samsung hasn\u2019t failed any qualification tests, its HBM product needed more engineering work, Huang told reporters.\n\u201cWe just have to do the engineering. It\u2019s just not done,\u201d Huang said during a briefing at Computex in Taipei. \u201cI want it to be done by yesterday. But it\u2019s not done yet. We have to be patient.\u201d\nSamsung\u2019s shares climbed as much as 4.1% in after-hours trading in Seoul, according to local financial data provider Koscom. Huang\u2019s comments came after Reuters reported that Samsung was grappling with heat and power consumption issues in its HBMs, which are designed to work in tandem with Nvidia\u2019s AI accelerators.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no story there,\u201d Huang said when asked directly about that article.\nInvestors have become increasingly concerned about Samsung\u2019s response to SK Hynix, which recently reported its fastest pace of revenue growth since at least 2010. The growing rift is considered one of the key factors behind Samsung\u2019s recent decision to replace the head of its semiconductor division \u2014 an unusual step that signaled to investors the company\u2019s resolve to make up lost ground.\nIn contrast, SK Hynix\u2019s production capacity for such chips is almost fully booked through next year. Given the capacity constraints, Nvidia could benefit from having a strong alternative supplier.\nSamsung \u2014 the world\u2019s largest producer of memory chips overall \u2014 says it has already begun mass production of its latest HBM product, eight-layer HBM3E, and plans to mass produce 12-layer versions in the second quarter. The company expects its supply of HBM to increase by at least three times in 2024 compared with last year.\nBut SK Hynix is also expanding.

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of the\u00a0Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nThe second half of 2024 is here and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve remain elusive, with warnings about valuations and AI-led market hype growing louder. A number of notable Wall Street analysts have recently warned that the markets remains more concentrated than ever where just a few stocks account for most of the gains, thanks to their dominance in the AI industry. Many also believe the market is up for a correction as it has entered the overbought territory. Financial services company BTIG recently said in a report that the world\u2019s fifth-largest exchange-traded fund by assets under management (AUM), QQQ Trust Series 1, now trades \u201cwell into\u201d overbought territory based on its Relative Strength Index technical indicator.\u00a0 QQQ tracks \u00a0the Nasdaq-100 Index and it\u2019s not surprising to see the ETF showing signs of being overbought as more and more investors pile into mega-cap tech stocks in order to ride the AI bandwagon.\nFor this article we scanned the holdings of the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF and picked top technology holdings of the fund with higher Relative Strength Index (RSI) values. Usually, an RSI value of 60 and above shows a stock is overbought. We have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors with these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0shares have an RSI of over 70, indicating the stock is overbought. It\u2019s the second-biggest holding of the QQQ ETF, which has entered the overbought territory according to BTIG.\nHowever, many believe NVDA has more upside potential.\nUBS believes Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to benefit from the $331 billion market opportunity in the AI Enabling layer, thanks to its GPUs. In the Cloud segment of the Enabling layer, UBS thinks Nvidia Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) DGX offering makes the company a promising player. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) DGX Cloud is a supercomputing service that gives enterprises access to software and infrastructure required to train advanced models for generative AI. It\u2019s a combination of servers and workstations for optimizing deep learning applications through the use of general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU).\nOn the Intelligence and Application layer of the AI value chain, UBS sees no notable catalyst for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nNVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest product announcements and its plans revealed at the Computex 2024 show that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts like NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and think its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA): NVDA shares were our top contributor in the quarter following blowout 4Q results and 1Q guidance driven by strong data center sales. The company reported quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion, up 265% year-over-year, and EPS in the quarter of $5.16, up 487% year-over-year and 12% ahead of expectations. Revenue guidance for 1Q of $24 billion was 8% above very high expectations. The artificial intelligence arms race kicked-off by ChatGPT and Alphabet\u2019s Bard, among others, has generated tremendous demand for Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphic processors.\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": " Alexandra Canal    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NVDA) stock went on a wild ride this week as shares reversed direction from all-time highs and Wall Street continued to debate how much more the chip giant can add to its record-setting rally.\n\"The stock's steep climb makes it vulnerable to profit taking, but we argue any volatility [is] likely to be short-lived,\" Bank of America wrote on Thursday. The bank reiterated its Buy rating and $150 price target, calling Nvidia a \"top pick.\"\nThe chipmaker, which briefly dethroned Microsoft (MSFT) as the world's most valuable company on Tuesday, saw its market cap edge lower on Friday to sit at around $3.12 trillion, below Microsoft's $3.33 trillion.\nPatrick Moorhead, Moor Insights & Strategy founder and CEO, told Yahoo Finance on Friday that investors should be watchful for signs of a pullback.\nWhile he said he doesn't see the status quo of Nvidia's dominance changing over the next six to nine months, investors should focus on \"the downstream profitability that people in the ecosystem are making or not making.\"\n\"These are the software companies like Adobe, Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow. Because if those enterprises and those consumers aren't paying more for these new AI features, then this whole gravy train comes to a screeching halt, like we saw in the internet bust,\" he explained.\nIncreased competition could also serve as a headwind to pricing power, Moorhead warned, as Nvidia competes with not only \"merchant silicon providers\" like AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) but also \"homegrown ones\" from Amazon's AWS (AMZN), Microsoft's Azure (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\nThe flurry of AI investment has continued to boost optimism over Nvidia's growth rate. In its latest quarterly report, the company reported adjusted earnings that surged 461% year over year while revenue grew by 262%.\nIn addition to stellar earnings, Nvidia also completed a 10-for-1 split on June 10 and doubled its quarterly cash dividend \u2014 a move that's been echoed by other tech giants in recent quarters.\nShares of Nvidia are up about 200% over the last 12 months and more than 3,200% over the last five years. Year to date, Nvidia has gained around 160%.\nBut despite its sky-high valuation, the case for $4 trillion has been building.\n\"I don't see any reason it couldn't get up to $4 trillion,\" Moorhead said. \"A lot of this is based on expectations because you look at the price-to-earnings ratio, it's pretty astronomical. And if we can see some positive signs from the downstream players ... [I] don't see any reason why this couldn't get to $4 trillion.\"\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives agreed, writing in a note to clients on Thursday, \"We believe over the next year the race to $4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and center between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.\"\nIves said the AI revolution is a party that is \"just getting started,\" driven by the pace of data center spending by tech giants. He expects incremental AI spend to hit $1 trillion over the next decade with over 70% of enterprises ultimately heading down the AI use case path.\n\"Its 9pm in a party going till 4am with the rest of the tech world now joining,\" he said.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock (Hint: It's Not Its Stock Split)",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The hottest stock on Wall Street, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), is enacting a stock split on June 7. The following trading day, June 10, Nvidia's stock price will be reduced by one-tenth, causing the number of shares to increase tenfold. After that date, the stock will be trading for around $100 rather than $1,000.\nAlthough stock splits excite investors, there are far better reasons to buy Nvidia's stock than just the stock split. I've come up with three good reasons, but many more could have been included.\nNvidia's incredible performance since the start of 2023 (the stock is up around 650%) has been directly tied to the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Nvidia's primary products are graphics processing units (GPUs), which are incredibly useful in processing AI models because they can compute in parallel. Because Nvidia's GPUs are best in class, they quickly became the top pick for anyone looking to increase their AI computing power dramatically.\nThis directly translated into jaw-dropping revenue growth for a company of Nvidia's size. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 (ending April 28), Nvidia's revenue rose 262% year over year. While that's a mind-blowing figure, this will likely be the last quarter with a growth rate that high. Now, Nvidia is starting to come up against stronger year-over-year comparisons, so this growth rate will likely decelerate.\nInstead, investors can also look at the quarter-over-quarter growth rate. For Q1, this figure was 18%, which is still a blazing-fast growth rate. In Q2, management expects revenue of $28 billion, indicating about 8% quarter-over-quarter growth. While that's a slight slowdown, management may be sandbagging its guidance. In the fourth quarter of FY 2024, it guided for $24 billion in Q1 revenue, indicating a 9% quarterly growth rate. And it beat that projection handily.\nThe consequences of missing guidance far outweigh those of exceeding projections, so management has nothing to gain by issuing less aggressive guidance. Investors should keep this in mind, as there are almost no signs of Nvidia's growth slowing down.\nNvidia's H100 is the industry standard in data center GPUs. While this remains a top pick, Nvidia's H200 is the latest and greatest technology.\nCompared to the H100 GPU, it runs large language models at up to two times the speed of the H100. Furthermore, the H200 is also more efficient and uses about half of the energy as the H100 when running a similar AI model.\nEnergy input costs are a massive operating expense for data centers, and upgrading to H200s may offer potential cost savings for many of the largest players in the space.\nAlthough its H100 GPU is already industry-leading, Nvidia's H200 looks to be an upgrade in nearly all aspects. This could lead to an upgrade cycle, which will keep the demand for Nvidia's GPUs thriving for years to come.\nNvidia also plans to launch its new Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever later this year -- yet another tailwind for Nvidia stock.\nThanks to Nvidia's incredible rise, its stock has become quite expensive due to the lofty expectations built into it. That's why using the traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio isn't as useful when assessing Nvidia's stock. The stock market is a forward-looking machine, so investors should use a metric that measures forward earnings, like the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\nAt 41 times forward earnings, Nvidia isn't a cheap stock by any stretch of the imagination.\nHowever, when you compare it to other big tech companies, it doesn't look so bad. Although Nvidia is more expensive, it's still priced in a range similar to Amazon (39 times forward earnings) and Microsoft (35 times forward earnings).\nBoth of these are great companies, but Nvidia's upside far exceeds that of the other two. So, if you're looking for a stock with a higher ceiling than Amazon and Microsoft, Nvidia is a great pick.\nWhile many investors are excited about the stock split because it will make the stock more accessible to investors without access to fractional shares and options traders, these are far better reasons to own the stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "How to Play the Incoming Nvidia 10-for-1 Stock Split",
        "Author": "  Rocky White ",
        "Text": "The most dominant stock in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, Nvidia\u00a0(NVDA), is about to become more affordable. At the end of the week, NVDA will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split. Therefore, instead of having to shell out over $1,000 to own a share, you\u2019ll be able to buy a share for close to $100.\nTheoretically, a stock split has no effect on the value of a company because its lower price is offset by an increase in shares. But it will make the stock \u2013 not to mention its options \u2013 more affordable for smaller accounts. So, should you add NVDA to your portfolio? This week, I\u2019m looking at how stocks performed in the past after prices dropped following a stock split.\nLooking at current optionable stocks and going back to 2010, I have data on about 240 splits. The table below summarizes how stocks performed following those splits. The second table is for comparison, and shows what returns would have looked like if instead of buying stocks, you bought the broad-market S&P 500 Index (SPX).\nBased on those numbers, I would say stock splits are not a reason to buy. Stocks that split performed similarly to the SPX. In the two weeks immediately following a split, the stocks averaged a gain of 0.44%, with just under half beating the index. The six-month average return slightly outperforms the SPX (6.6% to 5.4%), with again just under half beating the index. Investing in the general market, however, yields a lot less volatility.\nNvidia shares rose considerably in price over the last two years, and now sit at over $1,000 per share. The tables below look at splits where the stock was above $400 before the split.\nThe returns following these 19 stock splits show slight underperformance. Looking at three months after the split, the stock is essentially at breakeven, while the SPX showed a return of 2.11%. Meanwhile, six months after the splits, stocks averaged a 2.3% gain vs. 3.47% for the index, while only 44% of the returns beat the index over the next six months.\nNvidia is one of just a handful of companies that have a market cap above $2 trillion. To put this into perspective, there have only been14 splits where the company had a market cap above $100 billion.\nHuge companies significantly underperformed following stock splits. In the short term, the stocks averaged a loss of more than 2% over the next two weeks, with not even 30% beating the SPX. The six-month returns also underperformed, averaging a slight loss of 0.3%, with just 38.5% of the returns beating the SPX.\nFinally, let\u2019s take a look at expensive stocks with huge market caps that split. As you would expect after looking at the figures above, these stocks tended to underperform the broader market. They averaged a loss of 2.66% over the first two weeks, and then rose from there to get just above breakeven after six months.\nThis means that buying the stocks that split yielded a 0.5% return over the next six months, with 37.5% being positive, and the same amount beating the SPX. If instead you just bought the SPX, the average return was 3.8%, with six of eight being positive.\nAs a bonus, here is a list of those eight companies that were trading above $400 with a market cap above $100 billion at the time of their splits. The analysis above isn't looking good for NVDA, but on the bright side, the security has been here before. NVDA met the criteria at its last stock split in mid-2021, and went on to gain almost 40% over the next six months. It's now up over 500% since that split.\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- The year was 1999. Steve Jobs had recently returned to lead Apple. Intel was the dominant force in semiconductors. And a little-known chipmaker named Nvidia made its debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNvidia Sales Grow So Fast That Wall Street Can\u2019t Keep Up\nHow Long Can High Rates Last? Bond Markets Say Maybe Forever\nRussia Is Storing Up a Crime Wave When Its War on Ukraine Ends\nCDK Hackers Want Millions in Ransom to End Car Dealership Outage\nYen Is Under Pressure Even as Japan Steps Up Its Verbal Warnings\nIt took less than three years for Nvidia Corp. to ascend into the S&P 500 \u2014 replacing the disgraced oil-trading conglomerate Enron, no less.\nBut even then, few people would have bet that the company would go on to become the best performing stock of the last quarter-century, posting a total return of 591,078% since its initial public offering, including reinvested dividends. It\u2019s a difficult number to comprehend and a testament, in part, to the financial mania brewing around artificial intelligence and how investors have come to see Nvidia \u2014 which makes the cutting-edge chips powering the technology \u2014 as the single-biggest winner of the boom.\nOn Tuesday, that run culminated in Nvidia unseating Microsoft Corp. as the world\u2019s most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion. More than $2 trillion of that value has been added this year.\nThe company\u2019s rise was by no means assured \u2014 and neither is its staying power at the top of the S&P 500. Long-time investors in Nvidia have had to stomach three annual collapses of 50% or more in the stock. Sustaining the current rally will require customers to keep spending billions of dollars a quarter on AI equipment, whose returns on investment are so far relatively small.\nWhat ultimately paved the way for Nvidia to climb to the top, though, was the company\u2019s big bet on graphics chips and the vision of co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang that the industry would shift to what he calls \u201caccelerated computing,\u201d something his chips are inherently better at than the competition.\n\u201cYou have to give the management team, I think, an enormous amount of credit,\u201d said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. \u201cThey have caught each wave of innovation in hardware perfectly well.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a look at Nvidia from its IPO to now.\nEarly Years\nNvidia got off to a hot start.\nBetween its debut and the time it entered the S&P 500, the stock gained more than 1,600%, giving it a market value of about $8 billion. That rise came as many other technology stocks were cratering in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, which peaked in March 2000.\nThe company\u2019s key to early success: getting its technology in video-game consoles like Microsoft\u2019s Xbox and Sony\u2019s PlayStation. Nvidia\u2019s GeForce graphics processing units, or GPUs, became objects of desire among gamers because they consistently offered the most realistic experience.\n\u201cJensen was always a great communicator, told a good story, and clearly GPUs were becoming more important,\u201d said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management, who was a buyer in the IPO. \u201cEach successive generation of hardware gave a lot better performance, a lot more realistic picture and then PC gaming really came into being.\u201d\nLitigation and Competition\nThe next six years weren\u2019t kind to Nvidia. The stock plunged in 2008 as the financial crisis weakened demand and long-struggling rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. started turning things around.\nMeanwhile, an agreement between Nvidia and Intel that allowed the companies to use each other\u2019s capabilities went sour, forcing Nvidia out of one of its biggest markets. The two settled in 2011, with Intel agreeing to pay Nvidia $1.5 billion.\nThe following year, Nvidia unveiled graphics chips for servers inside data centers. They could help sophisticated computing work such as oil and gas exploration and weather prediction, giving Nvidia a foothold in what would become a lucrative market. However, those chips did not immediately fly off the shelf. It would take nearly nine years for Nvidia shares to surpass their 2007 high.\nCrypto and Covid\nNvidia shares took off again in 2015. During that period, the company\u2019s chips were becoming the foundation of emerging technologies, from advanced graphics interfaces to autonomous vehicles to a new wave of AI products.\nThat\u2019s when Shana Sissel, chief executive officer at Banrion Capital Management, first really took note of the company. She described a 2017 conference where Nvidia was more like a pageant winner than an investment idea.\n\u201cEvery single speaker talked about Nvidia being the most important company,\u201d Sissel said. \u201cAt that point, it was really on my radar screen.\u201d\nEven after demand from cryptocurrency miners dried up, data-center sales continued to grow. The Covid-19 pandemic boosted that business, as companies needed to purchase additional computing power to support remote work. Nvidia\u2019s data-center revenue rose by a multiple of eight from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2021.\nAI Sales Explode\nNvidia\u2019s shares slumped in 2022 along with the rest of the technology sector, which was reeling from soaring interest rates and falling demand after the Covid-era boom.\nOpenAI\u2019s release of ChatGPT in late-2022 made an instant splash but it took time for investors to realize how Nvidia might benefit. Eventually, interest in ChatGPT and other generative AI products exploded, triggering a frantic surge in orders for Nvidia\u2019s chips.\nWhen the company reported first-quarter 2023 earnings, the scale of the jump in its business shocked nearly everyone on Wall Street. Nvidia gave a forecast for quarterly sales that was more than 50% above the average projection.\nNvidia\u2019s data-center sales eclipsed its gaming revenue for the first time in fiscal 2023. In Nvidia\u2019s current fiscal year, analysts expect those sales to top $100 billion.\n\u201cThey have a very defensible place in the industry,\u201d said Williams, the strategist at Wayve Capital Management. \u201cThey\u2019re not gonna be 95% of market share forever, obviously, but it would be almost impossible for anybody to replace them.\u201d\nRead this next: Chip Tech Spending Gets $81 Billion Boost in China Rivalry\n--With assistance from Ian King.\n(Adds this year\u2019s increase in market cap in fourth paragraph.

        "Title": "Why Is Everyone Talking About Nvidia's Stock Split?",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock split may be one of the most talked-about subjects on the planet right now. At least when it comes to financial news. The artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant announced the operation during its earnings report last month and completed it on June 7. And today Nvidia shares start trading at their split-adjusted price.\nThis operation was eagerly anticipated, with investors wondering about a possible split over the past year as Nvidia stock roared higher. When the company finally spoke of its plans, Nvidia stock, trading at around $950, raced past $1,000. So, it's clear there's a lot of excitement surrounding this move by Nvidia -- even though stock splits aren't known to boost stock performance. So why is everyone talking about Nvidia's stock split? Let's find out.\nFirst, a quick note about stock splits in general. These operations involve the issuance of additional shares to current holders, but they don't change the market value of the company or the value of an investor's holding. They just lower the price of each individual share.\nThe ratio of the split determines the price, and in the case of Nvidia, we're looking at a 10-for-1 split. So, if you owned one share of the company last week, you now own a total of 10 shares at the post-split price. Considering the price of Nvidia's stock last week, the new price should be around $122 per share.\nSince, as I mentioned above, stock splits are purely mechanical moves and don't change anything about the fundamentals of a company, they don't act as catalysts for share price performance. But there still are two reasons to be excited about Nvidia's move -- and they are the reasons this Nvidia stock split is in the spotlight right now.\nFirst, this move, by lowering the price of each individual share, opens the stock up to a broader range of investors. Nvidia even said that its motive for launching the split was to make it easier for employees and investors to buy the stock.\nThe level of $1,000 a share may represent a psychological barrier for some investors -- and even if the stock is cheap from a valuation standpoint, they may hesitate to buy. In other cases, an investor may use a brokerage that doesn't offer fractional shares, and the price of $900 or $1,000 for one share might be beyond that investor's budget.\nBut these problems disappear with the launch of a stock split, bringing the price of each share down to a level more people can access. This is positive for the company and for investors who want to open a small position in Nvidia.\nThe second reason investors are cheering about Nvidia's split is it's a sign of confidence from the company about its future. A company that makes a good candidate for a stock split usually has done well in the past. The company's shares have climbed to a high level and generally there's a good reason for that, such as earnings growth.\nIf this particular player actually decides to split its stock, it shows the company believes more growth lies ahead. Nvidia likely has confidence its stock can go on to advance to high levels again, and importantly, demand for the company's AI products and services supports this idea. Nvidia has reported quarter after quarter of triple-digit revenue gains, with revenue reaching record levels. In the most recent quarter, revenue soared to $26 billion. Nvidia says demand for its chips and platforms exceeds supply, and it expects this to continue even as the company says it's constantly \"racing\" to serve these multiplying orders.\nAll this means there's reason to join Nvidia in its confidence about earnings growth -- and potentially share performance -- moving forward.\nSo, yes, a stock split in itself is just a mechanical move. But this decision still is a positive signal for Nvidia and for shareholders, and that's why everyone is talking about it.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks out there for the past couple of years (up 582% since June 2021), but there are reasons to believe that it still has plenty of upside ahead.\nLet's look at six reasons why now might be a good time to buy Nvidia stock like there's no tomorrow.\nDemand for Nvidia's graphic processing units (GPUs) is booming as companies clamor to get supplies of its chips for artificial intelligence (AI) model training and inference used in data centers. This has led to incredible growth in its data center segment, with fiscal 2025 first-quarter revenue surging 427% year over year to $22.6 billion.\nThe company credits its growth to its Hopper GPU computing platform, which includes its H100 and H200 chips. According to Nvidia, demand for its H200 chip along with its just-introduced Blackwell architecture far exceeds demand and this could continue to be the case well into 2025.\nAt this point, the only thing keeping Nvidia from selling even more GPUs appears to be supply constraints as its semiconductor manufacturing partners look to increase production capacity to keep up with the demand.\nNvidia isn't the only GPU maker, but its chips have become the industry standard due to its CUDA software platform. The company created the free software platform in 2006 to allow programmers to directly program its chips. As a result, programmers learned to program GPUs using the CUDA platform.\nThis has created a huge moat for Nvidia since most GPU programmers are knowledgeable about the CUDA platform and how to use it. Retraining programmers on other software platforms would be timely and thus costly. Programmers having to know various software platforms would also likely make them less efficient.\nBy pairing its GPUs with CUDA, Nvidia has been able to control the entire tech stack, from the GPUs to the software to the firmware updates. Meanwhile, as it advances its technology, it makes it backward compatible, so its newer tech can work with its older tech.\nAltogether, this moat has helped the company take about an 80% market share in the GPU market.\nAnother important part of the Nvidia story is its continued innovation in the GPU space. The company accelerated its development cycle to one year from two years, pushing out advancements. This should not only keep demand strong but also keep prices high as it continues to drive innovation.\nThe company's Hopper architecture drives huge demand, but it has already introduced its new Blackwell architecture to drive additional sales in the back half of this year and in 2025. Meanwhile, the company's new Rubin architecture is already slated to be released in 2026.\nNvidia's architecture will be backward compatible with its older technology, but this accelerated innovation schedule should be a huge driver as customers try not to fall behind each other.\nWhile it seems like everyone has been talking about AI forever, it really only hit the mainstream after OpenAI launched ChatGP in November of 2022. Soon afterward, Microsoft meaningfully increased its investment in the start-up and began incorporating AI into its products. Since then, the AI race has been on, with numerous big tech companies looking to get in on this next big technological advancement.\nThat said, we are still very much in the early innings of generative AI. The technology is still relatively new, and many companies in various industries are still in the process of laying out their own AI roadmaps and how they could improve their businesses.\nThis is good news for a company like Nvidia. AI could be much bigger in several years and there is going to be a lot more GPUs needed to help power the AI revolution.\nOne area of AI that could be the next big opportunity for Nvidia is the automotive sector. Vehicles today are basically computers on wheels, and AI will play a big role when its comes to self-driving vehicles.\nTesla uses Nvidia chips to train its neural networks for its self-driving and autopilot features. The company is currently using a unit comprised of 10,000 H100 GPUs from Nvidia, valued at about $300 million, to support the training of its self-driving technology.\nNvidia has also developed other technology, especially for the auto sector, such as Nvidia Drive Thor, which is a centralized car computer for \"generative AI applications and immersive in-vehicle experiences.\" While the data center is the company's largest market, the automobile market also holds a lot of promise.\nDespite Nvidia's huge stock price gains over the past several years, the stock is relatively inexpensive, trading at about 45 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). That is well below the valuation where the stock traded at a few years ago, and inexpensive given its proven growth. With all the opportunities still in front of the company, its valuation is yet another reason investors should consider buying the stock like there is no tomorrow.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "South China Morning Post ",
        "Text": "A Huawei Technologies executive said the company's latest artificial intelligence (AI) chip is on par with, if not better than Nvidia's A100 - one of the most popular graphics processing units (GPUs) used in the AI industry - in a rare boast by the Chinese tech giant that underscores how quickly it is growing in a market dominated by its US rival.\nHuawei's Ascend 910B AI chip has been found in some tests to deliver 80 per cent of the efficiency of an Nvidia A100 when training large language models, but \"in some other tests, Ascend chips can beat the A100 by 20 per cent\", said Wang Tao, chief operating officer of Huawei Ascend and Kunpeng ecosystem, on the sidelines of the Nanjing World Semiconductor Conference on Thursday.\nThere is \"not much difference\" between the computing power performances of the Huawei 910B and Nvidia A100 in large AI model training, Wang added.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nHis comments come as Huawei assumes an increasingly important role in China's self-sufficiency drive, as Nvidia is unable to ship to the country its advanced GPUs under strict US export restrictions.\nHuawei first introduced the Ascend chip series in 2019, four months after the company was added to a US trade blacklist. Since then, its AI strategy has focused on building an ecosystem of proprietary software and hardware designed to serve domestic clients that have lost access to equivalent technology overseas.\nZhang Dixuan, head of Huawei's Ascend computing business, revealed last month that the Ascend ecosystem had 40 hardware partners, 1,600 software partners and 2,900 AI application solutions.\nDespite its ambitions, Huawei has rarely spoken publicly about its efforts to free itself from the shackles of US sanctions aimed at stemming China's technological advancement in semiconductors and AI.\nThe company has closely guarded the source of the advanced mobile chips that power the Mate 60 smartphone series launched last August - its first 5G handsets in more than two years.\nExperts believe the processors were manufactured by US-sanctioned Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China's top foundry, using improved techniques based on existing equipment.\nBut analysts have said it would be challenging for Chinese manufacturers to produce high-performance AI computing chips using older systems because in general, AI chips are much bigger than smartphone chips. For example, Nvidia's A100 is eight times larger than Apple's A13 mobile processor.\nNvidia has designed lower-grade chips tailored for China-based clients to keep serving one of the company's largest markets. In the first half of last year, Nvidia processors made up 90 per cent of the 500,000 AI chips that were sold in China, with Huawei grabbing only 6 per cent of the market.\nBut after Washington in October escalated its export curbs to cover more of Nvidia's chips, CEO Jensen Huang said earlier this year that the firm is facing \"a lot more competition in China\" because of limitations on the technology it can sell there.\nThe main exhibition hall of the World Semiconductor Conference taking place in Nanjing, eastern China.

Photo: Che Pan>\nWhile Huawei's best chips are technologically inferior to the latest GPUs from Nvidia, which just overtook Apple as the world's second-most valuable firm, the Chinese company's Ascend 910B and Kunpeng chips have emerged as top alternatives for domestic companies working in AI.\nAscend chips have proliferated in various industries through so-called AI boxes - all-in-one machines that combine AI chips, industry-specific algorithms and pre-trained large AI models. Chinese tech giants, including Tencent Holdings and Baidu, as well as leading start-ups like iFlyTek, have bought 910B chips, according to Huawei's Wang.\nHuawei operates computer clusters running on Ascend chips in 19 cities across China, including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. It also has plans to bring new clusters online in major provincial capitals, including Kunming in southwestern Yunnan, Changsha in central Hunan, Changchun in northeastern Jilin and Jinan in eastern Shandong.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Instead he dumped the entire stake more than five years ago, when it was worth less than $4 billion, after a perilous drop in the stock threatened his fund\u2019s performance.\n\u201cI had to tearfully sell the shares,\u201d Son told SoftBank shareholders today at the firm\u2019s annual meeting, according to remarks cited by the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe fish that got away was big.\"\nHad he held on, it would be more valuable than his prescient investment in Alibaba, in which his holding company, SoftBank, was at one point the largest shareholder.\nSon is best known for being an early investor in Jack Ma\u2019s Chinese e-commerce platform, when SoftBank poured $20 million into Alibaba in 2000. The value of its stake eventually reached $60 billion when the Amazon rival went public in 2014, the largest IPO in history until that of Saudi Aramco.\nSon parlayed that success into his next endeavor\u2014the creation three years later of SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund. Until then, no one had ever had the audacity to raise $100 billion for a single investment vehicle that would deploy its capital in disruptive technology.\nArmed with this unprecedented firepower, the fund made billion-dollar bets in ride-hailing leader Uber, enterprise software provider Slack, and, less successfully, office-sharing company WeWork.\nOne of those firms it bought into straightaway was Nvidia, which had been minting money at the time, selling graphics cards to crypto miners up until a prolonged \u201changover,\u201d as CEO Jensen Huang described it. The sentiment swing led to a brutal 50% drawdown in value in the space of four months, and Son ended up selling his shares in what would turn out to be a premature decision.\nIn February 2019, SoftBank revealed it had exited its position entirely when it was worth around $3.6 billion. Had Son held on, he would have made far more money for SoftBank and its Vision Fund investors than he ever did with Amazon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to remember the ones that I missed,\u201d Son conceded.\nTo make good, the SoftBank founder is working on a new $100 billion fund for artificial superintelligence (ASI) named after the Shinto god of creation Izanagi. Asked about the plans, Son declined to go into details but promised it would be as grand as the name implied and even suggested it was why he was put on this earth.\nReferring to himself in the third person, he said: \u201cI seriously believe the reason why Masayoshi Son was born is to make ASI come true.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n.\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. Since Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0Israel Englander\u00a0is one of the most notable hedge fund managers in America. He founded Millennium Management back in 1989. Today, the fund\u2019s portfolio is worth over $234 billion. Englander nabbed the top spot in Bloomberg\u2019s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2023, with a whopping $2.8 billion in net earnings including gains from personal investments and fees. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Izzy Englander\u2019s Millennium Management earned $600 million from commodities investments last year. However, in a separate report, the publication said despite installing a new chief of its commodities and making big changes, Millennium\u2019s commodities business is lagging behind Citadel (of billionaire Ken Griffin) which made a whopping $8 billion from commodities in 2022. Bloomberg said, citing sources, that part of the reason why Millennium is struggling to post big gains is billionaire Englander\u2019s imposition of \u201ctight guardrails\u201d to limit losses. \u00a0To make money in the commodities business, experts say, you have to take risks and give some freedom to traders. But Englander likes to be in control. \u00a0A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices. Yet Englander owns 100% of the firm.\nThe report said, citing a person who works at the fund, that this major concentration is \u201cnot a good idea.\u201d\nThe FT report said Englander\u2019s fund was up 8.3% in 2023 through October, while it returned 12.5% in 2022,\u00a0 13.6% in 2021 and an impressive 25.9% in 2020.\nFor this article, we scanned Millennium Management\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund\u2019s top 10 holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management\nBillionaire Israel Englander\u2019s Stake Value:\u00a0$1,213,332,896\nNvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is getting several bullish calls from the Wall Street lately. Bank of America recently added Nvidia Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0shares to its US 1 List. The list includes BofA\u2019s best investment ideas consisting of buy-rated stocks trading in the US. Nvidia Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0latest product announcements and its plans revealed at Computex show that the company has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts believe Nvidia Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will start shipping H200 in the second half of this year. At its GTC conference Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed three accelerators \u2013 B200, GB200 and GB200 NVL72. All of these products provide growth catalysts for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares and justify its P/E multiple of 71, given the company\u2019s growth expectation of over 100% this year and 32% next year. Based on 2026 EPS estimate set by Wall Street, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 35.74, which makes the stock\u2019s valuation attractive given the growth catalysts it has.\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA): NVDA shares were our top contributor in the quarter following blowout 4Q results and 1Q guidance driven by strong data center sales. The company reported quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion, up 265% year-over-year, and EPS in the quarter of $5.16, up 487% year-over-year and 12% ahead of expectations. Revenue guidance for 1Q of $24 billion was 8% above very high expectations. The artificial intelligence arms race kicked-off by ChatGPT and Alphabet\u2019s Bard, among others, has generated tremendous demand for Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphic processors.\nOverall, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list of Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. You can visit Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024 to see other stocks in the list.

        "Author": "  Orianna Rosa Royle ",
        "Text": "Nvidia VP Simona Jankowski has just bid the $3.1 trillion tech giant farewell\u2014and paid homage to her boss and CEO Jensen Huang on her way out.\n\u201cWorking with Jensen has been the experience of a lifetime,\u201d she concluded of her time reporting into the billionaire from humble beginnings. \nAfter nearly seven years of running investor relations and strategic finance at the chipmaker, she gushed on LinkedIn that Huang is \u201cin a class of his own\u201d before sharing the three leadership lessons he taught her: \u201cFirst principles thinking, zero-billion dollar markets, speed-of-light execution and so much more.\u201d\n\u201cHe inspired me to reach to the limits, made me laugh to tears, and taught me the harmony of work and family,\u201d Jankowski added.\nAfter an initial foray into developing graphics processors for computer games, the company invented one of the first AI-friendly GPUs and now it\u2019s dominating the market, selling over 70% of all AI chips.\nLast week, Nvidia briefly topped Microsoft to become the world\u2019s most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion.\nSince Jankowski joined Nvidia in 2017, she boasted that she\u2019s watched its revenue grow tenfold and its earnings and market cap have jumped by more than 20 times.\n\u201cPerhaps even more impressively, the AI compute performance delivered by NVIDIA\u2019s flagship GPU is up over 1,000X, while the size of frontier AI models has grown by over 20,000X,\u201d she added. \u201cLiving through exponentials like these is rare and thrilling, and keeps the learning curve steep and exciting.\u201d\nBut Nvidia\u2019s GPU success was no accident\u2014it clearly demonstrates Huang\u2019s habit of applying first principles thinking (that is, questioning every assumption to get to the basic element of a problem) to find innovative solutions instead of mimicking existing models, and forging a business in a zero-billion dollar market (that is, a nascent but potentially giant market).\nPreviously, CPUs\u2014the most common computer chips, which date back to the 1950s\u2014were great for executing complex calculations one at a time, but they didn\u2019t quite fit the needs of data scientists when deep learning and AI research intensified in the 2010s.\nBut GPUs can perform many simple calculations at once\u2014and as it turned out, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs were a perfect fit for the type of computing systems AI developers needed to build and train large language models.\n\u201cJensen is a visionary and saw the trends of GPU adoption in data centers early on and aligned the company\u2019s strategy to that vision,\u201d a semiconductors senior research analyst, Tristan Gerra, told Fortune.\nOne of its prescient moves included creating CUDA, a high-level programming tool the company built in 2007 to help unlock the full capability of its GPUs in a straightforward way.\nCUDA is now so widely used that it\u2019s difficult for companies building large language models like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT to imagine themselves using other tech.\nAs Huang himself previously pointed out, that\u2019s precisely what it means to operate in a zero-billion-dollar market:\n\u201cAlmost all of our purposes should be to go and do something that hasn\u2019t been done before, that is insanely hard to do, that if you achieve it could make a real contribution,\u201d he told Stripe\u2019s CEO Patrick Collison on stage last month.\n\u201cThat market is probably zero billion dollars in size because it\u2019s never been done before\u2014I\u2019d rather be a market maker than a market taker.\u201d\nJankowski, a Stanford University alum, worked at Goldman Sachs for her entire career before joining Nvidia.\nBut even then, Jankowski revealed that she had been working closely with the chipmaker for quite some time.\n\u201cAs a newly minted equity research analyst at Goldman Sachs in 2001, my first assignment was building the NVDA financial model, and I met Jensen Huang as part of our initiation of coverage,\u201d she explained in her LinkedIn post.\nFollowing the company\u2019s \u201ccool product launches, rapid technology advances, supply chain trips to Taiwan\u201d and \u201cQ&As with Jensen\u201d, she said, helped her make her name as an analyst.\nJankowski worked her way up the ranks, covering the semi-conductor industry within Goldman\u2019s Global Investment Research division for years before being promoted to managing director.\nNow, she\u2019s off to join the world of startups as a chief financial officer\u2014but she\u2019s not yet revealed the venture in question.\nFortune has reached Jankowski for comment.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There are currently only three S&P 500 stocks in the $3 trillion club: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). All three are valued right around $3.3 trillion. With a market cap of just under $2.2 trillion, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) looks like the best candidate to join this exclusive club. The stock would need to rise just over 36% to get there.\nLet's look at three reasons why Alphabet looks poised to be the next stock to join the $3 trillion club.\nAlphabet is the dominant leader in search with Google having an approximate 90% global market share. Search is a huge business that is still growing robustly, with Google search revenue up 14% year over year in the first quarter this year to $46.2 billion. While Microsoft has tried to challenge Google's dominance by adding new artificial intelligence (AI) features to its Bing search engine, so far this has not made a dent in Google's dominance.\nAt the same time, YouTube is also a video content leader with one of the most attractive models in the space. Given its user-generated content, the company doesn't have to pay the large upfront content fees of streaming services, instead sharing revenue with its creators. Despite a lackluster advertising market, YouTube's first-quarter revenue jumped 21% year over year to $8.1 billion. The company is just starting to better monetize its short-form videos, which is competing with the likes of ByteDance's TikTok and has a long runway to keep growing.\nMeanwhile, Google's fastest-growing segment is its cloud service business, which grew its revenue 28% year over year to $9.6 billion in Q1. Google Cloud holds the No. 3 position in market share for cloud services (behind 2. Microsoft's Azure and 1. Amazon Web Services) and the business has been a beneficiary of increased AI spending in the broader economy. As a business with a lot of fixed costs, Google Cloud just became profitable in 2023 and is now set to grow its profitability more quickly than revenue as the segment shows operating leverage.\nWhile Google Cloud has already been a big beneficiary of the increased interest in all things AI, other parts of its business are also benefitting. The company is incorporating its Gemini large language model (LLM) into various products including its Pixel smartphones and Workspace product suite. Gemini for Workspace, for example, will start as a $20-a-month add-on subscription built into Gmail, Docs, and Sheets that will act as an AI assistant that can do such tasks as monitor and track projects, organize information, help write proposals, and generate images and designs.\nWhile the company has scaled back its use of AI search overlays for the time being due to some early flubs, it still represents a future opportunity. Google currently only serves ads for about 20% of its searches where the inclusion of ads is relevant to the search, so new ad forms for AI searches will be a big potential opportunity. The technology still needs to improve, but AI and AI-powered search are still very much in their infancy.\nCompared to the stocks already in the $3 trillion club, Alphabet trades at the lowest valuation by far with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 23. Given its current growth and future prospects, the stock currently looks very undervalued.\nIf Alphabet traded at the same 32.5 forward P/E multiple as Apple, its Class A shares would cost $245 and it would have a market cap of $3 trillion. Notably, Alphabet has been showing stronger revenue growth than Apple. In their most recent quarters, Apple saw its revenue decline 4% year over year, while Alphabet grew revenue 15%. Thus, it looks like it should only be a matter of time before Alphabet stock joins the $3 trillion club.\nOverall, Alphabet is an undervalued stock with dominant market positions and strong growth prospects ahead. The stock looks like a solid buy for long-term investors at current levels.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  David Moadel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In case Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) wasn't already beloved among investors, now the semiconductor giant is enticing income seekers by increasing its quarterly dividend payouts. The distributions still won't be huge on a percentage basis, but Nvidia's cash payouts will be a nice bonus for long-term shareholders.\nNvidia made another important announcement along with the dividend hike which may confuse some investors. There's no need to worry, though, as the upcoming changes won't diminish the incentive to buy and hold Nvidia stock.\nAmid a slew of positive first-quarter fiscal 2025 data points, Nvidia's dividend raise announcement may have gotten lost in the shuffle for some investors. Yet income harvesters shouldn't downplay the significance of Nvidia's upcoming quarterly dividend hike.\nTo recap the announcement, Nvidia will increase its quarterly per-share dividend distribution by 150% from $0.04 to $0.10. There's still time to get in, as Nvidia's shareholders of record on June 11 will be paid on June 28 (though, depending on your broker, it might take a few extra days to see the cash payment show up in your account).\nThat's all simple enough, but there's another, concurrent announcement from Nvidia that might complicate things. Specifically, Nvidia is enacting a 10-for-1 forward stock split. If you're an Nvidia shareholder of record on June 6, you'll receive nine additional Nvidia shares after the market closes on June 7; trading on a split-adjusted basis will begin on June 10.\nSo, for example, the Nvidia share price might be reduced from roughly $1,160 to $116. What's known for certain, though, is that the increased dividend distribution will be $0.01 per share after the split rather than $0.10 per share.\nA penny per share per quarter doesn't sound like much, and the forward annual dividend yield will still be minuscule (0.0034%). Still, at least the quarterly per-share payment will be 150% better than the $0.004 it would have been, post-split, without Nvidia's dividend hike.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA): Cheaper after the Stock Split, Yet Priceless",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "AI prodigy Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0stock has risen colossally from $15 (split-adjusted) when I first wrote about it to almost $121 currently. It surpassed Apple to become the world\u2019s second-highest-valued company. I also predicted that NVDA could go for a stock split, and it just did. The stock continues to surprise with newer highs (+144% YTD) after its spectacular earnings beat. Nonetheless, my thesis remains intact: NVDA is attractive for the long term based on its undeniable AI leadership and exponential AI growth potential.\nOn May 22, Nvidia posted yet another blowout Q1 result, driven by robust continued computing and accelerated generative AI demand momentum.\u00a0Adjusted earnings of $6.12 per share\u00a0handily beat the consensus estimate of $5.60 per share. Also, the figure came in much higher (+461%) than the Fiscal Q1-2024 (ended April 2023) figure of $1.09 per share.\nImpressively, Q1 revenue jumped 262% year-over-year to $26.04 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $24.59 billion. On top of that, its adjusted gross margin expanded 13.8 percentage points to an unbelievably new high at 78.4% from 64.6% a year ago.\nConcurrent with the earnings report, the company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split. While the stock split does not change the valuation or the performance of the company, it does mean that NVDA will now be more available to retail investors, creating short-term momentum in the share price.\nOn top of that, the company hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 150% to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis. NVDA shares started trading on a split-adjusted basis today. Markedly, this is Nvidia\u2019s sixth stock split.\nImportantly, NVDA\u2019s crown-jewel segment, Data Center revenues, soared 427% year-over-year to $22.6 billion. The segment makes up 86% of the firm\u2019s total revenue. As expected, revenues declined in China due to the U.S. export control restrictions. During the earnings call, management affirmed that \u201cbusiness in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past.\u201d\nLooking ahead, the Q2 guidance appears promising, with its revenues expected to hover around $28 billion, ahead of expectations. However, adjusted gross margins are forecast to be around 75.5% versus 77% projected for Q1 three months ago. Nonetheless, it still remains far ahead of chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), with gross profit margins of 50.6% and 41.5%, respectively, in the past year.\nNvidia continues to innovate in the AI\u00a0space, keeping its leadership status quo intact by innovating newer, cutting-edge AI products. NVDA\u2019s latest GPUs & CPUs, backed by both its hardware and software capabilities, remain top-of-the-line in the AI industry.\u00a0As the preferred choice in high-computing data centers worldwide, NVDA commands superior pricing power.\nThe scope and expansion of AI continue to grow manifold, and the demand clearly continues to outpace supply. During the earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated, \u201cBeyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, Sovereign AI, automotive, and health care customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\u201d\nAt the Computex conference held in Taiwan on June 2, Huang unveiled Nvidia\u2019s latest AI architecture, Rubin, which is expected to begin shipping in 2026. This follows the launch of the Blackwell platform less than three months ago in March. Blackwell, designed for high-performance AI and scientific computing, succeeded the Hopper platform, which was optimized for AI inference and training and launched less than a year ago.\nBlackwell is now in full production and expected to ramp up in Q3. Meanwhile, Hopper continues to see strong demand.\nFurther, Huang said that NVDA will launch a new family of chips every year, compared to its initial plan of releasing new models every two years. This accelerated pace of innovation and rapid transition to newer models and chip enhancements has allowed Nvidia to retain a 70% to 95% market share (according to estimates from Mizuho Securities) in the AI chip market.\nHowever, competition in the AI space is heating up. Competitors like AMD (with its Ryzen AI 300) and\u00a0Intel are launching newer AI chips at lower prices. Despite this, Nvidia\u2019s first-mover advantage in AI technology keeps AMD and Intel several quarters behind NVDA.\nHaving overtaken Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) by market cap, many investors are hesitant to purchase NVDA stock amid its remarkable rally and concerns about overvaluation.\nOn the contrary, however, NVDA stock is not expensive. Currently, it\u2019s trading at a forward P/E ratio of 44.7x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is relatively cheaper than the multiples of its peer group. For instance, NVDA\u2019s closest competitor and U.S.-based semiconductor company, AMD, is trading at a forward P/E of 47.8x,\u00a0while Netherlands-based semiconductor stock\u00a0ASML (NASDAQ:ASML)\u00a0is trading at a forward P/E of 51x.\nInterestingly, its current valuation is still hovering around its five-year average of 46.6x despite the earnings, margins, and stock price having grown multifold. These are attractive price levels and likely present a reasonable buying opportunity, in my view, given the supernormal growth potential for the AI market titan Nvidia.\nNVDA stands as an invincible force, a stock that garners widespread attention. With 37 Buys and three Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus rating is unmistakably a Strong Buy. Nonetheless, the\u00a0average Nvidia stock target price of $123.62\u00a0suggests that the shares will return 2.2% over the next year.\nNvidia has climbed to become the second most valuable stock in the world, with a market cap of $2.98 trillion, a significant leap from just under $100 billion less than five years ago. NVDA has earned its stature by leading the AI industry to unprecedented heights.\nDespite increasing competition, NVDA continues to enjoy a\u00a0sizeable market share in the AI industry, which will continue to grow by leaps and bounds in the coming years.\u00a0Therefore, I will continue to buy NVDA at current levels. While some critics warn of waning demand after the initial wave of AI installations, I believe this is at least several quarters away. Therefore, I will continue to buy NVDA at current levels.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "Is Nvidia Stock Still a Buy After Its 10-for-1 Stock Split?",
        "Author": "  George Budwell, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the heart and soul of the U.S. stock market for nearly a decade, with the artificial intelligence (AI) gold rush propelling the graphics processing unit (GPU) specialist to a staggering 27,500% gain over this period. However, Nvidia's meteoric rise has recently fueled skepticism from bears, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble of 1995 to 2000.\nSpeaking to this point, Morningstar strategist Brian Colello believes Nvidia's stock is fairly valued at $105 per share after its 10-for-1 stock split went into effect on June 10. Nonetheless, the GPU-titan's shares have already jumped to $136 a little over a week post-split, putting it in overvalued territory, according to Colello.\nIs Nvidia's stock really overvalued? Let's dig deeper to find out.\nFrom a fundamental perspective, Nvidia's stock appears to be in bubble territory. The company's shares trade at 52 times forward earnings, significantly higher than the S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.\nMoreover, Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.55 and price-to-sales ratio of over 42 are well above the averages for technology stocks and the semiconductor industry, respectively. These traditional valuation metrics paint a picture of an extremely overvalued stock.\nHowever, a fundamental analysis may not be the most appropriate approach in this case. Generative AI holds the potential to fundamentally reshape the global economy. AI is poised to radically enhance worker productivity and create entirely new markets, possibly unlocking trillions of dollars in value across all sectors of the global economy.\nThe economic potential of AI is astounding. McKinsey & Co. estimates that generative AI could unlock up to $17.7 trillion in economic value, while Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang believes the global AI economy is on pace to eventually top $100 trillion.\nTo put this into perspective, Nvidia's current market cap stands at $3.35 trillion, which may seem astronomical at first glance but is a drop in the bucket when compared to where the global economy is headed in the age of AI.\nSome analysts have argued that rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel may enjoy a windfall from AI-centric companies diversifying their hardware-sourcing requirements in the years ahead, but the reality is far more complex. Nvidia's GPUs and complementary CUDA platform are simply too far ahead of the competition, especially with a full-on arms race occurring in AI.\nCore AI developers don't have the luxury of switching to a competing platform at this critical juncture, despite the risks associated with overreliance on a single chip designer. In other words, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel might be able to carve out a rather profitable niche in AI-capable chips but aren't going to significantly erode Nvidia's market share among the most important developers driving the bus, so to speak.\nWhile Nvidia's stock may appear expensive and overvalued based on traditional metrics, it's essential to consider the company's central position in the AI revolution. With automation and an abundance of intelligence on track to redraw the global economy within a few short years, Nvidia's bull run is likely just getting started.\nAs such, the fearmongering over another dot-com-type bubble seems wholly unwarranted. It also grossly underestimates the transformative potential of this technology that many think will be the most important invention in the history of humanity.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Investors seem to love artificial intelligence (AI) stocks these days, and one of the most adept companies at capitalizing on this trend is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The role that Nvidia's AI chips play in making the technology a reality justifies this excitement to a significant extent.\nThe problem with investing in Nvidia at this point though is its monstrous size and elevated valuation. At a 39 price-to-sales (P/S) ratio and a $3.1 trillion market cap, one would be right to wonder whether Nvidia can maintain its growth pace.\nFortunately, investors have alternatives as there are other AI stocks available at lower prices and market caps. A quick search should lead investors to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and UiPath (NYSE: PATH). Let's take a closer look at these two AI stock alternatives.\nOne AI stock that has been a bit of a surprise for investors is AMD. Granted, the maker of CPUs, GPUs, and embedded chips was already doing well after bouncing back from the brink of bankruptcy a decade ago with the help of then-new CEO Lisa Su. It had even claimed some victories on the GPU and gaming fronts, becoming the chip provider of choice for video game platforms like Microsoft's Xbox and the Sony PlayStation.\nBut then came the AI wave and its AI chip offerings helped its data center segment boost revenue 80% year over year in the latest quarter.\nAMD's AI chip technology lags behind Nvidia's, but the overwhelming demand created supply issues with Nvidia's AI chips and lower prices for AMD's chips helped the semiconductor specialist increase sales.\nIts increased AI-related sales are helping AMD counterbalance slowing sales in its gaming and embedded segments. Amid that performance, AMD's overall revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $5.5 billion, a year-over-year increase of only 2%.\nStill, its revenue numbers offer some hope. In Q1, data center revenue was 43% of overall revenue, closely resembling Nvidia's revenue situation in fiscal 2022, when its data center revenue was 39% of the company's total revenue. In the first quarter of Nvidia's fiscal 2025 (ended April 28), that percentage share of overall revenue had grown to 87%.\nAMD cannot guarantee that its data center segment will make up the same high percentage of its revenue as Nvidia's in two years. Nonetheless, if the semiconductor stock can follow that path to some degree, investors could see revenue moving significantly higher. Such a prospect could prompt investors to overlook AMD's price-to-sales ratio of 11 and buy more of its stock.\nAnother possible opportunity in this industry is UiPath. UiPath is one of the leading robotics process automation (RPA) companies, specializing in software robots designed to handle repetitive tasks.\nDespite a relatively small $6.8 billion market cap, the robotics stock stands out from much larger competitors thanks to a 2.5 million-member developer community. This brings a large number of developers under its ecosystem, which makes switching to an alternate RPA product more difficult.\nEstimates vary on the growth of the RPA market, but a more conservative estimate by Fortune Business Insights projects the industry will grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate through 2030.\nUnfortunately, this company also faces some significant challenges. CEO Rob Enslin, who had served as co-CEO for two years, suddenly resigned after serving as the sole CEO since January. Co-founder Daniel Dines is back in charge of the company, but that still does not address the longer-term uncertainties about its top leadership.\nIts financials may also fail to inspire at the moment. Revenue for the first quarter of 2025 (ended April 30) was $335 million, a year-over-year increase of 16%. Unfortunately, its net loss of $29 million did not improve significantly from the $32 million loss in the year-ago quarter.\nHowever, with stock-based compensation expenses at $89 million, its losses are driven by a noncash expense. This shows it is meeting its operational expenses.\nMoreover, its P/S ratio is 5, near all-time lows. Hence, if investors are looking for an inexpensive AI stock and they can handle some (hopefully) short-term uncertainty, they might have a lucrative opportunity in UiPath stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged higher (again) on Wednesday, jumping as much as 5.2%. At the end of the day, the stock was still up 5.2%, putting its market cap above $3 trillion for the first time.\nSeveral developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) helped fuel the stock's relentless rise.\nAs the leading provider of graphics processing units (GPUs) used in artificial intelligence (AI), it seems any bit of positive news in the space can be a catalyst for Nvidia stock. The phenomenon was in full view today.\nNews broke that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, also called TSMC, is purchasing a high-NA extreme ultraviolet machine from ASML. This marks the latest in AI chipmaking technology, and Nvidia is TSMC's second-largest customer, giving it full access to this top-of-the-line tech.\nIn an unrelated development, Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported the results of its fiscal second quarter (ended April 30), and the results blew past even the most bullish expectations. While the company generated modest year-over-year gains, it cited growing demand for AI as the catalyst for its better-than-expected results.\nWhat do these developments have to do with Nvidia? Nothing, at least not directly. However, it does illustrate that the demand for AI continues to accelerate, bolstering the theory that it's still very early days for AI. Consequently, what's good for AI seems to be good for Nvidia.\nThe company has been among the biggest beneficiaries of AI adoption, as Nvidia's processors are the gold standard for AI use cases. While estimates vary, Nvidia is credited with a market share of roughly 90% of the AI chip market.\nFinally, excitement has reached a fever pitch ahead of Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split, which is scheduled to take place after the market close on Friday.\nThe adoption of generative AI continues to gain steam. While estimates vary wildly, the size of the market is expected to be between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion in the coming years, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\nThe growing body of evidence suggests there's still plenty of room left for Nvidia to run.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Geoff Colvin ",
        "Text": "In the annals of business success stories few saw coming, Nvidia\u2019s incredible rise to surpass Microsoft and become the world\u2019s most valuable company is one for the books. This past week Nvidia, cofounded by Jensen Huang, edged out Microsoft as its market cap soared to $3.42 trillion. Yet it could have been otherwise. As business leaders marvel at Nvidia\u2019s rise, it\u2019s worth remembering that another company\u2014Intel\u2014came tantalizingly close to being where Nvidia is now.\nInstead, Intel is waging a heroic effort to regain its place as the world\u2019s preeminent maker of leading edge chips. The story of how it lost that position is part of a recent Fortune case study.\nAs detailed in the piece, a key moment occurred in the mid-2000s, when Paul Otellini, then CEO of Intel, said a word to Steve Jobs he almost never heard: No.\nIt was 2006, and Intel, the global king of computer chips, was bringing in record revenue and profits by dominating the kinds of chips in hottest demand\u2014for personal computers and data centers. Now Jobs wanted Intel to make a different type of chip for a product that didn\u2019t even exist, which would be called the iPhone.\nOtellini knew chips for phones and tablets were the next big thing, but Intel had to devote substantial capital and its best minds to the fabulously profitable business it already possessed. Besides, \u201cno one knew what the iPhone would do,\u201d he told\u00a0The Atlantic\u00a0seven years later, just before he stepped down as CEO. \u201cThere was a chip that they were interested in, that they wanted to pay a certain price for and not a nickel more, and that price was below our forecasted cost. I couldn\u2019t see it.\u201d\nOtellini, who died in 2017, was a highly successful CEO by many measures. But if that decision had gone the other way, Intel might have become a chip titan of the post-PC era. Instead, it gave up on phone chips in 2016 after losing billions trying to become a significant player. As he left the company, Otellini seemed to grasp the magnitude of his decision: \u201cThe world would have been a lot different if we\u2019d done it.\u201d\nMeantime, some 800 miles north, in Seattle,\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0was struggling to find its role in a tech world dominated by the internet, mobile devices, social media, and search. Investors were not impressed by its efforts. No one could have foreseen that years later, a few key decisions would set the company up as an AI powerhouse and send its stock soaring.\nThere was a time not so long ago that Microsoft and Intel were both atop the tech world. They were neither competitors nor significant customers of each other, but what New York University\u2019s Adam Brandenburger and Yale\u2019s Barry Nalebuff deemed \u201ccomplementors.\u201d Microsoft built its hugely profitable Windows operating system over the years to work on computers that used Intel\u2019s chips, and Intel designed new chips to run Windows (hence \u201cWintel\u201d). The system fueled the leading tech product of the 1990s, the personal computer. Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates became a celebrity wonk billionaire, and Intel CEO Andy Grove was\u00a0Time\u2019s 1997 Man of the Year.\nSnubbing Steve Jobs wasn\u2019t the only cause of Intel\u2019s decline, but it was a significant one. Intel also tried and failed to develop a GPU (graphics processing unit), which turned out to be the type of chip used in AI development and that Nvidia designs. What if Intel had succeeded? It was the world\u2019s sixth most valuable company in 2000 and the largest maker of semiconductors; today it\u2019s No. 69 by value and No. 2 in semiconductors by revenue, far behind No. 1 TSMC (and in some years also behind\u00a0Samsung).\nA Fortune 500 CEO makes thousands of decisions in a career, a few of which will turn out to be momentous. What\u2019s easy to explain in hindsight\u2014that Microsoft would be at the forefront of AI, that\u00a0Google\u00a0would become a behemoth, that Blockbuster would fade into obscurity\u2014is never preordained. Often the fateful decisions are identifiable only in retrospect. Nothing more vividly illustrates this than the parallel stories of Microsoft and Intel, and the failures at the latter that cleared the way for the moonshot rise of Nvidia. The case study of what went right and wrong at these giant corporations offers a master class in business strategy not just for today\u2019s front-runners at the likes of Nvidia, Google, Open AI,\u00a0Amazon, and elsewhere\u2014but also for any Fortune 500 leader hoping to survive and thrive in the coming decade.\nYou can read the full case study here.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n.\n"

        "Text": "By Krystal Hu\n(Reuters) - Canadian AI startup Cohere has raised $450 million in funding from returning investors such as Nvidia and Salesforce Ventures, as well as new investors including Cisco and Canadian pension fund PSP Investments, according to a source familiar the matter.\nThis concludes the first tranche of Cohere's monthslong fundraising efforts, while the company is still in talks to raise more in the same round at $5 billion valuation, added the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nThe funding marks a jump in valuation from Cohere's last private raise, when it was valued at $2.2 billion from investors including Inovia Capital last June.\nThe generative AI company, which makes money by selling its models and applications to enterprises with a emphasis on data privacy, generated $35 million in annualized revenue by the end of March, up from $13 million last year, the source added.\nCohere declined to comment. Nvidia and Salesforce did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\nCohere was set out to raise between $500 million to $1 billion, Reuters previously reported. It competes with OpenAI, Anthropic and Mistral, which have also raised billions of dollars of strategic investors such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon.\nFoundation model AI companies have been racing to raise capital to fund the expensive development of AI models that require huge amounts of computing power and top industry talent.\nOne of the most high-profile Canadian startups, Cohere is likely to benefit from the Canadian government's plan to invest C$2.4 billion ($1.77 billion) to fund compute and AI research for homegrown AI companies.\nFounded in 2019, Toronto-headquartered Cohere builds large language models - software systems that are trained on large amounts of data and can generate text. Unlike OpenAI's tie-up with Microsoft, it has steered clear of exclusive deals with cloud providers, despite being backed by Oracle.\nWhile AI startups largely remain money-losing given the training cost, every company is trying to sell its technology to the biggest companies that can pay for it for boosted productivity. Showing revenue growth is also critical in deciding if they could raise more capital.\nThe funding craze of AI startups is already slowing down, especially on the early stage side. Venture capital deal value for pre-seed and seed-stage AI deals dropped by 76% in the first quarter this year to $122.9 million, from its peak of $517.7 million in Q3 2023, according to PitchBook data.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Will Dunham)\n"

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have gotten off to red-hot starts so far in 2024, with each index already boasting double-digit returns.\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that one of the biggest tailwinds fueling the capital markets right now is artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, a collective of megacap tech businesses known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" have enjoyed some of the biggest gains so far this year.\nWithin the Magnificent Seven, shares of semiconductor company Nvidia are already up a sizzling 123% in 2024. A return of this magnitude might imply that investors just can't get enough of Nvidia, and perhaps it's too late to enjoy the ride.\nBut savvy investors understand that there are many other opportunities besides Nvidia in the chip market. Brad Gerstner is a hedge fund manager who founded the investment firm Altimeter Capital.\nAccording to Altimeter's most recent filings, Gerstner actually trimmed his position in Nvidia by a nominal 6,515 shares during the first quarter. Moreover, Gerstner initiated a new position in a different semiconductor company, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO).\nLet's explore how Broadcom is performing, and what makes it a compelling opportunity for long-term investors interested in AI.\nNot all semiconductor businesses are the same. Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices focus on the design aspects of graphics processing units (GPUs) used for generative AI applications. However, both of these companies outsource the manufacturing process of their chips to fabrication specialists like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\nRight now, I'd wager that the aspects of the semiconductor industry experiencing the most demand are chipmakers and data center service providers. Fortunately for Nvidia, the company sits at the intersection of both of these areas -- hence the company is witnessing record sales and profit growth each quarter.\nWhile this is encouraging for Nvidia investors, diversifying your exposure to semiconductors more broadly may be a good idea. The reason? As time goes on, other aspects of the chip space will begin to see some momentum beyond just buying chips or data center services.\nBroadcom specializes in network infrastructure.\nIf you've ever used a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT, you might notice that the answers to your prompts occasionally experience delays or stall out, resulting in an error message. The simple explanation for this is that LLMs process enormous amounts of data.\nMoreover, depending on the sophistication of your input (the prompt entered into the LLM), the model may require strong network connectivity in order to complete the task. Broadcom specializes in this process. In other words, while Broadcom is not the poster child of the latest generative AI model, the company's expertise plays a major role behind the scenes relating to performance.\nIn addition to ChatGPT, some of the more commonly used LLMs include Alphabet's Gemini, Meta Platforms' Llama, and Amazon's Claude. While the pros and cons of each model are up for debate, all of them are fairly new. Given their nascency and the fact that big tech is still very much in the research and development stage of commercializing these products, Broadcom's services remain slightly protracted at the moment.\nHowever, according to Research and Markets, the global addressable market for network and switching AI data center solutions is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38% between 2024 and 2029 -- reaching $19.4 billion by the end of the decade.\nAs secular tailwinds continue fueling the overall AI narrative, Broadcom's business should begin to see an uptick in demand as network connectivity continues to be a major source for data centers.\nThe chart below illustrates the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for a number of different types of chip businesses. With a P/E of 52, Broadcom is valued at a premium compared to many peers. This could suggest that there is a bullish undercurrent surrounding network solutions.\nA prudent approach to investing in Broadcom would be to use dollar-cost averaging. This strategy will allow you to buy shares over a long-term time horizon at varying prices. As a result, you can monitor Broadcom's growth curve over time, and benefit from opening a position during a period of outsize momentum.\nWhile shares of Broadcom are indeed a bit pricey, I wouldn't balk at the valuation.

        "Text": "Cloud data platform, Snowflake, has announced an expanded partnership with Nvidia to help enterprise customers build bespoke, use-case specific AI applications.\nThe partnership was announced on 3 June at Snowflake Summit 2024 by CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy and Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang and will see Nvidia\u2019s AI enterprise software integrated into Snowflake\u2019s Cortex AI LLM.\nPairing Nvidia\u2019s full stack accelerated computing and software with Snowflake\u2019s Cortex AI LLM will enable customers from every industry and every skill level to build custom AI applications based on their enterprise data with ease, efficiency and trust, according to Ramaswamy.\nThe announcement continues an existing collaboration between Snowflake and Nvidia to deliver a single, unified AI infrastructure and compute platform in the AI data cloud.\nSnowflake\u2019s mission to enable enterprises to build foundational models aligns with AI market trends. According to research and analysis company GlobalData\u2019s 2024 AI predictions, organisations will increasingly use smaller, more vertically focused and domain-specific models.\nSmall language models (SLMs) have several advantages over LLMs, including cost savings and the potential to address privacy concerns, according to GlobalData\u2019s thematic intelligence executive briefing on AI.\nBy using self-hosted or smaller models, companies will be able to train the models on their own data, increasing accuracy and relevance as well as increasing efficiency and creating cost savings. In fact, some tasks, including code generation and customer service applications, are particularly suited to SLMs.\nAddressing an audience at the Snowflake Summit 2024, Huang outlined a paradigm shift in the way data is processed which is enabled by the Snowflake and Nvidia's collaboration.\nEnterprise data processing is becoming increasingly complex as volumes grow exponentially. By bringing high performance computing to the data rather than moving data to computing access points saves time and money, according to Huang, who described the shift as \u201cprofound\u201d. AI development is moving so fast that \u201ctime to market is everything,\u201d he added.\nGlobalData forecasts that the overall AI market will be worth $909bn by 2030, having grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% between 2022 and 2030. In the generative AI space, revenues are expected to grow from $1.8bn in 2022 to $33bn in 2027 at a CAGR of 80%.\n\"Snowflake announces partnership with Nvidia to develop enterprise AI\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Jody Godoy ",
        "Text": "By Jody Godoy\n(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have reached a deal that clears the way for potential antitrust investigations into the dominant roles that Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia play in the artificial intelligence industry, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nThe agreement between the two agencies shows regulatory scrutiny is gathering steam amid concerns over concentration in the industries that make up AI. Microsoft and Nvidia not only dominate their industries but are two of the world's biggest companies by market capitalization since Nvidia's market value recently surpassed $3 trillion.\nU.S. antitrust enforcers have publicly expressed a range of concerns around AI, from the advantage that Big Tech companies have in their access to data used to train AI models, to how generative AI affects the market for creative work, to partnerships between companies potentially being used to sidestep required merger review processes.\nThe move to divvy up the industry mirrors a similar agreement between the two agencies in 2019 to divide enforcement against Big Tech, which ultimately saw the FTC bring cases against Meta and Amazon, and the DOJ sue Apple and Google for alleged violations. Those cases are ongoing and the companies have denied wrongdoing.\nWhile OpenAI's parent is a nonprofit, Microsoft has invested $13 billion in a for-profit subsidiary, for what would be a 49% stake.\nThe Justice Department will take the lead in investigating whether Nvidia violated antitrust laws, while the FTC will examine the conduct of OpenAI and Microsoft.\nThe regulators struck the deal over the past week, and it is expected to be completed in the coming days, the person said.\nNvidia has roughly 80% of the AI chip market, including the custom AI processors made by the cloud computing companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon.com. That domination helps the company report gross margins between 70% and 80%.\nSpokespersons for Nvidia and OpenAI declined to comment on the regulators' agreement on Thursday. Microsoft said it takes its legal obligations to report transactions seriously and is confident it has complied with them.\nThe agreement between the two regulators comes after the FTC in January ordered OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Anthropic to provide information on recent investments and partnerships involving generative AI companies and cloud service providers.\nIn July last year, the FTC opened an investigation into OpenAI on claims it had run afoul of consumer protection laws by putting personal reputations and data at risk.\nLast week, Justice Department antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter said at an AI conference at Stanford University that there are \"structures and trends in AI that should give us pause,\" adding that the technology relies on massive amounts of data and computing power, which can give already dominant firms a substantial advantage.\nThe DOJ and FTC, led by Chair Lina Khan, share jurisdiction to enforce federal competition law but avoid duplicative investigations.\nBill Baer, who led antitrust efforts at the agencies during the Obama and Clinton administrations, said that typically each agency will take the lead in areas where it has amassed expertise. But occasionally the heads of the two agencies will sit down and iron out who does what, said Baer, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution.\nMICROSOFT DEAL\nThe FTC is also looking into Microsoft's $650 million deal with AI startup Inflection AI, over concerns as to whether the deal was a play to skirt merger disclosure requirements, the person said.\nThe unusual deal reached in March allowed Microsoft to use Inflection's models and hire most of the startup's staff, including its co-founders.\nMicrosoft said in a statement on Monday that the agreement with Inflection helped it accelerate work on Microsoft Copilot, while still allowing Inflection \"to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio.\"\nThe probe was first reported by the Wall Street Journal and the regulators' agreement on AI by the New York Times.\n(Reporting by Gnaneshwar Rajan in Bengaluru and Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Mrigank Dhaniwala, Chizu Nomiyama and Lisa Shumaker)\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of top 10 AI stocks Wall Street analysts are upgrading. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd in the list. That's why the stock deserves a deeper look.\nThere has been much uproar about AI stock valuations and how investors are overpaying for mega-cap tech stocks that are promising something that still lies far into the future \u2014 productivity gains, real-life AI products and AGI. But the market doesn\u2019t seem to care what the AI skeptics and naysayers believe. There seems to be no end in sight to the AI-led gains in stocks. And analysts are expecting more. Goldman Sachs's Scott Rubner recently said that he sees a \"wall of money\" heading towards the market. Rubner pointed towards the whopping $7.3 trillion sitting in money market funds and said he believes the floodgates are about to open and investors would funnel that money into stocks. According to Rubner's model, the third quarter of 2024 is when we should expect billions ($29 billion, to be precise) to be flushed into the market.\nOne doesn\u2019t need to have a crystal ball to know where all of those billions would be headed. AI is the promising theme everyone is betting on and that everyone includes experts, billionaires, money managers and long-term value investors. Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that investors have been \"hesitant\" for much of the year, but they should just \"stick\" with \"what's working.\" AI, weight loss drugs and related themes is what's working these days, according to Lee.\nMethodology\nFor this article we picked the top AI stocks Wall Street analysts recently upgraded or gave bullish comments about.

His wealth has surged more than $62 billion this year as demand for Nvidia chips used to power artificial intelligence tasks remains insatiable.\nHuang, 61, is leading a new wave of tech billionaires as AI-fueled \u201cJensanity,\u201d as one analyst termed it, takes over Silicon Valley. Other beneficiaries include Lisa Su, chief executive officer of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., as well as Super Micro Computer Inc.\u2019s Charles Liang. Last month, Huang\u2019s fortune surpassed each individual member of the Waltons, America\u2019s richest family, following another blowout quarter from the chipmaker.\nHuang\u2019s wealth is derived from his 3.5% stake in Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia, which he co-founded in 1993 with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Nvidia became the first computer-chip company to hit $3 trillion in market capitalization on Wednesday, surpassing the value of Apple Inc., and was flirting with that benchmark again on Friday.\nDell, 59, with a net worth of $105.9 billion, has been a computer hardware-industry outlier among the tech super-rich, who often owe their wealth to software companies. Dell made much of his fortune through his namesake firm, which sells personal computers and servers.\nStill, Dell Technologies Inc. has been a beneficiary of the recent AI success as corporations need servers and other infrastructure to utilize advanced chips from Nvidia. Investors have increasingly seen Dell, along with Super Micro, as Nvidia\u2019s chosen partner for this business line.\nIn early March, Dell joined the small group of people with fortunes exceeding $100 billion as the company\u2019s shares rose to a record high. The stock has since retreated after posting results that disappointed investors, reducing its founder\u2019s wealth almost $12 billion in a single day.\nNvidia today commands an ecosystem of hardware and software solutions that rivals from AMD to Intel Corp. are trying hard to break up or replicate, thanks to its dominant share of the market for the high-end accelerators used to train AI.\nAnd it has shown no signs of slowing down or letting its rivals catch up. Huang said the firm plans to upgrade its so-called AI accelerators every year.\n--With assistance from Jack Witzig.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon\nIsraeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War\nGrieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy\nThe World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics\nChina\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 6.5% in the afternoon session after the stock continued to pull back, suggesting investors are likely taking profits following a spectacular year-to-date run. Nvidia attained a rare feat earlier in the month (June 2024): It became the most valuable stock in the world, with a market cap of more than $3 Trillion and a year-to-date return in excess of 150% in June 2024.\nThe recent declines suggested that some may be beginning to think that too much optimism is priced into the stock. We'd note that the company hasn't shown any blemishes lately, with Q1'2024 earnings coming in quite strong and above expectations.\nThe quarter specifically blew past Wall Street's sales and profitability expectations, mostly due to better-than-expected results in its data center and automotive segments. Despite growing macro headwinds amid a cyclical downturn, which has dampened the performance of other semiconductor companies, Nvidia provided forward revenue guidance ahead of Consensus, demonstrating that demand for its products\u2014especially its much-coveted AI solutions\u2014remains strong.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 11 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 27 days ago, when the stock\u00a0 gained 7.5% on continued strong momentum following a strong earnings report in the previous week. This helped drive the Nasdaq to a record high. The tech-heavy index crossed the 17,000 mark.\nThere was also some positive news over the weekend. The Information reported that Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, announced plans to buy Nvidia's AI chips for its new supercomputer. On Monday, May 27, 2024, xAI announced its series B funding round on the social media platform X.com (formerly called Twitter). The AI start-up raised $ 6 billion to \"take xAI's first products to market\" and to \"build advanced Infrastructure.\"\nAccording to the reports, it is likely that the development of the infrastructure will birth a massive computing system - dubbed \"the Gigafactory of computing\" - which is expected to use 100,000 semiconductors based on NVDA's H100 GPU, and with an estimated size exceeding 4x the biggest cluster in existence.\nOverall, the report suggested that it is still early days in the hot AI market while providing more definitive insight into the growing demand for Nvidia's AI chips.\nNvidia is up 148% since the beginning of the year, but at $119.60 per share it is still trading 11.8% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $31,347.\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n"

        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) completed its 10-for-1 stock split after market close on Friday, June 7. Like most forward stock splits, this one followed significant share price appreciation. The stock surged 225% during the past year and 850% since November 2022, when the launch of ChatGPT sparked the artificial intelligence (AI) gold rush.\nNvidia remains well-positioned to benefit as more businesses invest in AI. Indeed, it is arguably the best pure-play AI stock. However, stock splits have historically been bad news for Nvidia shareholders. The company's value has declined by an average of 23% during the 12-month period following past splits.\nHere's what investors should know.\nExcluding the most recent one, Nvidia has completed five stock splits as a public company, and shares have consistently declined afterwards. The chart below details when each stock split took place, and it shows how the stock performed during the next six months, 12 months, and 24 months.\nStock Split Date\n6-Month Return\n12-Month Return\n24-Month Return\nJune 2000\n(50%)\n28%\n(52%)\nSeptember 2001\n44%\n(72%)\n(49%)\nApril 2006\n63%\n1%\n(6%)\nSeptember 2007\n(45%)\n(70%)\n(53%)\nJuly 2021\n30%\n(4%)\n145%\nAverage\n8%\n(23%)\n(3%)\nData source: YCharts.\nAs shown above, following the last five stock splits, Nvidia returned by an average of 8% during the next six months. But shares declined by an average of 23% during the 12-month period following the split, and the stock was still down by an average of 3% after 24 months. In short, history says Nvidia could suffer a severe drawdown in the not-so-distant future.\nOf course, past performance is never a guarantee of future results, and that saying rings particularly true here. Four of the last five stock splits occurred in close proximity to severe bear markets. Specifically, the S&P 500 declined 49% between March 2000 and October 2002 due to the dot-com bubble, and it declined 57% between October 2007 and March 2009 due to the global financial crisis.\nThose market crashes notwithstanding, there has still been a silver lining for patient investors. Nvidia shares ultimately rebounded following all five stock splits and produced phenomenal long-term returns. The chart below shows the magnitude of those returns as of June 12, 2024.\nGoing forward, whether Nvidia is a good or bad investment depends on two things: (1) how quickly the semiconductor company can grow earnings per share, and (2) how much investors are willing to pay for those earnings.\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have a near-monopoly in accelerated computing, a discipline that uses specialized hardware and software to speed up complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics.\nNvidia products consistently set performance records in AI training and inference at the MLPerf benchmarks, standardized tests that provide unbiased evaluations of AI systems. Additionally, the company holds more than 90% market share in data center GPUs and more than 80% market share in AI chips.\nNvidia bears brush aside those strengths and cite mounting competition as cause for alarm. Specifically, they point to semiconductor companies like AMD and cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, all of which are building chips to supplant Nvidia GPUs. But that bearish argument ignores the formidable economic moat Nvidia has in its full-stack strategy.\nCEO Jensen Huang recently told analysts: \"We literally build the entire data center.\" He means Nvidia is no mere chipmaker, but rather a full-stack computing company. Nvidia supplements its GPUs with central processing units (CPUs) and networking hardware that's purpose-built for artificial intelligence. The company also offers subscription software and cloud services that support AI workflows across numerous end markets, from manufacturing and logistics to customer service and healthcare.\nThe heart of Nvidia's full-stack computing platform is CUDA, a parallel programming language that allows GPUs (originally engineered for graphics processing) to function as data center accelerators. The CUDA ecosystem is comprised of hundreds of frameworks and software libraries that streamline the development of complex applications. That gives Nvidia an immense advantage, because no other chipmaker has a comparable ecosystem of supporting software.\nTo quote Morningstar analyst Brian Colello, \"CUDA is proprietary to Nvidia and only runs on its GPUs, and we believe this hardware plus software integration has created high customer switching costs in AI, contributing to Nvidia's wide moat.\"\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 31.7% annually over the next three to five years. If that number is divided into its current price-to-earnings multiple of 75.8, the quotient is a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 2.4. That multiple is a discount to the three-year average of 3.2, but it's still relatively pricey on an absolute basis.\nThat said, the consensus earnings forecast leaves room for upside. Spending on AI hardware, software, and services is forecasted to compound at 36.6% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. Nvidia could certainly match that pace, and perhaps exceed it. To that end, its current valuation could appear quite reasonable or even cheap in hindsight.\nUltimately, investors have a somewhat difficult decision here, but I think Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley has the right idea. \"[W]e think the backdrop warrants AI exposure even amid extreme enthusiasm -- and Nvidia remains the clearest way to get that exposure,\" he wrote in a recent note to clients.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Two of the major stock indexes declined on Thursday after touching record highs earlier in the session. Nvidia's (NVDA) record-breaking surge \u2014 which catapulted it to the title of world's most valuable public company \u2014 also took a breather.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost around 0.2% after briefly crossing 5,500 for the first time, as the index couldn't build on a 31st record close of the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) touched new highs earlier in the session but closed sharply down, almost 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose roughly 0.7%, or about 300 points.\nAfter a holiday break on Wednesday, Wall Street struggled to continue its winning ways in 2024. Stocks' growth story this year has been largely driven by the excitement around AI's potential, and no company has captured the collective attention like Nvidia. For a while, it seemed like the AI party would continue.\nBut shares of the chip giant fell more than 3% on Thursday. Despite the dip, the stock is still up more than 170% so far this year.\nOn Tuesday Nvidia completed a remarkably quick surge to temporarily usurp Microsoft (MSFT) as the most valuable company in the world \u2014 just two weeks after it dethroned Apple (AAPL) as the No. 2 most valuable company. Its rise to the top has come so fast, Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre wrote, that some more passive investors haven't been able to keep up.\nElsewhere on Thursday, global central banks were in focus as the Swiss National Bank cut rates for the second time this year. The Bank of England kept its benchmark rate at a 16-year high, but signals pointed to a rate cut in the summer.\nIn the US, meanwhile, most traders continue to bet on a Fed cut by September, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The biggest piece of economic data came in the form of weekly jobless claims, which showed a dip of 5,000 to 238,000 last week versus a consensus expectation of 235,000.\nStocks ended Thursday\u2019s trading session mixed with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) just off their record highs.\nThe Nasdaq fell about 0.8% while the S&P 500 slid 0.2% after briefly surpassing the 5,500 level earlier in the session.\nNvidia stock (NVDA) reversed its gains from earlier in the day to lose more than 3% as technology stocks declined.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8%.\nChip stocks were among Thursday's laggards, dragging on the Nasdaq (^IXIC) and S&P 500 (^GSPC).\nShares of Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 3%, while Broadcom (AVGO) also fell. Qualcomm (QCOM) and Micron (MU) also fell.\nNvidia erased earlier session gains as the stock, along with other technology-related names, weighed on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P 500 briefly touched the 5,500 level this morning before falling in afternoon trading.\nOn Thursday, West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) rose slightly to settle at $82.17 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, inched to $85.71 per barrel.\nWTI is on pace for its second weekly gain following a sell-off in May. US crude futures are up roughly 14% year to date, while Brent has gained 12% during the same period.\nHigher oil prices lifted energy-related stocks on Thursday, with the S&P 500 Energy Select ETF (XLE) rising more than 2%.\nYahoo Finance's Allie Canal reports:\nAmazon (AMZN) entered the ad-supported streaming space in January by defaulting all of its Prime Video subscriptions to ads. Just six months later, the tech giant's impact is already being felt.\nPrime Video subscriptions now automatically default to the ad-supported tier at current monthly rates of $14.99 for Prime delivery members and $8.99 for non-Prime members \u2014or those who only subscribe to the standalone video service. Subscribers who want the ad-free version will now see their monthly bill go up by $3 a month.\nAmazon's entrance builds on the presence of Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS), which introduced their respective ad tiers in late 2022. That means an already accelerated expansion of ad-supported options for consumers \u2014 along with prospective ad buyers.\nRead more here. \nNvidia (NVDA) stock erased its morning session gains to dip more than 4% on Thursday. The chip giant opened higher before falling into red territory and dragging on the Nasdaq and S&P 500.\nNvidia surpassed Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday as the most valuable company in the world. On Thursday afternoon however, the software giant took back the crown as its valuation sat slightly above Nvidia's market cap.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped into red territory on Thursday, reversing earlier morning gains.\nBoth indexes opened the session higher with the S&P 500 briefly crossing the 5,500 level. By 12:50 p.m. ET the broader benchmark was down nearly 0.2% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 0.5%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) still clung to gains as Salesforce (CRM) and ExxonMobil (XOM) led the blue-chip index up 0.4%.\nShares of Dell (DELL) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) popped Thursday after xAI founder Elon Musk said the companies are providing hardware for the supercomputer his AI startup is building.\nAs Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports, the moves higher underscore Wall Street's excitement around AI technology.\nInvestors are clamoring to buy into AI businesses at every level of development, from major consumer-facing brands selling AI-powered apps to manufacturers providing the chips and servers powering the computing infrastructure.\nShares of Dell rose as high as 5% Thursday, while Super Micro's stock climbed nearly 9% before paring gains.\nDell's CEO Michael Dell set up the jump for his company's share price when he said in a post on X Wednesday, \u201cWe\u2019re building a Dell AI factory with Nvidia to power Grok for xAI.\"\nEnergy-related stocks led Thursday's gains, with the S&P 500 Energy Select ETF (XLE) up more than 1%, helping boost the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to new highs.\nOil giants ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) each rose more than 1.5%. The energy sector has gained more than 7% this year compared to the broader benchmark's 15% year-to-date gains.\nOn Thursday, the S&P 500 rose as much as 0.5%, briefly crossing the 5,500 level for the first time.\nThe top trending tickers on Yahoo Finance on Thursday were all tech-related.\nNvidia (NVDA)\nShares of the chip giant rose as much as 3% Thursday morning, climbing to new highs. Earlier this week Nvidia overtook Microsoft (MSFT) as the most valuable company in the world. \nDell Technologies (DELL) \nDell stock rose after CEO Michael Dell revealed the hardware giant was collaborating with Nvidia to construct an AI factory for xAI, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence venture.\n\"We\u2019re building a Dell AI factory with @nvidia to power @grok for @xai @elonmusk,\" wrote Dell on X on Wednesday.\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\nSMCI jumped more than 8% after billionaire Elon Musk indicated that his artificial intelligence startup xAI will utilize Dell and Super Micro Computer's server racks.\nYear to date the stock is up more than 240%.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) crossed the 5,500 level for the first time on Thursday as Nvidia (NVDA) stock continued its steady climb.\nThe broader index rose 0.5% after notching its 31st record close of the year on Tuesday.\nTech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) inched 0.3% higher to also touch record highs during Thursday's session.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%.\nNew government data released Thursday showed construction activity for residential housing tumbled to the lowest level in four years.\nHousing starts declined 5.5% in May from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.277 million. Economists polled by Bloomberg were expecting starts to come in at 1.370 million.\n\u201cThe drop in housing starts in May is consistent with the recent slowdown in permit issuance, pointing to construction continuing to falter this year,\u201d Thomas Ryan, North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote after the release.\n\u201cThis challenges our forecast that construction, particularly in the single-family sector, would flourish this year given the lack of alternatives for buyers in the resale market.\u201d\nSeparate data released Wednesday showed that homebuilders are losing confidence about the housing market. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) fell to a five-month low of 43 in June. Builders noted that 7% mortgage rates were the culprit, pushing many would-be buyers to the sidelines.\nThe Nasdaq and S&P 500 opened higher on Thursday as shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued to climb.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained roughly 0.4% to hit a fresh record high after notching its 31st record close of the year on Tuesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell just below the flatline.\nNvidia became the world's most valuable public company on Tuesday. Its ascension following the Juneteenth holiday continued on Thursday morning as shares rose more than 2%.\n"

        "Author": "South China Morning Post ",
        "Text": "A Beijing-based graphics processing unit (GPUs) design firm founded by a former Nvidia executive is generating excitement among Chinese video gamers in a sign of the country's ability to quickly find substitutes for foreign brands in consumer-grade technology.\nMoore Threads Technology, which was added to a US trade blacklist at the end of 2023, has emerged as a key competitor in a semiconductor market segment that globally is dominated by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\nAfter the company recently expanded the number of supported titles for its MTT S80 to 130, up from 13 when the GPU launched in late 2022, players online have been favourably comparing it with Nvidia hardware, with many people touting its ability to measure up to GeForce RTX 3060 despite real-world use showing a large performance gap.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\"It is on par with Nvidia's products like the GTX 3060 in common situations, but there's still a gap when playing AAA games,\" said Eliot Yang Bingshi, a 23-year-old computer gamer in southwestern Sichuan province.\nJams Zhang Jianzhong, CEO of Moore Threads Technology, speaks at the launch of KUAE, a GPU-based computing platform for artificial intelligence training system, on December 19, 2023.

Photo: Moore Threads Technology>\nThat gap could be worth it for people who play older popular games like League of Legends and World of Warcraft, which the card now officially supports, as it comes with a steep discount. The MTT S80's 1,499 yuan (US$200) price tag on e-commerce site JD.com is about 40 per cent below the price of the 4-year-old RTX 3060.\nThat makes the S80 a great alternative, Yang said.\nOnline benchmarks show the S80's performance significantly lags the performance of Nvidia cards released eight years ago. Benchmark results posted by PC Watch to X, formerly Twitter, last year showed the S80 being bested by the GTX 1050 Ti, released in 2016, by a significant margin in most tests.\nIt fares better against the 1050 Ti in results posted to UserBenchmark.com, where only five people have so far submitted S80 results, but Chinese chip far behind the 3060 with a global ranking of 164 compared with 64, respectively.\nMoore Threads announced the expansion of supported video game titles at the end of May, when it posted an S80 promotional video to Bilibili, a streaming platform that caters to Chinese gamers and other niche communities.\nThe company, which has not provided any sales figures for the GPU released 19 months ago, thanked Chinese gamers for supporting the country's \"only hope in the graphics card industry\".\nNvidia, the world's third most valuable company at about US$3 trillion, has gradually been losing the China market, where it is unable to sell its most advanced GPUs, particularly those used for artificial intelligence (AI), because of US export restrictions.\nThis has left the field open for domestic players like Huawei, whose own AI chips have been eating up market share.\nThe gaming GPU market has become less important for Nvidia given the skyrocketing demand for its advanced AI chips. The global gaming GPU market is expected to reach US$15.7 billion by 2029, up from US$3.7 billion this year, according to Mordor Intelligence, a data provider.\nWhile the video gaming market is smaller than AI, general-purpose GPUs can be used for training and running less demanding AI models.\nMoore Threads, founded by Jams Zhang Jianzhong in 2020, hopes to become a \"little Nvidia\" with breakthroughs in GPU development within China. Zhang previously worked at Nvidia as the global vice-president and general manager of China before leaving to start Moore Threads.\nThe start-up announced last week that it has deployed its KUAE AI computing system with more than 1,000 GPU cards. The system will be used to run Yuren, a large language model of seven billion parameters based on development from Baichuan, one of China's four \"AI Tigers\".\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Author": "  Paolo Confino ",
        "Text": "Shares of the hottest stock on the S&P 500 increased tenfold on Friday.\nAfter the market\u2019s close, Nvidia\u2019s 10-for-1 stock split, which was announced in May during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, went into effect. But it will do little to change the company\u2019s $3 trillion valuation or its underlying fundamentals, which so far, have investors licking their chops.\n\u201cYou and I know that a stock split is just cosmetic, at least it is for existing shareholders,\u201d says Paul Meeks, a veteran tech investor and business school professor at military college The Citadel. \u201cWith their investor relations routine, Nvidia is well aware they have to keep on throwing a few bones out there\u201d to investors.\nFew other companies have embodied the new corporate hierarchy pecking order ushered in by the proliferation of AI quite like Nvidia has. The company\u2019s stock rose 3,174% over the last five years and 218% in just the last year. During its epic run, Nvidia\u2019s market cap soared past the likes of Amazon and Alphabet. Before the 10-for-1 split, the stock was at a stratospheric $1,209.\nThat price was likely too high for most investors, certainly the retail investors the split was meant to attract, according to Humayun Sheikh, CEO of startup Fetch.ai, which provides developer tools specifically for AI. \u201cThe stock split enhances Nvidia's appeal by making shares more affordable, thus broadening its investor base,\u201d he said.\nSheikh too sees the move, at least partially, about investors\u2019 perceptions, saying it was likely \u201cinfluenced by optics\u201d and could accelerate market cap gains.\nNvidia\u2019s position as the firm that has cornered the market on providing AI developers all the chips and computing power they need isn\u2019t changing because of the stock split. In the first quarter, Nvidia\u2019s sales rose 262% annually to $26 billion, outperforming Wall Street\u2019s already lofty expectations.\nNvidia\u2019s stock rally also serves as a hint at what the AI boom could still have in store.\n\u201cNvidia's change in price over the last year is telling us something about the market, namely, that perhaps AI is the new general purpose technology, like the internet or electricity, which will have massive productivity implications across the economy, and therefore AI companies will benefit greatly,\u201d said NYU business school professor Vasant Dhar.\nStill, investors are considering a few scenarios in which things might go south for them after the stock split, even as they admit the odds are slim.\nFor Meeks, the only thing that could halt Nvidia\u2019s march to the top is an economy-wide slowdown, which he considers unlikely because he expects the U.S. will avoid a recession and that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in early 2025. In fact, he\u2019s already thinking about Nvidia\u2019s performance should the economy improve.\n\u201cIt'd be hard for these stocks to lose their gains if all of a sudden we go from wind in our face with high rates to wind at our back with low rates,\u201d Meeks said.\nMeanwhile, Sheikh said the retail investors the split was meant to attract are another possible, but unlikely, concern. Individually, retail investors may hold small amounts of Nvidia stock. But collectively, they can make up a significant portion of shares. So any shocks to the system or unexpected changes in their views on the company can still have a notable effect. One need look no further than GameStop to understand the outsize influence retail investors can have on the market.\nReducing the stock to one-tenth of its price could be a double edged sword. \u201cThis approach might appeal to Robinhood-type investors or meme stock enthusiasts,\u201d Sheikh added. \u201cHowever, if the narrative turns against Nvidia and speculative traders start selling off, it could impact the price negatively.\u201d\nBut even if that unwelcome scenario were to happen it wouldn\u2019t change all the market trends propping up the chipmaker.\n\u201cNvidia already had a huge run up in price, so any tailwind from a stock split will be miniscule in comparison to the 'fundamental' reasons for its performance,\u201d Dhar said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Eva Roytburg ",
        "Text": "Most of the world\u2019s top corporations have simple names. Steve Jobs named Apple while on a fruitarian diet, and found the name \"fun, spirited and not intimidating.\" Plus, it came before Atari in the phonebook. Microsoft is an amalgamation of the words \u201cmicrocomputer\u201d and \u201csoftware,\u201d while Walmart a combination of the last name of the superstore\u2019s founder, Sam Walton, and \u201cmart.\u201d\nNvidia\u2014which briefly held the title of the most valuable company in the world this past week\u2014challenges these simple branding conventions. The consonant-ridden name and eerie, 1990s-esque op-art logo recall its underdog, start-up roots rather than its current reality: a behemoth cornering the AI chips market.\nRegardless of its unconventionality, Nvidia\u2019s prominence demands conversation, and conversation demands pronunciation. So, what is the correct way to pronounce Nvidia?\nAccording to its website, Nvidia is pronounced \u201cen-VID-eeyah,\u201d not NUH-vid-eeyah, as many have called it.\nWhere did the 'Nvidia' name come from?\u00a0\nWhen Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang started the company with his friends Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in 1993, they hashed out almost every detail of their new business, except for the name. Sitting in a Palo Alto Denny\u2019s\u2014a venue chosen for its cheap coffee and for Huang\u2019s experience working there in his youth\u2014the three cofounders drew blanks for the title of their venture.\nSo, as they continued building, they simply named their files \u201cNV\u201d for next version, Huang previously told Fortune. When time came to incorporate the company, the three were forced to find a name. At first, they chose NVision, until they learned that a toilet paper manufacturer already took the name.\nAfter going back to the drawing board, the cofounders scraped through all words with \u201cNV\u201d in them, until Huang suggested Nvidia, riffing on the Latin word invidia, meaning \u201cenvy.\u201d\nThe name worked because the three had hopes to design such a powerful graphics chip that it would make competitors, as Priem previously told The New Yorker, \u201cgreen with envy.\u201d\nThe First 'Nvidia'\nThe first \u201cNvidia\u201d was Invidia, the Roman goddess of envy. Her heart was \u201cgreen with bile,\u201d her tongue dripped poison, she had a \u201cpallor smeared across her face, her entire body is gaunt, her eyesight squints at everything,\u201d as the Roman poet Ovid describes her in the Metamorphosis.\u00a0\nCompany branding doesn't ofter draw from Roman mythology, much less from a figure so unseemly. And yet, the envy motif appears to be littered throughout the company\u2019s products. The eighth generation of its graphics processing units had the slogan \u201cgreen with envy.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s logo, a green, spiraling eye, may have also drawn inspiration from the first Invidia.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NVDA) overtook Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday as the most valuable company in the world just two weeks after it took the No. 2 spot from Apple (AAPL).\nNvidia's stock price rose about 3.5%, eclipsing $135 per share and giving the chipmaker a market capitalization over $3.33 trillion. With a 0.4% slide on Tuesday, Microsoft's market cap stood at nearly $3.32 trillion.\nShares of Nvidia are up more than 215% over the last 12 months and more than 3,400% over the last five years. Year to date, Nvidia has gained 175%; Microsoft stock is up just less than 19% in 2024.\nNvidia first crossed a $1 trillion market cap on June 13, 2023. The stock advanced north of $2 trillion on March 1, and then rapidly crossed the $3 trillion mark for the first time on June 5. The company's advance from a $1 trillion to a $3 trillion market cap was the fastest on record.\nNvidia's surge has made it a top weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), and the chipmaker has served a pivotal role in the benchmark index hitting record highs in 2024.\nUp until May, the S&P 500 had traded with a near-perfect correlation to Nvidia's price movement, meaning that as Nvidia's stock rose, so did the broader index. As of Monday, Nvidia's stock gains alone had contributed about one-third of the S&P 500's year-to-date rise, according to data from Citi's equity research team.\nNvidia completed a 10-for-1 split on June 10. \nThe company's rise comes amid the generative AI explosion that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT platform in late 2022. Nvidia's chips, modified graphics cards, and CUDA software platform are designed to both train and run AI programs, giving it a strategic advantage that experts say will take rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) years to overcome.\nNvidia is the tech industry's go-to supplier for AI chips and integrated software.\nTech behemoths, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft, Tesla (TSLA), and others, use its hardware to power everything from their cloud-based AI offerings for customers to their own AI models and services.\nDuring a keynote at the Computex conference in Taiwan on June 2, CEO Jensen Huang announced that the company will release a high-powered version of its Blackwell chip \u2014 called the Blackwell Ultra \u2014 in 2025, followed by a new AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026. The company will debut an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027.\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\nNvidia's data center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion.\nBut AMD and Intel are pushing forward with their own AI chips with the goal of outmaneuvering Nvidia. AMD recently announced its MI325X and MI350 will hit the market in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and said its next-generation MI400 AI accelerator platform will land in 2026.\nIntel, meanwhile, said its Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators will undercut competing chips on price. And with companies spending billions on AI chips, any price savings will certainly be welcome.\nNvidia is also contending with growing competition from its own customers, as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft seek to wean themselves off of their dependence on the company's chips and save on capital expenditures while they're at it.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Nvidia became the world's most valuable company on Tuesday, dethroning tech heavyweight Microsoft, as its chips continue to play a central role in a race to dominate the market for artificial intelligence.\nShares of the chipmaker climbed 3.2% to $135.21, lifting its market capitalization to $3.326 trillion, just days after overtaking iPhone maker Apple AAPL.O to become the second most valuable company. The stock has surged about 173% so far this year, compared with a rise of about 19% in Microsoft shares.\nCOMMENTS:\nSTEVE SOSNICK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, INTERACTIVE BROKERS, NEW YORK, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT\n\"It's Nvidia's market; we're all just trading in it.\"\n\"The roster of market leaders has changed before, so it's not that surprising to see it alter again.\"\nOLIVER PURSCHE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, WEALTHSPIRE ADVISORS, NEW YORK\n\u201c(Nvidia has) certainly been high flying and predictable I don\u2019t think it ultimately matters. Nvidia has been getting a lot of positive attention and has been doing a lot of things very correctly but a small misstep is likely cause a major correction in the stock, and investors should be careful.\u201d\n\u201cAI, and generative AI in particular, is pretty clearly going to have a massive impact on a large number of industries. The broader question is they've not had to face significant competition up until now, and it will be interesting to see how well the company does as competition and choices increase.\u201d\n\u201cUp until now, if you weren\u2019t buying an Nvidia chip, you weren't buying a chip designed to support AI, and that's changing rapidly.\u201d\nWASIF LATIF, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SARMAYA PARTNERS, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY\n\"There's been a lot of strong not only hedge fund buying but also broader retail buying in Nvidia. That's likely to continue given the tools that are out there in very specific thematic funds and leveraged funds. This run might continue until we do see a slowdown in the pace of its earnings growth. The stock move is pretty well correlated to the growth of its earnings and history shows us that the high growth stocks tend to do really well as long as that earnings growth trajectory is in intact. The math tells us that the growth is not possible on a perpetual basis. At some point, you'd see the growth rate slow down and at that point you might see the market reflecting some of the slowdown in the earnings growth. Otherwise, it's growing at a point and the market is factoring in that the stock would become the largest entity on the planet.\"\n"

Apple's market capitalization was last at $3.003 trillion after its stock climbed 0.8%.\nMicrosoft, based in Redmond, Washington, remained the world's most valuable company at $3.15 trillion after its shares climbed 1.9%.\n\"Nvidia is making money on AI right now, and companies like Apple and Meta are spending on AI,\" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer at Longbow Asset Management.\n\"It may be a foregone conclusion that Nvidia will overtake Microsoft as well. There's a lot of retail money that's piling in on what they see as a straight shot up.\"\nNvidia's stock has surged 147% so far in 2024, with demand for its top-of-the-line processors far outstripping supply as Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Google-owner Alphabet race to build out their AI computing capabilities and dominate the emerging technology.\nIt has rallied nearly 30% just since May 22, when Nvidia issued its latest stellar revenue forecast.\nNvidia added nearly $150 billion in market capitalization on Wednesday, more than the entire value of AT&T.\nOptimism about AI lifted chip stocks broadly on Wednesday, with the PHLX chip index surging 4.5%. Super Micro Computer, which sells AI optimized servers built with Nvidia chips, climbed 4%.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang this week was the subject of wall-to-wall coverage on Taiwanese television and was mobbed by attendees when he visited the Computex tech trade fair in Taipei, where he was born before moving to the United States.\nWhile Nvidia rides a wave of AI enthusiasm on Wall Street, Apple is struggling with weak demand for iPhones and tough competition in China, the world's biggest smartphone market.\nSome investors also view Apple as lagging other technology heavyweights as they rush to build AI features into their products and services.\nAnalysts' projections for Nvidia's future earnings have outpaced its stellar stock gains. Nvidia is trading at 39 times expected earnings, making it less expensive on that basis than a year ago, when it traded at over 70 times expected earnings, LSEG data showed.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich in Oaklnad, Calif.; Additional reporting by Sinead Carew in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Richard Chang)\n"

        "Title": "After Nvidia's Stock Split and 150% First-Half Gain, Will It Soar in the Second Half? Here's What History Says.",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has probably been the most watched stock on the planet over the past several months. This is because the company dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, and its soaring revenue has prompted the stock to skyrocket. In the first half, the shares soared more than 150% -- and that's after already gaining more than 1,300% in the previous five years.\nIn fact, this momentum pushed Nvidia stock past the threshold of $1,000, a level that may be a psychological barrier for some investors -- and in other cases makes it difficult for small investors to buy without relying on fractional shares. So Nvidia launched a stock split recently to bring down the price of each individual share. Investors welcomed the news, and the stock rallied nearly 30% from the split announcement through the actual operation.\nNow, though, the big question is whether Nvidia's momentum will continue post-split and whether this top chip designer will soar in the second half. Let's look to history for some answers.\nFirst, it's important to note that just because a certain pattern occurred in the past doesn't guarantee the same pattern will continue in the future. So, any conclusions we draw may guide us -- but they aren't set in stone. The market or a particular stock may surprise us.\nThat said, patterns do replicate frequently enough to make them worth our consideration. They may offer us an idea of what generally happens after a certain event, making us aware of likely possibilities.\nLet's move on to the idea of stock splits and what history shows. A stock split, through the issuance of new shares to current holders, lowers the price of each individual share -- but without changing the market value of the company or the valuation of the stock. So, the operation hasn't changed anything fundamental about the particular company or stock.\nBut the split accomplishes one major thing: It opens the investment opportunity up to a broader range of investors. This is positive for you and me because it makes it easier for us to invest in a company like Nvidia, and it's positive for the company because it offers it a whole new audience of potential investors. So it's a win-win situation. Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split brought the stock price down from more than $1,000 to about $125.\nStock splits in and of themselves, since they're just mechanical operations, aren't catalysts for stock performance -- you wouldn't buy a stock just because the company launched a split. But, as you can see in the chart, below, history shows that stock split players tend to outperform the S&P 500 in the 12 months following the stock split announcement.\nThe chart shows that stock split companies have generated an average total return of more than 25% in that 12-month period. That's compared to less than 12% for the S&P 500 as a whole. This is based on Bank of America's Research Investment Committee data from 1980 through today.\nNow we can dig deeper by looking at Nvidia itself after its past two stock splits, in 2007 and 2021. After both, the stock declined in the 12 months that followed -- but first, the shares advanced in the two to five months after the operation. Nvidia stock climbed more than 60% in the five months following the 2021 split and added about 17% in the six-week period following the 2007 split.\nSo, what does all of this tell us about what may happen today? It's important to keep in mind that Nvidia's business has greatly evolved since the past stock splits. Then, it mainly served the video gaming industry and progressively was moving into other areas, such as AI. Today, the high-growth field of AI is the company's main business, making the stock significantly more attractive to investors. So Nvidia may have stronger momentum today than it did after previous splits -- and that might make a lasting rally possible.\nThis can happen if Nvidia continues to report impressive earnings growth and deliver on product launch goals. And things look promising. Nvidia has reported quarter after quarter of record revenue and says demand for its soon-to-launch Blackwell architecture and chip surpasses supply. And speaking of Blackwell, this launch, too, could be a positive catalyst for the stock.\nAll of this means it's very possible Nvidia stock will soar in the second half, thanks to the company's leadership in a high-growth market and solid revenue prospects. And the best news is this: Even if history is wrong and Nvidia doesn't rally in the coming months, this top stock still has what it takes to deliver big returns to investors over the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "SMH ETF: Exposure to Nvidia and Other Top Chip Stocks",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "It\u2019s hard to look past Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) these days, but it\u2019s important to remember that there are also plenty of other great semiconductor (chip) stocks out there. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) enables investors to gain exposure to both Nvidia and other attractive opportunities within the semiconductor space.\nI\u2019m bullish on SMH based on its strong portfolio of top semiconductor stocks, which are performing well and harbor significant long-term growth potential, as well as its incredible track record of generating strong returns for its holders. We\u2019ve covered SMH previously; it has performed well since then and continues to look like a compelling opportunity for the long term.\nSMH is the largest dedicated semiconductor ETF.\u00a0According to sponsor VanEck, SMH invests in the\u00a0\u201cMVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index (MVSMHTR), which is intended to track the overall performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment.\u201d\nVanEck highlights the fact that these are highly liquid stocks, industry leaders, and companies with global scale.\nSMH owns 26 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 76.2% of the fund.\u00a0Below, you\u2019ll find an overview of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\nWhile the fund isn\u2019t particularly diversified, it gives investors substantial exposure to Nvidia (which has a large weighting of 24.6%) and other top semiconductor stocks, including Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and more.\nWere it not for Nvidia\u2019s 209.6% gain over the past year, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019d be hearing more about Broadcom and its 111.8% gain. But the semiconductor and software infrastructure giant is now knocking on the door of becoming one of the world\u2019s 10 largest companies and is worthy of plenty of attention on its own accord. The stock is a long-term winner that has generated an incredible total return of 3,168% over the past decade.\nIt\u2019s also an underrated dividend growth stock that has increased its dividend payout for 13 straight years and grown this payout at an impressive 17.5% CAGR over the past five years. Additionally, like Nvidia, Broadcom has a stock split of its own coming up.\nThe company recently announced that it will execute a 10-for-1 stock split, which will go live on July 12th. While stock splits don\u2019t necessarily make a fundamental difference, they can drive considerable interest and momentum in a stock, as we recently saw with Nvidia. They can also make the stock more accessible to smaller investors and retail investors.\nIn addition to Broadcom, Taiwan Semiconductor is another one of the many attractive chip stocks among SMH\u2019s top holdings.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world\u2019s largest and most advanced chipmaker. Leading semiconductor companies like the aforementioned Nvidia, Broadcom, Qualcomm, and others go to Taiwan Semiconductor to manufacture the cutting-edge chips that they design and develop. This makes Taiwan Semiconductor an attractive picks-and-shovels play within the semiconductor space. The $786.1 billion company has seen its stock gain a cool 75.2% over the past year and hit a new all-time high.\nNext, Qualcomm, which is up 93.8% over the past year, has made a name for itself, as the company is developing cutting-edge semiconductors for everything from smartphones to automobiles and Internet of Things devices.\nAdditional top 10 holdings, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), are among the few companies in the world providing the high-tech tools and equipment that are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process, making them crucial parts of the semiconductor value chain with wide moats (competitive advantages).\nOne thing that Broadcom, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Qualcomm all have in common is that they all feature \u201cPerfect 10\u201d Smart Scores. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. Seven of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above.\nAdditionally, SMH boasts an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8.\nSMH owns a strong collection of highly-rated semiconductor stocks, and it has also generated excellent returns for its holders for a long time, giving it a track record that\u2019s hard to beat.\nAs of May 31, SMH has delivered an enviable annualized three-year return of 25.5%. This stellar return easily trumps that of the broader market. The Vanguard S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:VOO) returned 9.6% on an annualized basis over the same time frame. It even beats the strong performance of the tech-focused Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK), which delivered an annualized return of 15.9% over the same time span.\nOver a longer five-year timeframe, SMH has generated a scorching annualized return of 38.6%. This number again handily beats the broader market and XLK (VOO returned an annualized 15.8% over the same time frame, while XLK returned an annualized 25.2%). Note that these are both great returns, and SMH still beat them by a considerable margin.\nEven going back 10 years, SMH has produced a phenomenal annualized return of 27.8%, again beating both the broader market and the tech-focused XLK. VOO returned an annualized 12.7% over the same time frame, while XLK returned an annualized 20.3%.\nSMH features a reasonable expense ratio of 0.35%, meaning that an investor in the fund will pay $35 on a $10,000 investment annually.\u00a0This isn\u2019t the lowest fee out there, as many broad market index funds charge lower fees. However, it is on par with its peers and reasonable enough for a sector-specific ETF, especially one that is performing as well as SMH.\nTurning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $285.18 implies 7.5% upside potential from current levels.\nIn conclusion, I\u2019m bullish on SMH because it provides investors substantial exposure to Nvidia and top semiconductor stocks like Broadcom, Taiwan Semiconductor, and others. Plus, its phenomenal returns over the past three, five, and 10 years give it an unassailable track record.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "Aside from artificial intelligence (AI), companies enacting stock splits are the hottest thing on Wall Street.\nA stock split allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count while having no impact on its market cap or operating performance. In particular, investors have focused their attention on high-flying stocks with clear-cut competitive advantages that are conducting forward stock splits and making their shares more affordable for everyday investors.\nThe latest high-profile stock-split stock is none other than AI-titan Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). However, the company's recent 10-for-1 forward split wasn't its first.\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in January 1999, Nvidia has undergone six forward splits:\nJune 2000: 2-for-1 stock split\nSeptember 2001: 2-for-1\nApril 2006: 2-for-1\nSeptember 2007: 3-for-2\nJuly 2021: 4-for-1\nJune 2024: 10-for-1\nIf you owned one share of Nvidia stock at its IPO in January 1999, you'd now hold 480 shares following its latest stock split. That's an increase in market value from $12 at its 1999 IPO to $62,870 in present-day value.\nNvidia's recipe to success is its in-demand H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the standard in high-compute data centers. Nvidia's top four customers are all members of the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nWith AI-GPU demand heavily outpacing supply, the company has had no trouble increasing its prices and boosting its margins.\nBut becoming Wall Street's latest stock-split stock may not be enough to propel Nvidia's shares higher. History hasn't been kind to next-big-thing innovations. Investors have overestimated the adoption of every new technology for three decades, and AI is unlikely to break that trend.\nNvidia is facing competition from within. Its top customers are all developing their own AI-accelerating chips, which is a clear signal that America's most influential businesses aim to reduce their reliance on AI's top dog.\nThe sledding is likely to get tougher for Nvidia going forward.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adrian Volenik ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has seen incredible growth in recent years. Since the beginning of 2024, the company\u2019s stock has jumped 167%. Over the past five years, it has surged by an impressive 3,450%.\nGiven these figures, it\u2019s easy to see why many NVIDIA employees who joined the company five or more years ago are likely millionaires today. Additionally, many midlevel managers at NVIDIA reportedly make over $1 million a year, thanks to stock options and the overall appreciation of the company's stock.\nHowever, being flush with cash now means that many established Nvidia executives are reportedly operating in \"semiretirement\" mode, which caught the attention of CEO Jensen Huang. They are financially comfortable enough that they don\u2019t seem motivated to work as hard as they used to.\nDon't Miss:\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare?\nThis Uber-for-moving startup is quietly taking the world by storm, here\u2019s how anyone can invest with $100.\nIn response to questions about \u2018semiretired' employees, Huang advised all workers to act as the \u2018CEO' of their own time and be responsible for determining their work ethic. Still, even Huang received a 60% pay boost last fiscal year, and his compensation reached $34.2 million as Nvidia\u2019s market value is now $3.2 trillion.\nBut not all Nvidia employees think they\u2019re rich. As one Nvidia engineer earning $250,000 a year shared with Business Insider, employee salaries at the company are only impressive at first glance. He explained that although some Nvidia employees might be lucky enough to become millionaires, \"a million doesn\u2019t go too far.\"\nThis engineer, based on the West Coast and having joined Nvidia a few years ago, receives almost half of his base salary in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) annually. He pointed out that from an outsider's perspective, it might seem like all Nvidia employees are rolling in money, especially with the company\u2019s stock skyrocketing.\nTrending: A startup that turns videos into games gets backing from Mark Cuban and opens a round for regular investors at $250.\nHowever, he clarified that not everyone receives a large number of RSUs as there's a limit on how many stock units employees can get. Even the top performers are capped at receiving 50% of their base salary in stock each year.\n\"You will end up cashing your stocks to meet your annual obligations in terms of personal taxes, property taxes, and any other expenses you will have,\" he said.\nAs former Tesla director of AI Andrej Karpathy recently pointed out, \"Most people don't HODL, and the government takes half.\" In other words, many Nvidia and Tesla employees could have been millionaires if they hadn\u2019t sold their company stock when they immediately could. On the other hand, he added that long-term holders are likely awaiting Tesla to achieve fully autonomous driving with its FSD software before they sell at a premium.\nKeep Reading:\nExecutives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can coinvest in at $1.15 per share.\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Employees Who Joined Nvidia 5 Years Ago Now Millionaires And Coasting In 'Semi-Retirement' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Author": "  John Kruzel ",
        "Text": "By John Kruzel\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear a bid by Nvidia to scuttle a securities fraud lawsuit accusing the artificial intelligence chipmaker of misleading investors about how much of its sales went to the volatile cryptocurrency industry.\nThe justices took up Nvidia's appeal made after a lower court revived a proposed class action brought by shareholders in California against the company and its CEO Jensen Huang. The suit, led by the Stockholm, Sweden-based investment management firm E. Ohman J:or Fonder AB, seeks unspecified monetary damages.\nSanta Clara, California-based Nvidia is a high-flying company that has become one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, and its market value has surged.\nIn 2018, Nvidia's chips became popular for cryptomining, a process that involves performing complex math equations in order to secure cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\nThe plaintiffs in a 2018 lawsuit accused Nvidia and top company officials of violating a U.S. law called the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making statements in 2017 and 2018 that falsely downplayed how much of Nvidia's revenue growth came from crypto-related purchases.\nThose omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of cryptomining on Nvidia's business, the plaintiffs said.\nU.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. dismissed the lawsuit in 2021 but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 ruling subsequently revived it. The 9th Circuit found that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged that Huang made \"false or misleading statements and did so knowingly or recklessly,\" allowing their case to proceed.\nNvidia urged the justices to take up its appeal, arguing that the 9th Circuit's ruling would open the door to \"abusive and speculative litigation.\"\nNvidia in 2022 agreed to pay $5.5 million to U.S. authorities to settle charges that it did not properly disclose the impact of cryptomining on its gaming business.\nThe justices agreed on June 10 to hear a similar bid by Meta's Facebook to dismiss a private securities fraud lawsuit accusing the social media platform of misleading investors in 2017 and 2018 about the misuse of its user data by the company and third parties. Facebook appealed after a lower court allowed a shareholder lawsuit led by Amalgamated Bank to proceed.\nThe Supreme Court will hear the Nvidia and Facebook cases in its next term, which begins in October.\n(Reporting by John Kruzel; Editing by Will Dunham)\n"

The Dow enjoyed its second-straight session up at the close, +56 points or +0.15%, while the S&P 500 rose +0.25%, the index\u2019s 31st record-high close this year so far.\nThe small-cap Russell 2000 split the difference today, +0.19%, while the Nasdaq \u2014 still leading all indices for the week, month, year to date and last year \u2014 gained a scant +5 points, +0.03%. This can be attributed directly to NVIDIA\u2019s NVDA +3.5% increase today. NVIDIA literally tipped the Nasdaq into the green, and a fresh all-time closing high to 17,862.Further, NVIDIA once again surpassed Microsoft MSFT in market cap today, reaching a level of $3.34 trillion and making it the most valuable company in the world at present. The GPU innovator and leader in A.I. data center business added today\u2019s +3.5% to +45% growth in just the past four weeks, +181% year to date and +209% over the past year. As the company\u2019s forecasts continue to be written higher and higher, NVIDIA still carried a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).During the course of today\u2019s session, we saw a couple economic reports. Business Inventories for April came in-line with expectations at +0.3%, from an unrevised -0.1% reported the previous month. Meanwhile the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) made its forecast for 2024 and beyond: -$1.9 trillion for this year, -$2.0 trillion for 2025 and looking out to 2034 at -$2.8T. Big numbers though these clearly are, it\u2019s interesting to think that NVIDIA could cover them all by itself.After today\u2019s close, KB Home KBH is out with fiscal Q2 results. Earnings of $2.50 per share easily surpassed the $1.78 in the Zacks consensus, and swinging to a positive year over year from $1.94 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $1.71 billion nicely outshone the consensus $1.64 billion expected. Its average selling price for a new home reached $483K, higher than the $479.5K reported a year ago. Net orders were up +2% year over year, but Deliveries were -4% in the quarter, with earnings and sales guidance to be discussed on the conference call.We\u2019ll take a break from trading tomorrow, in observance of the Juneteenth holiday. When we return on Thursday, new Jobless Claims will be joined by Housing Starts and Permits, Philly Fed manufacturing and the Q2 U.S. Current Account, which is expected to tip to a deeper deficit into the -$200 billions. On Friday, PMI prints on Manufacturing and Services join Existing Home Sales and Leading Economic Indicators to close out the week.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Hardware Stocks According to Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other hardware stocks.\nWith the first half of 2024 nearly over, artificial intelligence continues to play a dominant role in the stock market. Stocks that either design semiconductors that are used for AI applications, or those that use them to either streamline their internal operations such as coding or offer products to customers have also made significant gains. These show the optimism in Wall Street for accelerated computing technologies, which are collectively called artificial intelligence.\nIn fact, the impact of AI has been so strong that not only has it upended the status quo of the most valuable firms in terms of market capitalization, but it also allowed some of the top AI companies to post triple digit percentage share price returns over the course of the past twelve months. Some of the top performing AI stocks are up by 213% over the past twelve months and have appreciated by 773% since November 2022. Back then, the stock market was whimpering in the aftermath of rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which had hit technology stocks particularly hard since they benefit from a fast growth and low rate environment.\nHowever, AI's impact on the stock market has fueled the triple digit percentage gains in some stocks since then. At the same time, it has also meant that major indexes continue to demonstrate robust performance that is fueled by the share price performance of mega cap technology stocks.\nIn 2024, the market has moved forward from investing in AI companies that can change the world with their hardware or software to evaluating whether these firms are delivering. The first quarter of the 2024 earnings season was the clearest example of this phenomenon, and it saw Wall Street take an unforgiving approach to large and small firms that presented even the slightest hint of being unable to either grow their revenues by targeting AI or control the costs of investing in the new technologies.\nWithin the AI industry, there are different categories of firms. Most of these, such as OpenAI, operate on the software side. This industry subsegment develops applications such as chat bots and other assistants along with expanding the use of AI to existing software such as image editing tools. AI hardware companies power these applications, and when compared to the software firms, not only do they command stable valuations, but they also see investors take comfort in the fact that the demand for their products is far more stable and predictable when compared to software demand. Recently Goldman Sachs published a bullish report on hardware stocks due to AI, which we covered in 15 Best Hardware Stocks According To Goldman. In this article we are going to approach the same theme from a different angle and there are vast differences between both rankings of hardware stocks.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the top hedge fund hardware stock picks, we ranked personal computing, semiconductor, and computer hardware by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024. Out of these, the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were selected. Basically our article listed the best hardware stocks to buy according to the 900+ equity hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 186\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the unsurprising leader of our list of the best AI hardware stocks. The firm is showing no signs of slowing down, as it announced its next generation AI chips for 2026 in June 2024 at Computex in Taiwan. The resulting stock market frenzy saw NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) cross Apple in market valuation, but this was short lived, as a report next day outlined that the US government is investigating NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft, and OpenAI for anti trust violations. This could prove to be a significant headwind to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), but as of now, the shares are rated Strong Buy on average and the average analyst share price target is $1,208.\nFor their first quarter of 2024 investments, 186 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stakeholders. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners owned the most valuable stake that was worth $12 billion.\nLooking toward the future, the expected annual and five year revenue growth rate for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is currently 32.6% and 46.53%. The forward P/E is 46.73, which implies that the firm can outpace the broader market in growth. Baron Funds commented on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s \"disruptive\" potential in its Q1 2024 investor letter where it shared:\nWe believe we are in the early stages of a multi-decade disruption. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA\u2019s co-founder, president, and CEO suggested at the conference that similar to how in the industrial revolution, raw materials came into the plant and final products came out, in the GenAI era, companies would become AI factories with data as a raw material and tokens as the output. Tokens can represent words, images, videos, or controls of a robot. Over time, as models continue to improve, and the cost of running them declines, an increasing number of human tasks could be augmented or replaced entirely by AI. We expect decision making to become much more data-driven, enabled by AI, as consumers, corporations, and governments alike, take advantage of the vast amounts of unstructured data we generate, which is estimated to represent 90% of all data generated.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best hardware stocks to buy. You can visit 15 Best Hardware Stocks According to Hedge Funds to see the other hardware stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA\u00a0and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Nvidia (NVDA). Shares have added about 26% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Nvidia due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\nNVIDIA reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings of $6.12 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.48% and increased 19% sequentially. Notably, NVDA posted earnings of $1.09 per share in the year-ago quarter.\nRevenues jumped 262% year over year to $26.04 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.02%. On a sequential basis, revenues increased 18%.\nNVIDIA is riding on a strong and innovative portfolio, with the growing adoption of its GPUs. It benefits from a strong partner base that includes the likes of TSMC, Synopsys, AWS, Alphabet, Microsoft, Oracle, and Johnson & Johnson MedTech.\nNVIDIA also announced a ten-for-one forward stock split of its issued common stock and raised the quarterly cash dividend by 150%.\nNVIDIA reports revenues under two segments \u2014 Graphics, and Compute & Networking.\nGraphics accounted for 13% of fiscal first-quarter revenues. The segment\u2019s top line climbed 23.3% year over year, while decreasing 20% sequentially to $3.37 billion. The figure lagged the consensus mark by 32.51%.\nCompute & Networking represented 87% of fiscal first-quarter revenues. Revenues soared 408.4% year over year and 27% sequentially to $22.68 billion. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.26%\nBased on the market platform, Gaming revenues increased 478% year over year but declined 8% sequentially at $2.65 billion beating the Zacks Consensus estimate by 0.72%.\nNVIDIA expanded its collaboration with Alphabet by offering support for Google\u2019s Gemma for ChatRTX, which brings chatbot capabilities to RTX-powered Windows PCs and workstations.\nRevenues from Data Center jumped 427% year over year and 23% sequentially to $22.56 billion. The figure beat the consensus mark by 9.09%.\nData Center compute revenues were $19.4 billion, up 478% year over year and 29% sequentially. Higher shipments of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform used for training and inferencing with large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications benefited top-line growth.\nNetworking revenues were $3.2 billion, up 242% year over year on strong growth of InfiniBand end-to-end solutions. However, revenues declined 5% sequentially due to the timing of supply.\nStrong sequential Data Center growth was driven by all customer types, led by Enterprise and Consumer Internet companies. Large cloud providers continued to drive strong growth as they deployed and ramped NVIDIA AI infrastructure at scale, representing mid-40% of NVIDIA\u2019s Data Center revenues.\nIn the reported quarter, NVDA announced that TSMC and Synopsys would go into production with NVIDIA cuLitho to accelerate computational lithography. It also expanded collaborations with AWS, Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud, Microsoft and Oracle to accelerate generative AI innovation.\nProfessional Visualization revenues increased 45% year over year but declined 8% sequentially to $427 million, lagging the Zacks Consensus estimate by 13.33%.\nAutomotive sales in the reported quarter totaled $329 million, up 11% on a year-over-year basis and 17% sequentially. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.78%.\nNVIDIA Drive Thor solution was adopted by BYD, XPENG, GAC\u2019s AION Hyper, Nuro and others in the reported quarter. Lucid and IM Motors are using the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin platform for vehicle models targeting the European market.\nOEM and Other revenues moved up 1% year over year but declined 13% sequentially to $78 million. The figure missed the consensus mark by 15.39%.\nIn the fiscal first quarter, NVIDIA launched the Blackwell platform targeted for AI computing at a trillion-parameter scale and the Blackwell-powered DGX SuperPOD for Generative AI supercomputing.\nIt announced NVIDIA Quantum and NVIDIA Spectrum X800 series switches for InfiniBand and Ethernet, respectively, optimized for trillion-parameter GPU computing and AI infrastructure.\nMoreover, the company launched NVIDIA AI Enterprise 5.0 with NVIDIA NIM inference microservices to speed enterprise app development.\nFor the gaming domain, NVIDIA launched AI gaming technologies for NVIDIA ACE and Neural Graphics. Moreover, it unveiled AI performance optimizations and integrations for Windows to deliver maximum performance on NVIDIA GeForce RTX AI PCs and workstations.\nFor the Professional Visualization domain, it launched NVIDIA RTX 500 and 1000 professional Ada generation laptop GPUs for AI-enhanced workflows, NVIDIA RTX A400 and A1000 GPUs for desktop workstations and NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud APIs.\nNVIDIA\u2019s non-GAAP gross margin increased to 78.9% from 66.8% in the year-ago quarter and 76.7% from the previous quarter, mainly driven by higher Data Center sales.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses increased 43% year over year and 13.2% sequentially to $2.50 billion. The increase was due to higher compensations and related benefits.\nHowever, as a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses declined to 9.6% from 24.3% in the year-ago quarter and 30.7% in the previous quarter.\nThe non-GAAP operating income was $18.06 billion compared with $3.05 billion in the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, the figure jumped 22.4%.\nAs of Apr 28, 2024, NVDA\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $31.44 billion, up from $25.98 billion as of Jan 28, 2024.\nAs of Apr 28, 2024, the total long-term debt was $8.46 billion, unchanged sequentially.\nNVIDIA generated $15.4 billion in operating cash flow, up from the previous quarter\u2019s $11.5 billion.\nThe company ended the fiscal first quarter with a free cash flow of $14.94 billion.\nIn the fiscal first quarter, it returned $7.8 billion to shareholders through dividend payouts and share repurchases.\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2025, NVIDIA anticipates revenues of $28 billion (+/-2%), higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.24 billion.\nThe non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 75.5% (+/-50 bps). Non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated at $2.8 billion.\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.\nThe consensus estimate has shifted 8.42% due to these changes.\nVGM Scores\nAt this time, Nvidia has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Nvidia has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "Title": "NVIDIA Overtakes Apple: ETFs to Tap the Incredible Growth Story",
        "Author": "  Sweta Killa ",
        "Text": "NVIDIA NVDA has been on an explosive surge with no signs of a slowdown, fueled by the artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy and blockbuster earnings. The chipmaker overtook Apple AAPL, topping $3 trillion in market cap and becoming the second-most valuable company in the United States. NVIDIA hit the $1 trillion mark in May 2023 and reached $2 trillion by February 2024, surpassing Amazon and Alphabet.Investors can tap into its incredible growth with the help of ETFs that have the largest allocation to this AI darling. These include Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, AXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF WUGI, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, Grizzle Growth ETF DARP and TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF LRNZ. All these funds have NVIDIA as the top holding with a large concentration.The latest catalyst in driving the growth is the stock split and the fervor surrounding the next-generation AI chips. The solid trend is likely to continue.NVIDIA sparked a retail frenzy on the 10-for-1 stock split news. At the end of the week, NVDA will undergo a 10-for-1 stock split, which will make its shares more affordable to a wider range of investors, including the ones who make small trades, and increase liquidity. In a stock split, the company increases the number of shares, reducing the share price. However, the total dollar value of all shares outstanding remains the same and doesn\u2019t affect the company\u2019s valuation (read: ETFs to Tap on NVIDIA's 10-for-1 Stock Split Retail Frenzy).The stock split will also likely pave the way for NVIDIA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, like Amazon (AMZN), which joined the index earlier this year after undergoing a 20-for-1 stock split in June 2022.NVIDIA has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom. Last weekend, the AI chipmaker unveiled a high-powered version of its Blackwell chip \u2014 called the Blackwell Ultra \u2014 slated to release in 2025, followed by a new AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026. The company will debut an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027. Its first Blackwell processors are slated for delivery later this year, replacing the widely popular Hopper generative AI chips.Companies like Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Alphabet are rapidly expanding their AI computing capabilities, boosting NVIDIA's growth. NVIDIA has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, which are attracting billions of dollars in spending from big cloud vendors.Further, Elon Musk recently announced that AI start-up xAI's supercomputer will run on NVIDIA technology. This week, Foxconn announced its plans to build an advanced computing center in Taiwan using NVIDIA's Blackwell chips. These are expected to provide a further boost to the company\u2019s growth prospects.\nWall Street analysts are going more bullish on NVIDIA and continue to boost their price targets. This week, Bank of America called NVIDIA a \"top pick,\" reiterating its buy rating on the stock and raising its price target to $1,500 from $1,320. As the chipmaker is accelerating its product upgrade cycle, the analyst believes the move will \"continue to bolster NVIDIA\u2019s AI leadership position.\"Driven by explosive growth prospects, Wall Street analysts have turned more bullish on NVIDIA and raised the target price on the stock post-earnings. At least 28 of the 58 brokerage firms have raised their price targets on the stock, pushing up the median view to $1,200, according to the recent LSEG data.NVIDIA currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.20 a month ago based on 40 recommendations.Of the 41 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 87.8% and 4.88% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 87.5%, while Buy represented 5%.\nNVIDIA stock has risen more than 140% this year and 200% over the past year. It is by far the biggest outperformer among the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d However, its valuation does not seem overstretched, given that its earnings are growing faster than the share price. NVIDIA is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 42.85 versus 47.81 for Advanced Micro Devices AMD (read: AMD-Nvidia ETFs in Focus Amid New Chip Introductions).\nStrive U.S. Semiconductor ETF (SHOC)Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF seeks broad market exposure to the U.S. semiconductor sector. It follows the Bloomberg US Listed Semiconductors Select Total Return Index and holds 32 stocks in its basket, with NVIDIA accounting for 31.9% of the assets. Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF has AUM of $71.4 million and charges 40 bps in annual fees. It trades in a volume of 13,000 shares per day on average and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy).AXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF (WUGI)AXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF is an actively managed ETF that invests in stocks of companies that benefit from the ever-evolving digital economy. It holds 31 stocks in the basket, with NVIDIA making up for a 26.1% share. AXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF has accumulated $29.5 million in its asset base and charges 75 bps in fees per year. It trades in a volume of 32,000 shares a day on average.VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF offers exposure to companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment. It follows the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index and holds 26 stocks in its basket, with NVIDIA accounting for 24.5% of the total assets. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF has managed assets worth $20.5 billion and charges 35 bps in annual fees and expenses. SMH has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a High risk outlook.Grizzle Growth ETF (DARP)Grizzle Growth ETF is an actively managed ETF that seeks long-term capital appreciation through companies focused on growth, innovation and disruption. It seeks to identify future leaders in key growth themes, including Digitization and Cloud Computing, Future Media and Entertainment, Health and Wellness, and Sustainability and Energy Transition.

        "Title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia 10 Years From Now",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "We can probably all agree that the world will look different in 2034. However, much will likely remain more or less the same as it is today.\nFor example, I expect Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) will still be one of the world's biggest and most influential companies. Despite my optimism about the AI chip leader, though, I don't think it will be the biggest company in the world. I predict these three stocks will be worth more than Nvidia 10 years from now.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) ranked as the world's largest company based on market cap throughout most of the last decade. It lost the top spot for a while and even fell into third place behind Nvidia for a brief period. However, Apple is again neck and neck in vying for the No. 1 position. I predict it will firmly hold this perch in 2034.\nYou might say Apple was a sleeping giant for a while with generative AI. The company didn't jump on the bandwagon like several other technology leaders did after OpenAI released its wildly popular ChatGPT. That's no longer the case.\nSome viewed Apple's new AI functionality that was revealed at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) earlier this week as underwhelming. On the other hand, many investors seemed to see Apple Intelligence (the name the company gave to its generative AI products and services) as a likely catalyst for a new iPhone upgrade super cycle.\nOne thing is certain: Apple is no longer asleep at the wheel with anything AI-related. I fully expect that the company will dominate edge AI (running AI on devices rather than in the cloud). I would also bet that its services business will continue to grow rapidly.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has gone back and forth with Apple as the world's largest company. Although I don't think Microsoft will ultimately hang on to the top spot, I expect the company to remain larger than Nvidia 10 years from now.\nProbably the biggest reason for my prediction about Microsoft is its relationship with OpenAI. The huge tech company's impressive gains since early last year have been largely due to its integration of OpenAI's large language model (LLM) throughout its product lineup. I expect OpenAI to remain one of the leading innovators in AI. As a result, I think Microsoft will continue to profit from its relationship with the AI pioneer.\nI also look for Microsoft's cloud unit to have more sources for AI chips in the future, including its own custom silicon. If I'm right, this should boost the company's profitability as the laws of supply and demand work their magic on lowering chip prices. As Microsoft's earnings go, so go its stock price and market cap -- at least over the long term. In addition, increased competition could prevent Nvidia from dethroning Microsoft and Apple.\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) market cap lags well behind Nvidia's right now. Since I've included the stock on this list, I obviously anticipate that will change. Why?\nFor one thing, Alphabet's Google DeepMind rivals OpenAI. I think the two leaders will remain neck and neck in advancing AI over the coming years. While some see AI as an existential threat to Google Search, I predict Alphabet will be successful in blending search with generative AI. Its Google Cloud business should also benefit from new sources of AI chips, just as Microsoft will.\nI like the prospects for Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car unit. By 2034, Waymo could be a significant growth driver for the company with the rising adoption of robotaxis.\nAlphabet could also achieve major breakthroughs in quantum computing over the next 10 years. Google Quantum Computing believes it could achieve its goal of developing a \"useful, error-corrected quantum computer\" within this decade.\nThis could make Alphabet an even more formidable player in AI because of the ability of quantum computers to process data much faster than traditional computers.\nAlthough I predict Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet will be bigger than Nvidia 10 years from now, I wouldn't count Nvidia out. My assumption is that other chipmakers will be in a better position to challenge it over the coming years. If the company continues to out-innovate all of its rivals, though, that might not happen.\nI think Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet are great stocks for long-term investors. But Nvidia is, too.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "For more than a decade, with only a few interruptions, Apple held the title of the world's most valuable company, becoming the first to top $3 trillion in market capitalization \u2014 mostly due to the iPhone, a device millions of investors use daily.\nRecently, Apple was overtaken by Microsoft, and this week there was briefly a new king of Wall Street \u2014 once again a Bay Area company: Nvidia, which makes semiconductors in high demand for artificial intelligence applications. It's the hottest stock around and the company has a market cap that tops $3.2 trillion.\nRead more: California lawmakers are trying to regulate AI before it's too late. Here's how \nHere's what to know about the world's leading AI chipmaker:\nWhat role is Nvidia playing in the artificial intelligence industry?\nArtificial intelligence programs are complex computer applications that rely on massive databases and processing power to produce their results. OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, a much-talked about program released last year that generates text, is estimated to have 1.7 trillion \"parameters,\" or variables, about 10 times more than its 2020 predecessor \u2014 and the complexity is only growing. Nvidia makes a chip called the H100 accelerator that is able to process that data and is in high demand. This month it announced it is making an even more advanced chip.\nHas Nvidia always made chips for artificial intelligence?\nNvidia went public in 1999 and for years was seen largely as a manufacturer of premium graphics cards sought after by gamers for their clarity in rendering high-speed visuals. The cards don't come cheap, with Nvidia's top-of-the-line GeForce RTX 4090 currently retailing around $1,700. But given its niche position in the industry, Nvidia stock lingered for years under $1 per share, adjusted for stock splits.\nWhen did its fortunes improve?\nDuring last decade's crypto boom, its powerful chips were sought by \"miners\" of bitcoin, which employ computer banks to solve puzzles that reward them with cryptocurrency. The demand was so strong Nvidia launched a new chip specifically for miners as its stock surged from 87 cents in May 2016 to more than $7 in October 2018 \u2014 before the crypto bubble burst and shares fell under $4.\nThe fall prompted a shareholder lawsuit over accusations that the company hid how much revenue it was making on crypto-related sales. That suit is currently before the Supreme Court.\nWhat happened after the collapse of the crypto boom?\nNvidia enjoyed a resurgence during the pandemic as Americans confined at home turned to their gaming computers. Its annual revenue shot up more than 50% to $16.7 billion in the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2021. The company's cloud computing platform also grew as customers relied on the networks to handle the shift to remote work. Nvidia's stock topped $19 a share in August 2022 before coming back to earth and trading below $12 later in the year as the pandemic waned.\nRead more: AI companies are courting Hollywood. Do they come in peace? \nWhen did the current stock surge begin?\nNvidia shares have been on a steady upswing since 2021 as the hype over artificial intelligence has become a frenzy \u2014 supported by the company's strong sales growth. Nvidia's revenue hit $60.9 billion in its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2024. Shares started the year at $48.17 and closed Tuesday at $135.58, a 180% gain that gave it a market value of about $3.34 trillion, briefly surpassing Microsoft.\nCan the company keep it up?\nNvidia reported record fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $26 billion, up 262% from a year earlier, as demand for its chips grew beyond cloud-service providers to include consumer internet companies, governments and automotive and healthcare customers. The company's revenue is projected to grow 44% annually in the near future, according to a FactSet survey of 60 analysts.\nWhat other companies are benefiting from AI?\nMicrosoft has seen its own stock gain about 20% this year. That's largely due to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft's Bing browser now offers a chat function powered by Chat GPT-4 that can write emails and perform other tasks. Apple stock also hit a record high this week after it announced its Apple Intelligence platform, which will be integrated into its iPhone, iPad, and Mac lineups.\nIs a lot of this just hype like crypto?\nMany on Wall Street believe that artificial intelligence is in a different league than blockchain and cryptocurrency, with far more concrete applications. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel Corp. are rolling out new chips to counter Nvidia's market dominance.\nHowever, there are dissenting voices. Rob Arnott, founder of Newport Beach investment company Research Affiliates, has called Nvidia a great company but warned even last year that its stock performance is unsustainable.\n\u201cOverconfident markets paradoxically transform brilliant future business prospects into even more brilliant current stock price levels,\u201d Arnott wrote in a research note. \u201cNvidia is today\u2019s exemplar of that genre: a great company priced beyond perfection.\u201d\nBloomberg News contributed to this report.\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights. \nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.NVIDIA\u2019s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company\u2019s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.NVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company\u2019s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company\u2019s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.Santa Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024, up 126% from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023.Beginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments \u2013 Graphics and Compute & Networking.Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.Compute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.Graphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 22% and 78% of fiscal 2024 revenues, respectively.\nBottom Line\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Nvidia ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nA $1000 investment made in June 2014 would be worth $249,298.97, or a 24,829.90% gain, as of June 12, 2024, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 176.52% and gold's return of 74.62% over the same time frame.\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for NVDA.\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. Shares of the company have outperformed the industry over the past year. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\nShares have gained 32.35% over the past four weeks and there have been 15 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The artificial intelligence boom in the last year helped the chipmaker claim the second spot. It now sits behind only Microsoft.\nThe company\u2019s market cap climbed over the $3 trillion mark for the first time, which put it over the iPhone manufacturer. At Wednesday\u2019s stock market close, Nvidia stood at $3.019 trillion while Apple was at $2.99 trillion. Microsoft stood above both at $3.15 trillion.\nNvidia is the current belle of the corporate ball. They brought in $14.9 billion net income last quarter on a revenue of $26 billion. Since their first quarter earnings report in May, their stock shot up a staggering 24%.\nCompare this to 2022, when Nvidia\u2019s net income sat at $0.7 billion in the last quarter.

        "Author": "  Max A. Cherney and Arsheeya  Bajwa ",
        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney and Arsheeya Bajwa\nTAIPEI (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices unveiled its latest artificial intelligence processors on Monday and detailed its plan to develop AI chips over the next two years in a bid to challenge industry leader Nvidia.\nAt the Computex technology trade show in Taipei, AMD CEO Lisa Su introduced the MI325X accelerator, which is set to be made available in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe race to develop generative artificial intelligence programs has led to towering demand for the advanced chips used in AI data centers able to support these complex applications.\nAMD has been vying to compete against Nvidia, which currently dominates the lucrative market for AI semiconductors and commands about 80% of its share.\nSince last year, Nvidia has made it clear to investors that it plans to shorten its release cycle to annually, and now AMD has followed suit.\n\"AI is clearly our number one priority as a company and we have really harnessed all of the development capability within the company to do that,\" Su told reporters.\n\"This annual cadence is something that is there because the market requires newer products and newer capabilities... Every year we have the next big thing such that we always have the most competitive portfolio.\"\nAMD also introduced an upcoming series of chips titled MI350, which is expected to be available in 2025 and will be based on new chip architecture.\nCompared to the currently available MI300 series of AI chips, AMD said it expects the MI350 to perform 35 times better in inference - the process of computing generative AI responses.\nAdditionally, AMD revealed the MI400 series, which will arrive in 2026 and will be based on an architecture called \"Next\".\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang had said on Sunday the company's next-generation AI chip platform called Rubin, set to be rolled out in 2026, would include GPUs, CPUs and networking chips.\nInvestors, who have poured billions of dollars into Wall Street's picks-and-shovels trade, have been seeking longer-term updates from chip firms to evaluate the longevity of the booming genAI rally, which so far has shown no signs of slowing down.\nAMD shares were flat, while Nvidia was up more than 3% on Monday. AMD has more than doubled in value since the start of 2023, but the surge pales in comparison to the more than seven-fold rise in Nvidia's shares in the same period.\n\"While the proof will be in the pudding, there's no doubt that AMD is taking Nvidia heads-on and companies looking for alternatives to Nvidia are bound to be happy to hear what AMD had to say,\" said Technalysis Research chief analyst Bob O'Donnell.\nAMD's Su said in April the company expects AI chip sales of roughly $4 billion for 2024, an increase of $500 million from its prior estimate.\nAt the Computex event, AMD said its latest generation of central processor units will likely be available in the second half of 2024.\nWhile businesses generally prioritize spending on AI chips in data centers, some of AMD's CPUs are used in conjunction with graphics processor units, though the ratio is skewed in favor of GPUs.\nAMD detailed architecture for its new neural processing units (NPUs), which are dedicated to handling on-device AI tasks in AI PCs.\nChipmakers have been banking on added AI capabilities to drive growth in the PC market as it emerges from a years-long slump.\nPC providers such as HP and Lenovo will release devices which include AMD's AI PC chips. AMD said its processors exceed Microsoft's Copilot+ PC requirements.\n(Reporting by Max A Cherney and Ben Blanchard in Taipei and Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Will Dunham, Rashmi Aich and Arun Koyyur)\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia stock forecast: After rising more than 200% in a year the chipmaker could be fabulously profitable, an AI leader\u2014and an extremely poor investment",
        "Author": "  Shawn Tully ",
        "Text": "By August of last year, Nvidia\u2019s stock was substantially overvalued by most metrics. Now? The problem has nearly tripled. Nvidia\u2019s market cap had risen threefold to more than $1.2 trillion since the start of 2023, to notch the biggest short-term valuation jump in the history of capital markets, a rampage that drove its P/E multiple, based on the past four quarters of GAAP earnings, to well over 100.\nBack in those early days last August, Fortune\u2019s analysis argued that to deliver its investors decent returns over the next seven years, Nvidia would need to raise its earnings at an annual rate of over 22%, a number that looked virtually impossible, given an inevitable shrinkage in its gigantic margins, and the onset of rivals bent on invading the most lucrative, and fastest-growing market in the tech universe. David Trainer, founder and CEO of research firm New Constructs and arguably the best mind on Wall Street for assessing companies\u2019 worth based on fundamentals, confirmed my view, stating: \u201cNvidia\u2019s valuation is ridiculous. It\u2019s facing the same curse as Tesla. But when Tesla got profitable, loads of competitors entered the EV space, cutting margins and slowing sales. The same will happen with Nvidia.\u201d\nFrom July of 2023, a month before that story ran, to early January of 2024, Nvidia\u2019s shares plateaued, hovering mainly between $46 and $49. Since profits kept rising, its multiple dropped below 60, still a huge number, but hinting that if the earnings trajectory remained on course, and the valuation fell or even flatlined, the feats required to reward shareholders could shrink from the virtually impossible to the highly challenging but plausible.\nBlockbuster earnings for its Q4 of FY 2024 (its fiscal year ended Jan. 31), announced on Feb. 21, ignited the first stage for a moonshot that\u2019s far outstripped the lightning run in the first half of last year. On May 22, CEO Jensen Huang added the booster rocket, unveiling Q1 profits of $14.9 billion, a 21% increase over the awesome numbers reported just three months earlier.\nHuang further cheered Wall Street by announcing a 10-for-one stock split for June, and a 150% increase in the dividend. Nvidia\u2019s next-gen GPU chip, Huang declared, will start generating revenues later this year, and \u201cis going to be terrific,\u201d its introduction marking \u201cthe next wave of growth.\u201d Analysts garlanded the results by gushing that that there\u2019s \u201cno match for Nvidia\u2019s products,\u201d and that buying its shares amounts to a \u201cno-brainer,\u201d lauding its Q1 performance as \u201cperfect.\u201d Typical of the overwhelmingly rosy reception: an assertion that the only sure things in life are \u201cdeath, taxes, and Nvidia beats on earnings.\u201d\nFrom early January through midday on June 12, Nvidia\u2019s value famously jumped by 160% to $3.10 trillion, as its shares surged from $48 to $125, adding an incredible $1.90 trillion in market cap, more than twice the dollar liftoff over the first six months last year. In other words, it was the second near-tripling in valuation in only 18 months. The stock\u2019s astounding run added 210% of the total valuation of Berkshire Hathaway. In 2024, Nvidia has leapfrogged Alphabet and Amazon to stand as the world\u2019s third most valuable company, trailing only Apple ($3.30 trillion) and Microsoft ($3.25 trillion).\nNvidia\u2019s never-before-witnessed stock sprint poses a big problem for its current investors in deciding whether to exit and bank the windfall, and folks and funds who ponder purchasing its shares at these prices. We don\u2019t know how Nvidia will perform in the future, but today\u2019s valuation sets in stone the metrics it must meet to reward shareholders. And the hurdles just got far, far bigger.\nIn both my analysis last August, and in my current model, I posit that Nvidia must garner returns of 10%, at minimum over the next seven years, to enrich shareholders, since it\u2019s a high-risk bet, especially following the astronomical gains over the past few months. We\u2019ll assume that almost all of the future increases will come in capital gains. Despite the big dividend increase, the yield remains minuscule. Nvidia has also made substantial stock repurchases of $27 billion in the past nine quarters, but they\u2019ve done nothing to raise its earnings per share or its price. \u201cFor all the big buybacks, the share count remains unchanged,\u201d says accounting expert Jack Ciesielski. \u201cNvidia\u2019s issuing a lot of shares in its stock plan for employees, and these repurchases are just offsets, so that it\u2019s treading water on the share count.\u201d\nAs of Q1 2024, Nvidia has garnered profits of $42.6 billion over the past four quarters. Hence, our model\u2014incorporating only modest returns\u2014demands that profits wax at 25% annually over a seven-year span. Of course, the biggest percentage gains would come in the earlier period. Still, my projections show that from mid-2030 to mid-2031, the profit increase over the previous 12 months would total around $30 billion. That\u2019s 40% of the all-in figure for Microsoft and Alphabet over their past two fiscal years.\nAchieving yearly gains of 10% doubles the stock price over our seven-year window. In the last story, when Nvidia\u2019s market cap stood at $1.2 trillion, I reckoned that to ring the bell, Nvidia needed to raise profits to $80 billion over the chosen time frame. (I have since made a few changes to the calculations.) So what\u2019s the required target today? Instead of reaching $2.4 trillion, Nvidia must now swell its valuation by mid-2031 to $6.2 trillion (twice its current $3.10 trillion cap). Let\u2019s posit that by then, its P/E falls to around the current Nasdaq average of 30, no small number historically, by the way, and a multiple that would forecast years of strong profit growth beyond 2031. So a bull\u2019s-eye requires amassing net GAAP profits of just over $200 billion seven years hence (the $6.2 trillion projected valuation divided by a P/E of 30).\nWhat are the chances Nvidia could clinch the $200 billion goal? Remote. Adjusted by the yearly inflation of 2.25% forecast by the 10-year Treasury break-even rate, $200 billion equates to $170 billion in today\u2019s dollars. That\u2019s 70% more than Apple earned in its past fiscal year, and double Microsoft\u2019s profits over the past four quarters. A major problem: Nvidia is booking unsustainably fat margins. In FY 2024, it collected almost 50 cents in net profit for every dollar in sales, and in Q1, the take rose to 57 cents. By contrast, as of their last fiscal years, Alphabet is at 24%, Apple 25%, and Microsoft 35%, while super-profitable software giants Oracle, SAP, and Qualcomm respectively registered 17%, 20%, and 21%.\nIt\u2019s the same story regarding revenues. A reasonable prediction lowers Nvidia\u2019s margins to the still-fantastic Microsoft level of 35% by 2031. In that case, we\u2019d zoom forward to $580 million in sales by the close of our seven-year window. That\u2019s half again what Apple collects on its iPhones, laptops, and sundry products, and almost twice Alphabet\u2019s revenues.\nPut simply, the stratospheric performance of Nvidia stock jacks an already elevated bar so high that it\u2019s nearly impossible for even this extraordinary pole-vaulter to clear.\nI consulted Trainer for an update on his take on Nvidia, now that its valuation has far more than doubled since he rated it radically overpriced last year. Trainer deploys cash flow projections models that show the heights earnings and revenues must register to \u201cdiscount back\u201d totaling the enterprise\u2019s market cap today. \u201cI ran the numbers at $100 a share,\u201d he says, noting that Nvidia\u2019s price is now 20% higher. \u201cTo be worth that number, Nvidia would need revenues of $3 trillion, the size of the GDP of India, the most populous country in the world, 15 years from now. Its profits would need to hit $1.1 trillion, over 10 times where Apple is today.\u201d\nFor Trainer, investors are awarding Nvidia such an inflated valuation \u201cby extrapolating the competitive advantage it has today in perpetuity.\u201d Margins the size of Nvidia\u2018s don\u2019t last long, he says. \u201cThat\u2019s analyst training 101,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnytime a competitor sees margins like that, they jump in and make big investments to grab part of your business. For now, Nvidia can do what no one else can do, but the best competitors will find a way. It will become a race to the bottom.\u201d Never has an enterprise inspired such widespread faith that it can transform the entire world economy. But the market\u2019s belief, and the crazy valuation it\u2019s created, has rendered reaching a golden destination for shareholders a bridge too far.\nLooking ahead, Nvidia may be destined for fabulous profitability, growth, and leadership in AI, and still prove an extremely poor investment.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\nNvidia, the Nasdaq and the S&P500 got dizzy at record highs on Thursday as world markets start to take stock of a bumper 2024 as we near the half-year point next week - but with the dollar back on the march regardless.\nThe latest U.S. economic readouts showing some cooling of activity through May and June, but the trigger for the megacap recoil was less than clear - not least with the Atlanta Federal Reserve's \"GDPNow\" real-time estimate still showing a brisk 3% growth for the quarter.\nThe scale of recent tech gains may just have been too fast as midyear accounting prompts a breather - and perhaps investors are now bracing for a bumpier second half into November's U.S. election. Next Thursday's presidential TV debate may sound the klaxon for that.\nEither way, Nvidia's 3.5% drop on the day meant it surrendered its brief role as the most valued company to Microsoft again and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended a seven-day streak of record closing highs.\nThe wider equity complex was more mixed, however, with the blue-chip Dow Jones gaining 0.7% and the small-cap Russell 2000 flat on the day.\nDespite another softening of Treasury yields after misses on housing starts and jobless claims, the dollar continued to build a head of steam.\nAnd greenback gains were pretty broad-based - against the European currencies where central bank rate cuts and easing bets are mounting, but also against Japan's yen and China's yuan in Asia. The DXY index touched its highest in almost two months.\nForeign money is exiting China again - amid rising global trade tensions and little sign of an end to the deepening housing bust there, Chinese stocks and the yuan had another poor end to a dour week.\nAbout 33 billion yuan ($4.54 billion) left the mainland this month via the Northbound leg of the Stock Connect Scheme - following four months of net inflows.\nWith one eye on the Chinese Communist Party's central committee plenum next month, G7 countries upping pressure on Chinese electric vehicle exports and Beijing considering retaliation, the yuan slipped to its weakest this year on Friday.\nChina's commerce ministry said on Friday the European Union has continued to escalate trade friction, which \"may trigger a trade war.\"\nJapan's yen is weakening rapidly again too - with doubts about the timing of Bank of Japan tightening reinforced by below-forecast inflation numbers that saw consumer price growth excluding energy and fresh food falling to just 2.1% last month.\nThat has sent dollar/yen back above 159 for the first time since late April, when the BoJ last intervened to cap it, and elicited another series of warnings from Japanese officials.\nWith the Swiss National Bank's second interest rate cut of the year on Thursday ringing in the background, the dollar climbed against European currencies too.\nSterling fell to its lowest level in over a month even after the Bank of England left its policy rates steady ahead of the July 4 UK election, as bets on an August rate cut there rose when the BoE indicated that its 7-2 policy-maker split in favour of holding the line was \"finely balanced\".\nNews of a rebound in British retail sales last month after a weather-related bust in April did little to shift the dial.\nAnd the euro sank back to the lows it hit last week on France's political upheaval, with June business surveys for the euro zone showing a sharper slowdown in activity there than forecast.\nThe currency bloc's services industry showed signs of weakening while a downturn in manufacturing took a turn for the worse.\nBack on Wall Street, equivalent S&P Global surveys for the United States are due out later on Friday.\nS&P500 futures were marginally in the red ahead of the bell.\nElsewhere, China imposed countermeasures on Lockheed Martin's relevant entities and senior executives on Friday over the United States' arms sales to Taiwan.\nAnd Britain's financial technology firm Revolut could be valued at north of $40 billion in a share sale, even as it still awaits a UK banking licence, according to people familiar with the situation.\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:\n* US Flash June business surveys from S&P Global, May existing home sales; Canada April retail sales\n* San Francisco President Federal Reserve President Mary Daly speaks\n* German Economy Minister Robert Habeck speaks in Beijing\n* ECOFIN meeting of European Union finance ministers in Luxembourg, with European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos attending\n* US corporate earnings: Carmax, Factset\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by Mark Heinrich mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n"

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Giant and Piling Into This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Instead",
        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "You might not realize it, but one of the most important data releases of the entire quarter occurred three weeks ago. During the heart of earnings season, and following the eagerly awaited April inflation report, institutions with $100 million in assets under management filed Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn simple terms, a 13F provides an over-the-shoulder snapshot of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful investors bought and sold in the most recent quarter. In this instance, it covered trading activity during the March-ended quarter. Even though these snapshots are backward looking, they can offer valuable insight into what stocks, industries, and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's top investors.\nOne theme that's definitely stood out for more than a year has been Wall Street's love for almost anything involved in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Using software and systems in place of humans, and giving these systems the ability to evolve over time without human intervention, provides AI with multitrillion-dollar utility in virtually all sectors and industries.\nBut what's interesting about this affinity for AI stocks is that the face of the AI revolution has been sent to the chopping block for two consecutive quarters by billionaire investors. At the same time, we've seen billionaires repeatedly pile into another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock with abundant long-term potential.\nAlthough artificial intelligence might be the hottest innovation since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, it didn't stop more than a half-dozen billionaire money managers from casting aside shares of the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement during the March-ended quarter. Eight billionaire investors -- nine if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- sent shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) packing, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares)\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares)\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares)\nStanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares)\nJohn Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares)\nDavid Tepper of Appaloosa Management (348,000 shares)\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares)\nThere's no denying that Nvidia has taken advantage of its AI-driven opportunity. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the preferred choice in high-compute data centers, and it's enjoying otherworldly pricing power on these chips as a result. Nvidia's gross margin came in at a scorching-hot 78.4% during its fiscal first quarter (ended April 28).\nNevertheless, there are four very clear reasons for billionaire investors to be skeptical of Nvidia moving forward.\nPerhaps the most obvious is that history has been unkind to next-big-thing innovations over the last three decades. Without fail, investors have overestimated the uptake/adoption of every new innovation, and AI is unlikely to break this trend. If the AI bubble bursts, the company that most-directly benefited from its rise (Nvidia) would be the likeliest to deflate.\nThe second issue is that Nvidia's pricing power on its GPUs is likely to wane in the quarters to come. Competitors are rolling out GPUs designed to train large language models and oversee generative AI solutions in AI-accelerated data centers. Even if Nvidia's H100 GPUs retain a compute edge over its competitors, the increased availability of new GPUs will lessen the scarcity that sent Nvidia's pricing power into the stratosphere. When this pricing power fades, so will Nvidia's gross margin.\nTight domestic regulation on AI solutions is another concern. In each of the last two years, U.S. regulators have restricted what AI chips Nvidia can export to China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. Nvidia even developed toned-down AI-GPUs (the A800 and H800) specifically for China following the first round of export restrictions in 2022, only to have these chips also banned for export to China last year. Sans China, Nvidia is missing out on billions of dollars in potential quarterly revenue.\nThe fourth and final puzzle piece that may have encouraged billionaires to ring the register is an increasing amount of internal competition. Nvidia's top four customers account for roughly 40% of its net sales. The problem is that they're all developing in-house AI-GPUs of their own. Regardless of whether these internally developed chips are to complement Nvidia's H100 GPUs or to replace them entirely, we're likely witnessing a peak in orders from these industry-leading businesses.\nSince the curtain opened on 2023, the Magnificent Seven stocks have been widely credited with sending Wall Street's major stocks indexes to record-closing highs. The Magnificent Seven are some of the largest (by market cap) and most-influential businesses in the country and are comprised of:\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nNvidia\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese seven companies are industry leaders with well-defined long-term catalysts and clear competitive edges. In fact, the four top customers of Nvidia I alluded to earlier are Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet.\nBut these are also stocks that billionaires have been avid sellers of in recent quarters... with one exception: e-commerce behemoth Amazon. During the first quarter, nine billionaires piled into Amazon stock, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,390,755 shares)\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (1,972,702 shares)\nChase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,438,600 shares)\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,336,042 shares)\nRay Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,047,891 shares)\nDan Loeb of Third Point (900,000 shares)\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (785,018 shares)\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (352,453 shares)\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (241,514 shares)\nYou'll note that three of the biggest sellers of Nvidia stock (Laffont, Griffin, and Englander) were buyers of Amazon shares.\nThough Amazon's online marketplace is considered the \"face\" of the company, it's not why billionaires have taken the plunge. Amazon's exceptional growth in cash flow has everything to do with its trio of fast-growing ancillary operating segments.\nNothing is more important to Amazon's cash flow or bottom line than the ongoing growth and success of cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Based on an analysis from Canalys, AWS accounted for a hearty 31% of global cloud infrastructure service spending to end 2023. As of the March-ended quarter, AWS had surpassed $100 billion in annual run-rate sales. With enterprise cloud spending still rapidly accelerating, the juicy margins associated with cloud services should allow Amazon to rapidly grow its operating cash flow.\nSubscription services (e.g., Prime) is another segment that can deliver sustained double-digit growth potential. In exchange for Prime member perks like free two-day shipping on most online marketplace orders and access to Amazon's growing content library, Amazon enjoys strong subscription pricing power with Prime. Amazon surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021, according to then-CEO Jeff Bezos, and has almost certainly added to this total.\nThe third higher-margin ancillary segment that does some heavy lifting for Amazon is advertising. When you're driving in the neighborhood of 2.5 billion monthly visitors to your site each month, as well as growing the number of Prime subscribers, it's easy to command higher prices from advertisers who want motivated shoppers to see their message(s).\nPut these three ancillary segments together and you get a company slated to more than double its cash-flow-per-share between 2023 and 2027. Relative to its future cash flow, Amazon remains historically cheap.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Tesla CEO Elon Musk has told Nvidia to prioritize shipments of AI processors to his companies X and xAI over the electric-vehicle maker, CNBC reported on Tuesday.\nThe news signals Musk is giving precedence to artificial intelligence-related development outside Tesla and fanned concerns some shareholders have raised over his commitment to the EV firm while running a number of other companies.\nThe development also comes ahead of a crucial shareholder vote on his pay package at Tesla.\n\"Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12K of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,\" an internal Nvidia memo from December showed, according to the CNBC report.\n\"In exchange, original X orders of 12K H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla,\" the memo said.\nThe change delays Tesla's receipt of more than $500 million in processors by months, according to CNBC.\nIn a post on X, Musk said Tesla had no place to store and turn on the Nvidia processors, adding that a planned expansion of its Giga factory in Texas was almost complete. \"This will house 50k H100s for FSD (full self-driving) training.\"\nHe announced earlier this year Tesla was increasing the number of Nvidia's most advanced chips it has deployed and will spend $10 billion on AI this year, as part of initiatives to advance the development of FSD software and robotics.\nThe billionaire is also pursuing AI development at X, and xAI, for chatbot Grok, among other applications.

        "Author": " Brett LoGiurato    and Alexandra Canal    ",
        "Text": "US stocks notched new record highs on Tuesday, continuing a furious AI-driven rally as Nvidia (NVDA) surpassed Microsoft (MSFT) to become the most valuable public company. \nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) finished the day up about 0.3% to secure its 31st record close of the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) hovered just above the flatline, notching its seventh straight record close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also edged higher, up roughly 0.2%.\nNvidia's stock price rose more than 3.5% to north of $135 per share, giving the chipmaker a market capitalization just over $3.34 trillion. With a 0.4% slide on Tuesday, Microsoft's market cap stood at around $3.32 trillion.\nAs a reminder, markets are closed on Wednesday in observance of Juneteenth.\nTechs have continued to lead an AI-driven rally that, as Yahoo Finance's Myles Udland wrote, investors simply can't afford to miss out on. The enthusiasm is leading several Wall Street banks to chase their year-end S&P targets higher, with one strategist saying the AI revolution is still in its \"early innings.\nStill, it wasn't all positive news after May's retail sales numbers disappointed.\nGovernment data released on Tuesday showed that retail sales increased just 0.1%, missing economist expectations, Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported. Meanwhile, April's numbers were revised to show a decline. It could be a sign of more consumer strain amid high interest rates and persistently stubborn inflation.\nAlso on Tuesday, a roster of Fed officials offered more commentary on the path of interest rates. Fed governor Ariana Kugler said she remained \"optimistic that improving supply and cooling demand will support continued disinflation.\"\n\"If the economy evolves as I am expecting, it will likely become appropriate to begin easing policy sometime later this year,\" she said.\nSo far the message after last week's rate decision and forecast update has been clear: Expect one rate cut in 2024. Investors seemingly haven't yet taken this to heart, with over 60% still expecting two cuts by the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nAnother day, another record close for both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC).\nThe benchmark index finished the day up about 0.3% to secure its 31st record close of the year. The tech-heavy gauge hovered just above the flatline, notching its seventh straight record close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also edged higher, up roughly 0.2%.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) surpassed Microsoft (MSFT) to become the most valuable public company. \nNvidia's stock price rose more than 3.5% to north of $135 per share, giving the chipmaker a market capitalization just over $3.34 trillion. With a 0.4% slide on Tuesday, Microsoft's market cap stood at around $3.32 trillion.\nAs a reminder, markets are closed on Wednesday in observance of Juneteenth.\nNvidia (NVDA) overtook Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday as the most valuable company in the world just two weeks after it took the No. 2 spot from Apple (AAPL).\nNvidia's stock price rose nearly 4%, eclipsing $136 per share and giving the chipmaker a market capitalization over $3.35 trillion. With a 0.3% slide on Tuesday, Microsoft's market cap stood at $3.32 trillion.\nAnd what's perhaps most eye-popping about Tuesday's move is how quickly Nvidia's market cap has surged higher.\nNvidia first crossed a $1 trillion market cap on June 13, 2023. The stock advanced north of $2 trillion on March 1, and then rapidly crossed the $3 trillion mark for the first time on June 5. The company's advance from a $1 trillion to a $3 trillion market cap was the fastest on record, easily topping the time Microsoft and Apple took to pass the benchmarks.\nIn the past year, Nvidia's stock is up more than 215%.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) increased its US budget deficit forecast for 2024, sending stocks modestly lower in late afternoon trading. The major indexes still hovered at record highs.\nNew estimates from the CBO estimate that the US budget deficit will balloon to $1.9 trillion. That amount is more than $400 billion (or 27%) larger than the agency previously estimated in February. The bulk of the increase is largely due to a boost in spending in Ukraine, along with President Biden's student loan proposals.\n\"The deficit is projected to increase to $2.9 trillion in 2034, $0.3 trillion more than the amount in the previous baseline. All told, the cumulative deficit over the 2025 to 2034 period is now projected to total $22.1 trillion, which is $2.1 trillion (or 10%) more than previously projected,\" the CBO said.\nThe agency also said it expects the Federal Reserve to respond to higher unemployment and slightly lower inflation by reducing interest rates beginning in early 2025. Previously, the CBO expected rate cuts to come in mid-2024.\nTo note, the CBO\u2019s updated projections were finalized on May 2, ahead of the Fed\u2019s latest policy meeting.\nVenu Sports, the upcoming sports streaming partnership among Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), unveiled its full management team on Tuesday.\nPete Distad, former Apple and Hulu executive, was previously announced as the joint venture's CEO.\nThe team includes former executives at leading entertainment, media, technology, sports, and sports betting companies.\nBrian Borkowski, who will serve as chief marketing officer, hails from FanDuel. Jessica Casano-Antonellis, senior vice president and head of communications, previously led communications at Sirius XM. Chief business officer Tim Connolly formerly led subscriber growth for Apple TV+ and MLS Season Pass at Apple.\n\u201cGetting the chance to assemble the starting lineup for the management team responsible for building the Venu organization, creating the culture, setting the pace of innovation, and ultimately, fueling the growth behind our forthcoming service has been an incredible opportunity,\u201d Distad said.\n\u201cWe searched for people with an entrepreneurial spirit who could bring diverse perspectives to Venu Sports with experience launching beloved consumer products and growing high-performing teams, and brought together a group of all-stars in their respective fields.\"\nThe streaming service, announced in February, is set to debut sometime this fall and comes as media companies face increased pressure from investors to scale their platforms and achieve profitability.\nVenu Sports will bring together the three companies' respective slates of sports networks. Collectively, the new service encompasses about 55% of US sports rights, according to Citi Research.\nAccording to the platform, the service will be made available directly to consumers via a new app. Subscribers will also have the ability to bundle the product with Disney+, Hulu, or Max.\nNvidia (NVDA) is now the most valuable public company in the world.\nThe chipmaker surpassed Microsoft's (MSFT) market cap on Tuesday, just two weeks after it took the No. 2 spot from Apple (AAPL).\nYahoo Finance's Josh Schafer and Dan Howley with the story:\nNvidia's stock price rose more than 3.5% to north of $135 per share, giving the chipmaker a market capitalization just over $3.33 trillion. With a 0.3% slide on Tuesday, Microsoft's market cap stood at $3.32 trillion.\nShares of Nvidia are up more than 215% over the last 12 months and more than 3,400% over the last five years. Year to date, Nvidia has gained 173%; Microsoft stock is up just less than 19% in 2024.\nNvidia's surge has made it a top weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), and the chipmaker has served a pivotal role in the benchmark index, hitting record highs in 2024.\nUp until May, the S&P 500 had traded with a near-perfect correlation to Nvidia's price movement, meaning that as Nvidia's stock rose, so did the broader index. As of Monday, Nvidia's stock gains alone had contributed about one-third of the S&P 500's year-to-date rise, according to data from Citi's equity research team.\nNvidia, which is the tech industry's go-to supplier for AI chips and integrated software, completed a 10-for-1 split on June 10.\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) has increased its stake in Occidental Petroleum (OXY) to nearly 29% of the company.\nYahoo Finance's Ines Ferr\u00e9 reports:\nBuffett has said Berkshire has no interest in buying control of Occidental, but the conglomerate has been a repeat dip buyer of the Houston-based company as the stock sits roughly 12% off its April peak. Prior to the Monday filing, Berkshire disclosed the purchase of 7.3 million shares.\nOccidental stock gained more than 1% on Tuesday to trade above the $61 level.\n\u201cMr. Buffett appears to step in and buy more OXY shares whenever the share price falls near or below $60. This bid sure appears to have set a floor on the share price,\u201d James Shanahan, equity analyst at Edward Jones, told Yahoo Finance.\nShanahan notes Berkshire\u2019s $15.4 billion position makes Occidental its sixth-largest stock holding. The company\u2019s top holding is Apple (AAPL), which currently sits at roughly 20% of Berkshire's market cap, after Berkshire trimmed its position in the iPhone maker in May.\nBerkshire is still highly involved in energy plays, as Chevron (CVX) remains a top-five holding despite the company selling some of its position as recently as March.\n\u201cTogether with the preferred share investment in OXY, Berkshire's bet on oil is almost $43 billion. Interestingly, this total has been $41-51 billion at the end of each quarter dating back to March 2022, which was the quarter when Berkshire began to buy OXY,\u201d said Shanahan.\nBuffett has been a vocal backer of Occidental Petroleum, publicly praising the company\u2019s CEO Vicki Hollub. He was also instrumental in helping finance Occidental\u2019s acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum in 2019.\nRead more here. \nApple is scrapping its buy now, pay later (BNPL) service \u2014 just over a year after its US launch.\nThe service, known as Apple Pay Later, debuted in March 2023 and allowed iPhone users to split purchases of up to $1,000 into four equal payments over six weeks with no added fees or interest.\nAmid the service's discontinuation, the company will rely on BNPL platforms like Affirm and Klarna, which were once threatened by Apple's entrance into the space. The tech giant recently announced plans to integrate Affirm into Apple Pay, where users will be able to access loans through the third-party app.\n\u201cWith the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S.,\u201d the company said in a statement late Monday.\n\u201cOur focus continues to be on providing our users with access to easy, secure and private payment options with Apple Pay, and this solution will enable us to bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across the globe, in collaboration with Apple Pay enabled banks and lenders.\u201d\nShares of both Apple and Affirm were down more than 1% on Tuesday.\nBank of America's Global Fund Manager survey for June was the most bullish since November 2021, driven by low 4% cash levels & big equity allocation.\nAccording to the survey, released Tuesday, investors expect global growth to be unchanged over the next 12 months with 73% of respondents predicting no recession. A \"no landing\" probability has peaked at 26% while most respondents anticipate a \"soft landing\" at 64%. Just 5% see a \"hard landing\" scenario, a new low.\nAs a refresher, a soft landing would materialize if the Fed is able to bring inflation down without causing a recession or a significant jump in unemployment. A hard landing would result if inflation comes down but at the expense of the US economy. A no landing would materialize if inflation does not come down at all.\nJust 8% of respondents say no Fed cuts in the next 12 months. 8 out of 10 investors expect two, three, or more cuts with the first cut forecast on Sept. 18.\nHigher inflation is fading as the biggest risk, with geopolitics and the US election on the rise at 22% and 16%, respectively.\nWhen asked which policy areas will most impact the upcoming US election, 38% said trade, 20% said geopolitics, 13% said immigration, 9% said taxation, and 7% answered government spending.\nLennar stock (LEN) was down more than 2% in early trading after the homebuilder's third quarter outlook for gross margin on home sales disappointed investors.\nThe company projected gross margin of 23% for the period, below analyst estimates of 24%, per Bloomberg data.\n\u201cWe suspect the likely culprit is the choppy mortgage rate environment that ended in May, which required elevated incentives that will flow through in 3Q closings,\u201d Buck Horne, Raymond James analyst, wrote in a note.\nRead more: Mortgage rates today, June 18, 2024: Rates go up\nHomebuilders like Lennar have pulled out all the stops to lure buyers as high mortgage rates keep both would-be buyers and sellers on the sidelines. While incentives like mortgage rate buydowns have helped companies in the space sell homes, Wall Street is concerned about builder profit margins taking a hit.\nLennar expects deliveries to range from 20,500 to 21,000 in the third quarter, with an average closing price of $420,000 to $425,000.\nThe Miami-based homebuilder reported second quarter earnings of $3.45 per share, higher than estimates for $3.19 per share. Revenue rose 10% to $8.8 billion, beating analysts estimates of $8.5 billion.\n\u201cThe macroeconomic environment remained relatively consistent with employment remaining strong, housing supply remaining chronically short due to production deficits over a decade, and demand strength driven by strong household formation,\u201d Stuart Miller, executive chairman and co-C of Lennar, said in a statement.\nThe disappointing retail sales report \"is showing the strain of elevated interest rates, with housing-related categories of spending continuing to decline in May,\" Oxford Economics said in a note early Tuesday.\n\"There was also a surprise decline in spending at restaurants and bars [which declined 0.4% during the month], though other evidence suggests spending on other services is still holding up well. A price-related fall in gasoline station sales also weighed on the headline figure,\" wrote Michael Pearce, Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist.\nRetail sales in May increased just 0.1%, falling shy of the 0.3% economists polled by Bloomberg had expected. In April, retail sales ticked down 0.2%, according to revised data from the Commerce Department.\nExcluding autos and gas, retail sales edged up 0.1%, below estimates for a 0.4% increase but above the 0.3% decline seen in April.\n\"Consumer spending is slowing because real income growth is moderating and because some consumers are becoming credit constrained amid elevated interest rates and rising credit card utilization,\" Pearce said. \"However, with unemployment unlikely to rise much and the state of households balance sheets still looking strong in aggregate, we expect consumer spending growth will remain close to its current pace in the second half of the year.\"\nRaymond James' chief economist Eugenio Aleman was a bit more pessimistic: \"The downward revisions to April shows a very weak start by the US consumer during the second quarter of the year, which is consistent with our view of the US economy.\"\nLast week, the Federal Reserve signaled it would lower interest rates just one time this year, down from the three cuts the central bank anticipated in its previous March projection.\nThe central bank still expects a strong economy to end the year. Officials see the unemployment rate holding steady at 4% in 2024, matching the previous forecast. Unemployment is expected to tick higher to 4.2% in 2025 before coming down to 4.1% in 2026.\nThe Fed maintained its previous forecast for US economic growth, with the economy expected to grow at an annualized pace of 2.1% this year before ticking down slightly to 2% in 2025 and remaining at that level through 2026.\nUS stocks hovered near record highs as all three major indexes hugged the flatline.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC), which secured its 30th record close of 2024, was muted at the opening bell, along with The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) similarly wavered as the tech-heavy index looked to build on a sixth straight record close.\nRetail sales increased at a slower-than-expected pace in May as high interest rates and inflation continued to weigh on consumers.\nRetail sales increased 0.1%, less than the 0.3% economists had expected. In April, retail sales ticked down 0.2%, according to revised data from the Commerce Department.\nExcluding autos and gas, retail sales increased 0.1%, below estimates for a 0.4% increase but above the 0.3% decline in April.\nCapital Economics chief North America economist Paul Ashworth noted Tuesday's retail sales reading adds to \"signs that consumers are struggling a little.\"\n\"The soft May retail sales data support our view that, after a disappointing first quarter, GDP growth remains a little lackluster in the second quarter too,\" Ashworth said.\n"

        "Title": "Jensen Huang made Nvidia a $3 trillion juggernaut. But the path to success was filled with \u2018despair\u2019 and \u2018torture\u2019",
        "Author": "  Seamus Webster ",
        "Text": "Nvidia has been holding a clinic in shattering expectations. The company\u2019s market cap has increased 160% in the past six months, up to $3.10 trillion, as the rush to cash in on A.I. has launched the chip maker into position as the third most valuable company in the world, trailing only Apple ($3.30 trillion) and Microsoft ($3.25 trillion).\nFor Nvidia\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, it's been an equally meteoric come up. Huang\u2019s wealth surged more than $62 billion this year, up to $106.1 billion, and he leapfrogged fellow tech star Michael Dell to become the 13th-richest person on the planet.\nBut the man at the helm of Nvidia\u2019s historic rise hasn\u2019t sugarcoated how difficult the road to success was, either for himself, or the company he founded more than 30 years ago.\nWhen Nvidia started in 1993, Huang, along with co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, began with an idea of creating chips that would enable realistic 3D graphics on personal computers\u2014or graphic processing units, specifically for video games.\nBut speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference in 2018, Huang told audience members that he always believed GPUs could have broader applications in society, otherwise there would have been \u201cno point in starting a company.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly hard to start a company; it\u2019s incredibly hard to start a business,\u201d Huang said at the conference. \u201cThe depth of despair, the suffering, the torture\u2014balanced by the great joy of doing something the world has never done before\u2014is beyond words can describe. So unless you believe you're going to make a real contribution to society it\u2019s going to be incredibly hard to start that journey.\u201d\nThe reason Nvidia got its start in gaming, Haung said, was that video games were the only area in technology where the computational potential was incredibly advanced, but there was also an enormous demand among consumers.\nOnce they realized the potential scale of GPU servers, Huang said they were able to move into workstations, supercomputers, self-driving cars, and ultimately A.I. But all of that was only possible because of PC gaming.\n\u201c3D graphics and video games are the engine of innovation in our company, the engine of [research and development] scale,\u201d he said at the conference.\nHuang has made other, more recent comments that paint a picture of entrepreneurship that is far from idyllic.\nDuring an interview on a podcast in the fall of 2023, Huang was asked what kind of company he would think about starting if he could turn back the clock 30 years, and the engineer-turned-executive had a somewhat surprising response.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf we realized the pain and suffering [involved] and just how vulnerable you\u2019re going to feel, the challenges that you\u2019re going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame, and the list of all the things that go wrong\u2014I don\u2019t think anybody would start a company. Nobody in their right mind would do it.\u201d\nCorrection, June 14, 2024: A previous version of this article misstated Nvidia's market capitalization in the headline.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Jason Ma ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's technological prowess has lifted the chip giant to the commanding heights of the red-hot artificial intelligence space.\nBut a former employee provided a key insight into CEO Jensen Huang's management philosophy that has also been key to the company's stratospheric rise.\nRene Haas, CEO of UK chip designer Arm, worked at Nvidia in the early 2010s and told the Financial Times that Huang organized the company around projects rather than traditional hierarchies, allowing him to access any layer of management and get answers directly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very unique culture,\u201d Haas told the FT. \u201cThe benefit of that is transparency and speed. And I think that is one of the things that Nvidia is really, really good at. They move very, very fast, they\u2019re very, very purposeful.\u201d\nThat speed was on full display earlier this month, when Huang surprised Wall Street by laying out a rapid cadence of new AI platforms.\nLast week, he said Nvidia plans to upgrade its AI accelerators every year as he announced the Blackwell Ultra chip for 2025 and a next-generation platform in development called Rubin for 2026.\nThe Computex trade show in Taiwan this past week fueled continued bullishness on AI and the chip sector, helping briefly boost Nvidia's market cap to the $3 trillion mark for the first time. That capped an epic rally that has seen the company\u2019s stock soar over 3,100% over the last five years and more than 200% in just the last year.\nIn the process, Huang's personal wealth has surged too. On Friday, he topped Michael Dell to become the world\u2019s 13th-richest person with a net worth of $106.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nFor his part, Huang\u2014who is among the 22 CEOs who founded their Fortune 500 companies\u2014has acknowledged that he is a demanding perfectionist and is not easy to work for.\n\u201cIt should be like that. If you want to do extraordinary things, it shouldn\u2019t be easy,\u201d he told 60 Minutes in April.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia After Its Stock Split?",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Everyone who has been saying that Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) share price would plunge just saw their prediction come true. But not in the way they expected.\nNvidia conducted a 10-for-1 stock split after the market close on Friday, June 7, 2024. Its share price at the market open on Monday was roughly 10% of the previous closing price.\nThe stock has soared nearly 30% since Nvidia announced its stock split during its first-quarter update on May 22. Is it too late to buy Nvidia stock after its split?\nThere's an easy answer to this question: It's absolutely not too late to buy Nvidia stock. Why is this answer so easy? The stock split changes nothing about the company's business.\nA stock split does two things. First, it increases the number of outstanding shares. In Nvidia's case, the number of shares jumped tenfold. Second, this increase lowers the share price by a proportional amount.\nDid you want to buy Nvidia before the stock split because of the skyrocketing demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs)? Have you been interested in the stock because of the prospects for its forthcoming Blackwell platform? Those reasons for buying remain intact. The only difference between now and before the stock split is that Nvidia's share price is much cheaper.\nGranted, it's possible that Nvidia's shares could fall further after the big surge leading up to the stock split. On the other hand, the stock's momentum could accelerate as retail investors who were previously on the sidelines because of the sky-high share price start buying Nvidia.\nNow for a more difficult answer to the question. The optimal time for buying Nvidia could now be past for reasons unrelated to the stock split.\nThe demand for Nvidia's chips remains exceptionally strong. The company's sales and profits continue to jump through the roof. However, some would argue all of this is already baked into Nvidia's share price.\nThe stock trades at nearly 71 times trailing-12-month earnings and almost 47 times forward earnings. Those valuation metrics reflect a lot of anticipated growth. Even Nvidia's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.51, based on five-year growth projections, isn't especially attractive.\nIs there anything that could realistically derail Nvidia's growth? The answer to this question is a resounding \"yes.\" Other chipmakers are scrambling to challenge Nvidia's market dominance, and several of the company's biggest customers are also developing their own custom chips in an effort to reduce their dependence on Nvidia.\nIf you want an opportunity to profit from Nvidia but have concerns about its growth, there's another approach. You could call it \"the Pelosi strategy\" after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul.\nMr. Pelosi has invested in Nvidia by buying deep-in-the-money call options with expiration dates at least a year out. The call options give him the right (but not the obligation) to purchase shares of Nvidia in the future. These options have strike prices that are deep in the money (well below the share price at the time the options were bought). This means their price correlates highly with changes in Nvidia's share price.\nImportantly, this approach lowers Pelosi's risk. He doesn't have to put up as much money since buying call options is less expensive than buying the corresponding number of Nvidia shares that those options give him the right to purchase.\nInvestors should still be bullish about Nvidia to employ the Pelosi strategy. The good news is that there's reason to be optimistic about the stock and the business that has nothing to do with its recent stock split.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares soon will trade at about a 10th of last week's price -- and for good reason. The company just completed a 10-for-1 stock split, and that's why as of the opening of today's trading session, you can get in on Nvidia stock with a little more than $100 instead of more than $1,000.\nStock splits, by offering more shares to current holders, lower the price of each individual share, making it easier for a broader range of investors to buy a particular stock. With its split, Nvidia joined the ranks of many technology companies that had seen their shares soar -- so made the move to rein them in and potentially prepare for a whole new era of growth. Companies from Alphabet to Amazon and Tesla all have performed stock splits over the past few years.\nSeeing Nvidia's share price roar past $900 earlier this year, investors speculated about a potential split, and when it was announced -- along with a stellar earnings report -- late last month, the stock surged past $1,000. So now that Nvidia has completed this much-awaited operation, here's what to look for next.\nFirst, a few details about the stock split. Nvidia issued the new shares to current holders after the close of trading on June 7. So today they will begin trading at the split-adjusted price. This doesn't change the total market value of Nvidia, which last week surged to $3 trillion to surpass that of Apple and become the second-biggest U.S. company (temporarily -- it's since dipped to settle just behind the iPhone maker).\nAnd the move doesn't change the value of your investment if you bought shares of Nvidia prior to the stock split. If you had one share back then, you now have a total of 10 -- but the investment still is worth about $1,200.\nIf you decide to buy or sell Nvidia shares today or at any point down the road, you'll note one difference. If you're a buyer, you can easily make a small investment in Nvidia without having to go the route of buying fractional shares. And if you want to sell, the split has offered you new flexibility: Shareholders who own $1,200 of Nvidia right now can lower their stake without completely closing out the position. You couldn't do that last week when one share was worth that amount.\nNow, let's move on to what's next for Nvidia. The stock split is positive for Nvidia and shareholders -- but don't expect it to push the stock higher or lower today or down the road. These operations are mechanical movements, so they don't act as a catalyst for share performance.\nBut here's the good news. Other elements are ready to drive Nvidia shares higher and for the long term, and these are linked to Nvidia's biggest business: designing graphics processing units (GPUs) and other products and services for artificial intelligence (AI) customers.\nTwo catalysts to watch in particular are the upcoming releases of Nvidia's H200, a GPU that Nvidia says nearly doubles the inferencing capabilities of the current H100. The company is preparing to ship the H200 in the second quarter and says demand is surpassing supply.\nThen, next up is something AI customers and the investing community have been eagerly awaiting: Nvidia's developed a whole new architecture, called Blackwell, and along with this, its highest-performing chip ever. The Blackwell architecture could result in 25 times lower total cost of ownership for customers and better energy consumption than the current Hopper architecture.\nNvidia is preparing to launch Blackwell later this year, and the company says demand for the platform also is greater than supply -- and this situation probably will continue into next year.\nNews regarding the launches of these products as well as the path of revenue moving forward are the catalysts that could determine whether Nvidia shares continue roaring higher in the coming months. The company's work with governments pursuing sovereign AI projects also may offer the stock direction.\nAll of this means that, yes, this recent stock split was a wise decision by Nvidia and could encourage more investors to get in on this growth story. But Nvidia's ability to keep its top market position and grow revenue at a rapid pace are what should guide the stock in the near term and over time -- and considering the company's track record and future prospects, these elements could help Nvidia shares continue to roar higher.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Text": "US stocks mostly finished in the red Friday as a tech-led rally showed real signs of fatigue for the first time in over a week.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both lost about 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) managed to climb just over the flatline.\nAll three indexes logged a weekly win, but the Nasdaq barely gained ground.\nThe quiet session comes after a notable dip on Thursday. The S&P had been flying higher, briefly crossing 5,500 for the first time. But the Nasdaq snapped a streak of seven straight record closes with its loss in the prior session.\nNvidia (NVDA), which briefly catapulted to the title of world's most valuable company this week, has led the AI-fueled rally. But after a sizable loss on Thursday, it lost more than 3% Friday. Other chip stocks, including Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), and Qualcomm (QCOM), slumped alongside Nvidia.\nInvestors are also assessing the broader health of the US economy and the path for interest rates. Former St. Louis Fed president James Bullard, an inflation hawk, said Thursday that last week's cool Consumer Price Index reading could pave the way for a rate cut in September. Around two-thirds of traders still expect rate cuts to begin then, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Next week investors will get a fresh reading from the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, which will provide another data point for central bankers to mull over.\nThe AI darling Nvidia lost ground for the second straight session as the major indexes mostly finished lower. A tech-led rally that has powered gains so far this month showed signs of weakness as investors took profits and paused the steady climb, at least for a moment.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both gave up about 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) eked out a win, rising just above the flatline.\nThe start of summer also brings a relative lull next week as investors come off record finishes for major indexes and the first signs of a slowdown in the staggering tech-led rally.\nEarnings season has gone quiet too, although Nike (NKE), Walgreens (WBA), FedEx (FDX), and General Mills (GIS) are among the major tickers set to report next week.\nA significant economic indicator is on the horizon, however. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, or PCE, will be released on Friday.\nThe PCE reading follows another inflation metric, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which earlier this month showed consumer price increases cooled during the month of May. If Friday's PCE reading also indicates a cooling of price pressures, it will give the Federal Reserve another reason to cut interest rates in the months ahead.\nMarket bets currently expect central bankers to lower rates starting in September. A favorable PCE reading would likely confirm that forecast, while a reading that showed stubborn inflation would probably push back expectations of the first rate cut.\nThe US presidential campaign is also coming into view. Investors will get their first taste of the presidential debates on Thursday night, when Joe Biden and Donald Trump face off on CNN. How the candidates view tax policy, global trade, the role of the Federal Reserve, and other economic issues will be top of mind for many viewers.\nYahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week:\nElon Musk revealed earlier this week that Super Micro (SMCI) will provide hardware for the supercomputer his AI startup is building. That triggered a pop in the stock.\nWhen Dell's (DELL) CEO said his company would be building an \"AI factory\" for Musk's xAI in partnership with AI kingpin Nvidia (NVDA), its shares also rose.\nAnd though the jumps in both names were short-lived, their performance this year and the response to Musk's one-word post are reminders that what he says matters to a lot of people and that anything related to AI will push markets around.\nIt doesn't take a contrived plan or a sideways approach to profit from Wall Street's excitement around AI technology. The main driver of 2024's seemingly unstoppable run is the earnings potential of the Magnificent Seven, which includes Nvidia, Tesla, and the platform giants.\nCiti analysts, who earlier this week upped their S&P 500 year-end target to 5,600, observed that more than two-thirds of the stock market\u2019s gains so far have flowed from the Magnificent Seven.\nAnd adding Elon to the mix certainly doesn't hurt.\nInvestors attempting to create a makeshift Musk basket of related tech holdings are doing the same thing with Nvidia. Because it's not just the Big Tech platforms churning out apps and productivity software that are drafting off AI exuberance. There's an entire ecosystem out there.\nNow that shareholders have backed Tesla's pay package for CEO Elon Musk, the company believes the judge presiding over the case should reverse her earlier ruling that invalidated the compensation deal, Reuters reported Friday.\nIn a filing that was made public on Friday, Tesla said it should now prevail in the case and that the company will file a motion to reverse the ruling.\nThe expected legal move comes after shareholders voted in favor of the pay pact, granting Musk and Tesla a major victory and ammunition to challenge the decision.\nTesla argued that the company has corrected the deficiencies the judge found in the run-up to the pay deal. By reviewing the package by an independent board member and seeking reapproval from shareholders who were given additional information, the company believes it addressed the finding that the original pay package should not have been approved.\nBut even with the support of shareholders, it isn't clear what the impact of the vote will have on the decision.\nThe legal team representing the shareholder who sued over the pay package has argued that the vote has no legal impact.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday.\nNvidia (NVDA): Shares of the AI darling are down more than 2% Friday afternoon as investors take profits and offer a break from the staggering pace of gains for the company that briefly had the highest market cap on Wall Street. Bank of America analysts reiterated a Buy rating this week with a $150 price target, calling Nvidia a \"top pick.\"\nAsana (ASAN): The maker of work management software gained 12% after the company approved a stock buyback program of up to $150 million for its Class A common stock. But Asana has had a tough going so far this year, with the stock down more than 30% year to date.\nGilead (GILD): The pharmaceutical company rose 2% Friday after seeing encouraging results from its twice-yearly shot to prevent HIV.\nNike (NKE): The sports apparel retailer gained more than 1% after analysts at Oppenheimer upgraded the stock from Perform to Outperform and raised its price target from $110 to $120, implying an increase of 26%. Nike will report earnings on Thursday next week.\nUS stocks clung closely to the flatline to start the afternoon session on Friday as this month's rally, led by the biggest tech names, paused as the week draws to a close.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) was unchanged, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped just below the flatline.\nIn a new mid-year outlook, economists at Bank of America forecast what they describe as a \"gilded glidepath\" for the US economy, defined by continuing outperformance and the absence of a hard landing through the end of 2026.\n\"Our forecast could easily be described as a gilded glidepath: it's close to perfection in every dimension,\" the analysts wrote on Friday.\n\"We assume the main factors that drove relative outperformance of the US economy in recent years continues, including strong growth in the labor force, the catch-up effect in employment, supportive fiscal policies, and the crowding in of domestic manufacturing investment,\" they said.\nThe analysts expect the Fed to begin the first interest rate cut in December. Central bankers, they predict, will, cut rates quarterly to land at a range of 3.5%-3.75% by 2026. But even as the Fed has avoided a hard landing so far, the economists do see risks ahead. The Fed could keep rates higher for longer if inflations remains sticky, they wrote.\nOther risks to their optimistic forecast include a faster-than-expected end to catch-up employment, rising inflation, which would force the Fed to tighten again, as well as geopolitical risks and the upcoming presidential election.\nThe AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) is having a down day. But the intensity of the fall highlights just how high the stock has climbed, and how closely Wall Street's most valuable companies are competing against one another for the coveted top spot.\nShares of the chipmaker fell more than 2% Friday morning. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed just over the flat line during the last hour of morning trading, trimming back earlier losses.\nAfter closing at a record $135 per share earlier this week, Nvidia's investors took profits and gave up some ground, offering the AI-fueled rally a breather. After briefly holding the title as the market's most valuable company, Nvidia slipped behind its rivals, dropping to a market cap of $3.14 trillion.\nMeanwhile the other players vying for the No. 1 position rose slightly. Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) gained 0.5% Friday, giving the company a market cap of $3.32 trillion. Apple (AAPL) shares increased by roughly the same amount, with the iPhone maker's market cap standing at 3.24 trillion.\nHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday.\nGilead (GILD): The pharmaceutical company rose almost 4% Friday morning after seeing encouraging results from its twice-yearly shot to prevent HIV.\nNikola (NKLA): Shares of the commercial EV maker gained more than 6% Friday following a brutal session Thursday when the stuck sank after after the company announced a 1-for-30 reverse stock split announcement. The reverse split will go into effect at the market's close on Monday, June 24.\nCarMax (KMX): The used car dealer increased 2% during morning trading after reporting fiscal first quarter earnings that beat analysts\u2019 estimates on earnings, even as the company reported lower margins from vehicle sales impacting the industry.\nNike (NKE): The sports apparel retailer gained close to 1% Friday after analysts at Oppenheimer upgraded the stock from Perform to Outperform and raised its price target from $110 to $120, implying an increase of 26%.\nThe cost of buying a home reached a new record high in May, making homeownership even more of a challenge for would-be buyers.\nThe median sales price for previously owned homes jumped to $419,300 \u2014 a 5.8% bump from May last year \u2014 and marked the 11th consecutive month of year-over-year price gains, according to the National Association of Realtors. It's the highest price ever recorded.\nThe jump in prices was more pronounced in some regions. In the Northeast, the median price rose to $479,200, a 9.2% gain from a year ago, while in the Midwest, the median price climbed to $317,100, a 6.4% surge from the prior year.\nSales of previously owned homes dropped 0.7% in May from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.11 million and 2.8% lower from a year ago.\n\u201cEventually, more inventory will help boost home sales and tame home price gains in the upcoming months,\u201d NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement. \u201cIncreased housing supply spells good news for consumers who want to see more properties before making purchasing decisions.\u201d\nThe drop in sales comes as mortgage rates remain elevated. The average weekly rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage slid to 6.87% from 6.95% a week prior, per Freddie Mac data. \nUS stocks mostly lost ground Friday at the opening bell as investors riding the tech-led rally took a breather.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost around 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose close to 0.2%.\n"

        "Author": "  Christiaan Hetzner ",
        "Text": "Nvidia will remain the gold standard for AI training chips, CEO Jensen Huang told investors, even as rivals push to cut into his market share and one of Nvidia's major suppliers gave a subdued forecast for AI chip sales.\nEveryone from OpenAI to Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla rely on Nvidia semiconductors to run their large language or computer vision models. The roll out of Nvidia's \u201cBlackwell\u201d system later this year will only cement that lead, Huang said at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.\nUnveiled in March, Blackwell is the next generation of AI training processors to follow its flagship \u201cHopper\u201d line of H100 chips\u2014one of the most prized possessions in the tech industry fetching prices in the tens of thousands of dollars each.\n\u201cThe Blackwell architecture platform likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history,\u201d Huang said.\nNvidia briefly eclipsed Microsoft and Apple this month to become the world\u2019s most valuable company in a remarkable rally that has\u00a0fueled\u00a0much of this year\u2019s gains in the\u00a0S&P 500 index. At more than $3 trillion, Huang\u2019s company was at one point worth more than entire economies and\u00a0stock markets, only to suffer a\u00a0record loss in market value\u00a0as investors locked in profits.\nYet as long as Nvidia chips continue to be the benchmark for AI training, there\u2019s little reason to believe the\u00a0longer-term outlook\u00a0is cloudy and here the\u00a0fundamentals\u00a0continue to look robust.\nOne of Nvidia's key advantages is a sticky AI ecosystem\u00a0known as CUDA, short for Compute Unified Device Architecture. Much like how everyday consumers are loath to switch from their Apple iOS device to a Samsung phone using Google Android, an entire cohort of developers have been working with CUDA for years and feel so comfortable there is little reason to consider using another software platform. Much like the hardware, CUDA effectively has become a standard of its own.\n\u201cThe Nvidia platform is broadly available through every major cloud provider and computer maker, creating a large and attractive base for developers and customers, which makes our platform more valuable to our customers,\u201d Huang added on Wednesday.\nThe AI trade did take a recent hit after memory chip supplier Micron Technology, a supplier of high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to companies like Nvidia, forecast fiscal fourth quarter revenue would only match market expectations of around $7.6 billion.\nShares in Micron plunged 7%, underperforming by a large margin a slight gain in the broader tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite.\nIn the past, Micron and its Korean rivals Samsung and SK Hynix have seen cyclical boom and busts common to the memory chip market, long considered a commodity business when compared with logic chips such as graphic processors.\nBut excitement has surged as demand for its chips needed for AI training. Micron's stock more than doubled over the past 12 months, meaning investors have already priced in much of management's predicted growth.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Noos2Mfdcg\n\u201cThe guidance was basically in line with expecations and in the AI hardware world if you guide in line that\u2019s considered a slight disappointment,\u201d says Gene Munster, a tech investor with Deepwater Asset Management. \u201cMomentum investors just didn\u2019t see that incremental reason to be more positive about the story.\u201d\nAnalysts closely track demand for high bandwidth memory as a leading indicator for the AI industry because it is so crucial for solving the biggest economic constraint facing AI training today\u2014the issue of scaling.\nCosts crucially do not rise in line with a model\u2019s complexity\u2014the number of parameters it has, which can number into the billions\u2014but rather grow exponentially. This results in diminishing returns in efficiency over time.\nEven if revenue grows at a consistent rate, losses risk ballooning into the billions or even tens of billions a year as a model gets more advanced. This threatens to overwhelm any company that doesn\u2019t have a deep-pocketed investor like Microsoft capable of ensuring an OpenAI can still \u201cpay the bills\u201d, as CEO Sam Altman phrased it recently.\nA key reason for the diminishing returns is the growing gap between the two factors that dictate AI training performance. The first is a logic chip\u2019s raw compute power\u2014as measured by FLOPS, a type of calculation per second\u2014and the second is the memory bandwidth needed to quickly feed it data\u2014often expressed in millions of transfers per second, or MT/s.\nSince they work in tandem, scaling one without the other simply leads to waste and cost inefficiency. That\u2019s why FLOPS utilization, or how much of the compute can actually be brought to bear, is a key metric when judging the cost efficiency of AI models.\nAs Micron\u00a0points out, data transfer rates have been unable to keep pace with rising compute power. The resulting bottleneck, often referred to as the \"memory wall\" is a leading cause for today\u2019s inherent inefficiency when scaling AI training models.\nThat explains why the\u00a0U.S. government focused heavily on\u00a0memory bandwidth\u00a0when deciding which specific Nvidia chips needed to be banned from export to China in order to weaken Beijing\u2019s AI development program.\nOn Wednesday, Micron said its HBM business was \u201csold out\u201d all the way through the end of the next calendar year, which trails its fiscal year by one quarter, echoing\u00a0similar comments\u00a0from Korean competitor SK Hynix.\n\u201cWe expect to generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in FY24 and multiple [billions of dollars] in revenue from HBM in FY25,\u201d Micron said on Wednesday.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "NVIDIA Omniverse, Isaac and Metropolis Enable Delta Electronics, Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron to Digitally Build, Simulate and Operate Factory Digital Twins\nRobotic Factory\nTAIPEI, Taiwan, June 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- COMPUTEX --\u00a0NVIDIA today announced that major Taiwanese electronics makers are using the company\u2019s technology to transform their factories into more autonomous facilities with a new reference workflow. The workflow combines NVIDIA Metropolis vision AI, NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 physically based rendering and simulation, and NVIDIA Isaac\u2122 AI robot development and deployment.\nBy using the workflow to build digital twins for real-time simulation of different factory layouts, manufacturers can optimize space, processes and efficiency without costly physical changes.\n\u201cAI for manufacturing is here. Every factory is becoming more and more autonomous due to the transformational impact of generative AI and digital twin technologies,\u201d said Deepu Talla, vice president of robotics and edge computing at NVIDIA. \u201cWith NVIDIA Omniverse, Metropolis and Isaac, the industrial ecosystem can accelerate its adoption of autonomous technologies, helping advance operational efficiencies and lower costs.\u201d\nElectronics Manufacturers Adopt NVIDIA Technology to Build Robotic FacilitiesDelta Electronics, Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron are using the reference workflow to build, simulate and operate their robotics-enhanced facilities.\nIn a COMPUTEX keynote demo, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang demonstrated how Foxconn, one of the world\u2019s largest electronics manufacturers, develops digital twins of its factories on NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for virtually integrating 3D data from leading industry tools such as Teamcenter from the Siemens Xcelerator platform.\nOmniverse helps Foxconn\u2019s teams optimize equipment layout for operational flow and AI cameras that will monitor worker safety with NVIDIA Metropolis. Foxconn can then use the factory digital twins as virtual training environments to simulate, test and validate its autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) built on NVIDIA Isaac Perceptor acceleration libraries, as well as its AI robot manipulation arms, which are powered by NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator AI models.\n\u201cAI and robotics are poised to revolutionize manufacturing, enhancing safety on factory floors and driving significant operational efficiencies,\u201d said Young Liu, CEO and chairman of Foxconn. \u201cBy integrating NVIDIA Omniverse, Metropolis and Isaac into our operations, we can create sophisticated digital twins of our factories to train robots, optimizing workflows with unprecedented precision and reducing costs.\u201d\nDelta Electronics, a manufacturing leader in electronics and IoT-based smart green solutions, is using NVIDIA Isaac Sim\u2122, an extensible robotics simulation platform developed on Omniverse and OpenUSD, an open and extensible ecosystem for 3D worlds, to virtually integrate its demo production lines. It then generates physically accurate, photorealistic synthetic data for training computer vision models for its NVIDIA Metropolis-powered automatic optical inspection and defect detection solutions.\nPegatron, a Taiwan-based manufacturer and service provider, is deploying an NVIDIA Metropolis multi-camera workflow and launching a new suite of services that connects its NVIDIA Omniverse and Metropolis factory digital twin workflow to NVIDIA NeMo\u2122 and NVIDIA NIM\u2122 to help factory operators \u201cchat\u201d in real time. The technological advances will help improve worker safety and productivity in Pegatron\u2019s massive factory network that spans over 21 million square feet and produces over 15 million assemblies per month.\nWistron, a global leader in electronics manufacturing, has built digital twins of its factories to accelerate the production of NVIDIA DGX\u2122 and NVIDIA HGX\u2122 servers. Now, it is extending its use of Omniverse to develop digital twins of the data centers that are used to test and ensure the quality, performance and energy consumption of newly assembled NVIDIA HGX systems.\nUsing NVIDIA Omniverse to simulate its facility and workflows first, Wistron brought its factory online in half the typical time \u2014 just two and a half months instead of five \u2014 and increased worker efficiency by more than 50% through testing and optimizing layouts.\n\u201cThe combination of NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA Metropolis allows us to test new layouts virtually to identify new processes and monitor real-time operations using live IoT data from every machine on the production line,\u201d said Alec Lai, president of global manufacturing at Wistron. \u201cDigitalizing our factory planning process has reduced end-to-end cycle times by 50%.\u201d\nEcosystem Expansion to Industrial ApplicationsLeading Taiwan systems integrator Kenmec is an early implementer of both Omniverse and Metropolis workflows and services for major manufacturers such as Giant Group.\nTo help developers across the ecosystem, these digital twin workflows are available as a reference architecture series.\nLearn more about the newly available updates to NVIDIA Isaac.\nWatch Huang\u2019s COMPUTEX keynote to get the latest on AI and industrial digitalization.\nAbout NVIDIANVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nFor further information, contact:Natalie HerethEnterprise CommunicationsNVIDIA Corporationnhereth@nvidia.com\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance, and availability of our products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA Metropolis vision AI, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA Isaac AI robot, NVIDIA Isaac Perceptor acceleration libraries, NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator AI models, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, NVIDIA NeMo, NVIDIA NIM, NVIDIA DGX and NVIDIA HGX servers, and NVIDIA HGX systems; third parties using and adopting our technologies and products, our collaboration with third parties and the benefits and impact thereof, and the features, performance and availability of their offerings; every factory becoming more and more autonomous due to the transformational impact of generative AI and digital twin technologies; and with NVIDIA Omniverse, Metropolis, and Isaac, the industrial ecosystem being able to accelerate their adoption of autonomous technologies, helping them advance operational efficiencies and lower costs are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

        "Author": " Alexandra Canal    and Karen Friar    ",
        "Text": "US stocks closed mixed on Tuesday, pulled in opposite directions by the Nasdaq and the Dow, as AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) rebounded from a three-day skid to surge nearly 7%.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) finished the day up roughly 1.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.4%, both breaking three-session losing streaks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) remained the only major index in the red, slipping 0.8%, or about 300 points, after a surge to start the week.\nOn Monday, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 took a bruising as Nvidia's slide dented the tech rally that has powered gains this year. Investors are seen as taking profits scored in AI-linked names as a stellar quarter draws to a close, raising the question of whether recent losses have further to go.\nElsewhere, the wait is on for Friday's update to the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, a favored inflation input for the Federal Reserve. Governor Michelle Bowman on Tuesday stressed she's willing to hike interest rates if holding them steady fails to bring price pressures under control.\nOn the economic data front, home prices set a new record high in April although annual growth slowed from the previous month, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller report.\nMeanwhile, a reading on consumer confidence highlighted cracks in previous resilience. According to the  latest reading from the Conference Board, the index came in at 100 for the month of June, below the 101.3 seen in May. The results were in line with what economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected.\nUS stocks closed mixed on Tuesday as a rebound in shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) fueled a Big Tech rally while recent economic data and hawkish Fed commentary dragged down the Dow.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) finished the day up roughly 1.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) remained the only major index in the red, slipping 0.8%, or about 300 points, after a surge to start the week.\nLeading into a recent drawdown that began reversing on Tuesday, Nvidia stock had been on a tear.\nAt its recent peak, the stock was trading nearly 100% higher than its 200-day moving average, a technical indicator that calculates the average closing price for the last 200 days.\nDating back to 1990, the largest stock in the stock market, which Nvidia recently became for a brief period, had never traded this far above its 200-day moving average, according to data from BTIG chief market technician Jonathan Krinsky.\nThis move, Krinsky said, put Nvidia in a \"league of its own.\"\nPrior to this run, the largest spread seen from a 200-day moving average came in 2000, from none other than Cisco, the darling of the dot-com bubble. The move came in late March 2000, just before the bubble popped.\nKrinsky did note \"the fundamentals are much different this time around,\" but added, \"We remain concerned about a near-term unwind of many [year-to-date] leaders.\"\nHere are some of the stocks trending on the Yahoo Finance homepage in afternoon trading:\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL): The tech giant saw shares rise about 2% on Tuesday after reports circulated the company plans to show off new artificial intelligence features, which will include updates to its Pixel devices and Android platform, at a \"special event\" slated for Aug. 13.\nCarnival Corporation (CCL): Shares of the cruise operator surged more than 8% on Tuesday after the company beat earnings on both the top and bottom lines and raised its full-year guidance. Carnival also said it's seen a surge in advanced bookings, signaling robust demand for 2025.\nHome Depot (HD): Shares of the home improvement giant slid over 3% after Pool Corp. (POOL) warned of \"lower new pool construction and remodel activity\" amid the current macroeconomic backdrop. Shares of builders and other home improvement giants like Lowe's (LOW) also moved lower on the news.\nThis year's stock market rally has been led by just a few large tech names \u2014 but that might not be such a bad thing.\nYahoo Finance's Josh Schafer has the scoop: \n\"We see a small group of tech winners leading stock gains as a feature of the artificial intelligence (AI) theme \u2014 not a flaw,\" Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, wrote in a research note on Monday. \"We stay overweight U.S. stocks.\"\nAI darling Nvidia (NVDA) has accounted for nearly one-third of the S&P 500's gains this year, and outperformance in quarterly results from large-cap tech continues to be a reason why earnings for the S&P 500 are growing year over year.\nAs of Monday's close, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO) had also contributed more than a quarter of the major index's gains.\nOne potential concern is that the market could be at risk if a few large tech companies that have driven a lion's share of the gains stop surprising to the upside.\nHowever, research from Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, shows this might not be an issue.\nWilson found roughly 20% of the top 500 stocks are outperforming the broader index over a rolling one-month period. This is the lowest percentage of companies outperforming in Wilson's dataset dating back to 1965.\nWilson's work noted that after similar narrow breadth readings where less than 35% of companies are outperforming the index on a one-month basis, the S&P 500 rose about 4% on average over the next six months.\n\"Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,\" Wilson said. \"We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high-quality/large-cap pockets for now.\"\nWilson argued that when considering the impact of high interest rates on corporations, this makes sense. Investors have flooded large-market-cap stocks that have held up well in the higher rate environment and are seeing earnings grow more than their smaller peers.\nAnd a slew of recent upgrades to year-end S&P 500 targets reflect similar sentiment. Three Wall Street firms cited tech outperformance as part of the reason the index is doing better than they initially thought this year.\nTech was the biggest leader in Tuesday's trading session, lifted by a rebound in shares of AI darling Nvidia (NVDA). The chipmaker rose over 5% after a fall of over 6% on Monday.\nThe communications and services sector also saw a lift in the session while real estate served as the biggest laggard, dragged down by more disappointing housing data.\nHome prices set a new record high in April, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller report, although it wasn't all doom and gloom as annual growth slowed from the previous month.\nOverall, markets were mixed with a 1% jump in the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) competing against a 1% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). The S&P 500 (^GSPC) traded in positive territory, up about 0.1%.\nNvidia stock (NVDA) climbed about 5% on Tuesday, reversing a three-day slide that erased roughly $430 billion of the AI chip giant's market cap.\nIt was a stark fall from grace for the stock, which hit a record close exactly one week ago when it briefly surpassed Microsoft (MSFT) as the most valuable company in the world.\nYahoo Finance's Ines Ferr\u00e9 has more:\n\"I think it's way overblown,\" Kenny Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors, said of the sell-off. \"I don't think people should be nervous about what's happening with Nvidia.\"\n\u201cI would use this weakness as an opportunity,\" he added, noting the timing of the decline.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the end of the quarter, so it\u2019s a quarter-marking period. You\u2019ve got a lot of big assets that are trying to reshuffle and rebalance,\" he said.\nPolcari added he wouldn't be surprised if the stock slid \"another 5% or 8%.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia's market cap climbed back to hover around the $3 trillion market cap, though it was still below the valuations of Microsoft or Apple (AAPL).\nNvidia has played a pivotal role in buoying the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) to repeated record highs in 2024. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company completed a 10-for-1 stock split on June 10.\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) prices are regaining some strength after prices dipped below $60,000 on Monday \u2014 their lowest level since early May.\nThe cryptocurrency saw prices rebound about 1% to trade above $61,650 a coin in late morning trading on Tuesday. Other cryptos like Ethereum (ETH-USD) also rose following Bitcoin's positive moves.\nBitcoin is down about 12% over the past three months but is still up more than 45% on the year, buoyed by recent SEC approvals of spot bitcoin ETFs.\nConsumer confidence declined slightly in June, putting a halt to any signs of a rebound.\nThe latest index reading from the Conference Board was 100, below the 101.3 seen in May and in line with the 100 economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected.\n\"Confidence pulled back in June but remained within the same narrow range that's held throughout the past two years, as strength in current labor market views continued to outweigh concerns about the future. However, if material weaknesses in the labor market appear, Confidence could weaken as the year progresses,\" said Dana M. Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board.\nPeterson added, \"Consumers expressed mixed feelings this month: their view of the present situation improved slightly overall, driven by an uptick in sentiment about the current labor market, but their assessment of current business conditions cooled.\"\nUS stocks opened mixed on Tuesday as AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) eyed a cautious comeback from a three-day skid, rising more than 0.2% in early trading.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up roughly 0.5%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) remained the only major index in the red, slipping about 0.2% after surging over 200 points to start the week.\nHome prices set a new record high in April as the market remains tight. But annual growth slowed from the previous month.\nHome prices in the 20 largest US metros increased 7.2% in the last 12 months ending in April, lower than the 7.5% annual gain in the previous month, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller. On a monthly basis, home prices across the 20 biggest cities increased 0.4% in April compared to the previous month.\nLow inventory, high mortgage rates, and record home prices have put the housing market out or reach for many would-be buyers. Economists at Bank of America believe that housing hurdles aren\u2019t going away anytime soon.\n\u201cThe US housing market is stuck, and we are not convinced it will become unstuck anytime soon,\u201d Michael Gapen, an economist at Bank of America, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\u201cAfter a surge in housing activity during the pandemic, it has since retreated and stabilized. We view the forces that have reduced affordability, created a lock-in effect for homeowners, and limited housing activity will remain in place through our forecast horizon,\u201d the economist added.\nTo this point, the investment bank believes that the pandemic housing shocks still have to pass through the market. Bank of America expects home prices to rise by about 4.5% this year and 5.0% next year, but then fall back to 0.5% in 2026.\nAs if you need another money thing to worry about.\nIn an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger late Monday, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reminded investors that the Trump tax cuts are set to expire in 2025.\nI can't think of the last investor I talked to who expressed a concern about the expiration and how it may impact markets.\nBut Yellen did her best job to bring this back into the light:\nHow the markets will react in 2025 should the tax cuts not get extended due to deficit concerns is, of course, wildly unknown today. It shouldn't be ignored in your investment planning process, however. Consider this alone: No tax cut extension would mean the top tax rate would return to 39.6% from 37%.\nThat's real money for real people.\nYou can watch Jenn's full interview with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen below.\nWhile everyone appears to now be an Nvidia (NVDA) expert and is out there waxing poetic on the stock's recent abrupt slide, I will not go that route this morning.\nInstead, I wanted to serve up some factual numbers with the help of BTIG's technical analyst Jonathan Krinsky. They provide nice context on why Nvidia shares are taking a little pause.\nHere's what Krinsky has to say, as if to remind the masses that stocks don't go up every single day.\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia stock has soared 715% since the beginning of 2023, making it very hard to ignore. The company has added $2.5 trillion to its valuation in that time, thanks entirely to red-hot demand for its data center chips designed for processing artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.\nBut the AI industry is expanding quickly, and investors have a growing number of opportunities to consider. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), for example, is a leader in AI-based cybersecurity, and its products have become an essential part of the software stack for businesses of all sizes.\nNvidia bears are a rare breed on Wall Street, but so are CrowdStrike bears right now. Here's why it could be a great addition to any stock portfolio -- even one that already includes Nvidia.\nThe enterprise cybersecurity industry has a history of fragmentation. Different vendors often specialized in different areas -- some excelled at cloud security, while others developed best-in-class identity security -- so businesses had to piece products together from multiple providers. However, the industry is shifting, and cybersecurity vendors who can cover all bases with one platform are winning big.\nThat has been CrowdStrike's strategy from the start. Its Falcon platform is a lightweight solution with 28 modules available to customers that cover cloud security, identity security, endpoint protection, exposure management, and more.\nDuring the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 30), CrowdStrike said 65% of its customers were using five or more modules. Plus, the number of customers who adopted eight modules soared by a whopping 95% compared to the year-ago period. It's a clear sign organizations are rushing to consolidate their cybersecurity needs onto one platform.\nIt's no surprise, considering a recent study by International Data Corporation (and sponsored by CrowdStrike) found that companies save $6 for every $1 they invest in the company's platform. Additionally, CrowdStrike claims it can make security teams twice as effective with incident investigations concluding 66% faster than with a fragmented cybersecurity stack.\nAI is the secret sauce behind CrowdStrike's speed and effectiveness. Automation is key to dealing with modern-day threats, which continue to grow in both frequency and sophistication. Data is the lifeblood of AI, and CrowdStrike's models are trained on more than 2 trillion security events each day, which means they become faster and more accurate over time.\nCrowdStrike generated $921 million in revenue during the fiscal first quarter, up 33% year over year and also comfortably above management's forecast of $904 million.\nBut the company's bottom-line results were even more impressive. It delivered its fifth-consecutive quarter of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profitability with $42.8 million in net income. This came on the back of careful cost management with operating expenses rising only 27% year over year, allowing more money to flow to the bottom line.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which strips out one-off and noncash expenses like stock-based compensation, CrowdStrike delivered $231.7 million in net income, which was a whopping 70% increase from the year-ago period. It translated to $0.93 in non-GAAP earnings per share, which was also better than management's guidance of $0.90.\nSimply put, CrowdStrike has converted its leadership position in AI and its soaring revenue growth into an increasingly profitable business, which is something many of its peers have been unable to achieve so far.\nThe Wall Street Journal tracks 49 analysts covering CrowdStrike stock, and 38 (78%) of them have given it the highest-possible buy rating. A further seven are in the overweight (bullish) camp, and the remaining four recommend holding. No analysts recommend selling.\nTheir average price target (which typically covers the next 12 to 18 months) for CrowdStrike stock is $397.68, which implies upside of 17% from where it trades as of this writing. However, the stock could crush the Street's estimate long term.\nCrowdStrike ended Q1 with $3.6 billion in annual recurring revenue, but it believes it can nearly triple that figure over the next five to seven years to reach $10 billion. Customers' preference for a unified platform will be instrumental to hitting that milestone, and CrowdStrike is already proving it can save them money while delivering the most advanced AI-powered protection.\nCrowdStrike is a best-in-class cybersecurity provider, and it can be a best-in-class cybersecurity and AI stock for any portfolio.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has\u00a0more than tripled\u00a0the market.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and CrowdStrike made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks\n*Stock Advisor returns as of June 3, 2024\nAnthony Di Pizio has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Building wealth can take decades, or if you own Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), it can take about a year. Over the past year, the stock has risen a remarkable 165% due to accelerated growth related to heavy investing in artificial intelligence (AI) across the technology space.\nBut it's not alone in creating massive investment returns. Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) is no slouch, either; its shares are up more than 120%. That leaves investors with an excellent dilemma: Which is the better AI stock to own?\nIt turns out that one is far more likely to continue its run than the other.\u00a0Which one? Here is what you need to know.\nThe strong momentum behind both stocks underlines each company's key role in AI. It's unclear what that technology might look like 5 or 10 years from now, but there's a strong chance that Nvidia and Arm Holdings will be in the thick of it.\nNvidia's AI chips have become, more or less, the building blocks of AI technology. AI language models like ChatGPT train on massive data centers with thousands of chips.\nChips from Nvidia specialize in demanding, high-compute applications. These traits are perfect for AI, and the company has done a great job optimizing its chips and software for it.\nCompanies investing to build these AI models have all gravitated to Nvidia, giving the company an estimated 90% market share for AI chips. It's unclear when (or if) it will lose its stranglehold on the chip market.\nArm Holdings is arguably the gold standard for computer chip design. Its central processing unit (CPU) architecture is the foundation for roughly half the world's computer chips. That footprint includes smartphones, vehicles, computers, and more.\nArm makes money by charging royalties and licensing fees on each chip that uses its intellectual property. That includes Nvidia's next-generation Grace series of data center CPUs.\nBoth Nvidia and Arm Holdings will likely have a big say in the future of AI.\nBoth companies are already seeing the impact of AI on their business. Nvidia and Arm are highly profitable, and the accelerated sales growth is lining each company's coffers:\nArm's business has proved to be more profitable; the company's primary expense is research and development. Roughly $0.70 of every revenue dollar winds up as free cash flow. But Arm is a much smaller company than Nvidia. Its trailing-12-month sales are just over $3.2 billion.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia isn't quite as efficient as Arm in converting sales to cash flow, but it's bringing in far more revenue: nearly $80 billion over the past year.\nNvidia's ability to sell a physical product at such high margins is impressive, and that is why it will generate far more cash flow than Arm over the long term. More cash flow gives a company more options. Nvidia even came close to buying Arm Holdings before the company went public, but the merger fell through. Give Nvidia the edge here for its comparable profitability at a much larger size.\nAnalysts are equally optimistic about both companies' earnings growth over the coming years. Consensus long-term estimates call for roughly 31% annualized earnings growth for both Nvidia and Arm. However, you can see below that the starting valuation for each is dramatically different:\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio that is half as expensive\u00a0as Arm Holdings', Nvidia stock has a built-in margin of safety. Assuming growth estimates prove accurate, Nvidia is far more likely to perform better.\nAs they say, the higher they go, the further they can fall. High valuations leave less room for things to go wrong. Arm Holdings could perform exceptionally well as a business, and something -- even something external to the company, like broader market volatility -- could send shares lower.\nNvidia and Arm Holdings are blue chip technology stocks with a bright future in AI due to their exceptional competitive footing. However, given the dramatic difference in valuation, Nvidia seems like the better AI stock to buy today.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Super Micro Computer",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amid the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom, shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) have set the stock market on fire in 2024, racking up gains of 166% and 197%, respectively, as of this writing. Thanks to the booming demand for the AI-enabling hardware they sell, they have experienced stunning accelerations in their revenue and earnings growth.\nNvidia's dominance in the AI chip market has translated into phenomenal growth, and Super Micro Computer isn't far behind. Data center operators are flocking to its modular server solutions to mount the AI chips that Nvidia and other companies sell. However, if you are looking to add an AI stock to your portfolio and want to choose between one of these two, which one should you be buying right now?\nNvidia reportedly controlled a whopping 94% of the AI chip market at the end of 2023. The company's results for the first quarter of its fiscal 2025 (which ended on April 28) suggest that its dominance has it on course for another year of terrific growth.\nRevenue rose a stunning 262% year over year to $26 billion. Its impressive pricing power led to a 461% surge in adjusted earnings to $6.12 per share. Management's revenue guidance of $28 billion for the current quarter suggests that its top line is on track to jump 107% year over year, which would be an acceleration from the 101% growth it delivered in the same period last year.\nHowever, emerging growth avenues in the nascent AI market indicate that Nvidia could end up doing even better than that. For instance, governments across the globe are reportedly pouring huge amounts of money into AI infrastructure, and sovereign investments in AI technology are expected to contribute $10 billion to Nvidia's top line this fiscal year, as compared to nothing in the previous one.\nMore specifically, governments are looking to make large language models (LLMs) in local languages based on country-specific data. On Nvidia's May conference call, management pointed out that Japan, France, Italy, and Singapore are already investing in AI infrastructure. It expects more countries to join the bandwagon. \"The importance of AI has caught the attention of every nation,\" said CFO Colette Kress.\nSaudi Arabia, for instance, is reportedly looking to invest $40 billion in AI initiatives, while China's AI-focused spending is forecast to exceed $38 billion by 2027. Meanwhile, key Indian companies such as Tata Group and Reliance Industries are relying on Nvidia's chips to train LLMs.\nIn short, Nvidia's customer base is diversifying beyond the major cloud infrastructure providers that have been deploying its chips in large numbers to train and deploy AI models. Spending on AI chips is expected to grow more than 10-fold over the next decade, generating $341 billion in revenue in 2033 compared to $23 billion last year. The stage seems set for Nvidia to maintain its tremendous growth as it takes solid steps to ensure that it remains the dominant player in this space.\nThat's why analysts forecast that the company's top line will keep growing at a healthy pace from fiscal 2024's reading of nearly $61 billion.\nSo, Nvidia should remain a top AI stock as the race to develop AI applications by companies and governments alike has created a secular growth opportunity.\nSupermicro's growth is entwined to some extent with that of Nvidia. Data center operators require server rack solutions of the type that Supermicro sells to mount the processors sold by Nvidia and other chipmakers. So, it is not surprising that demand for Supermicro's servers has simply taken off.\nIn its fiscal 2024 third quarter, which ended March 31, its revenue jumped 200% year over year. Non-GAAP net income per share, meanwhile, jumped by a whopping 307%. So, Supermicro isn't all that far behind Nvidia when it comes to how AI has supercharged its fortunes. The company is guiding for revenue of $14.9 billion in the current fiscal year, which ends this month. This would be a big jump over the $7.1 billion in revenue it reported in its fiscal 2023.\nMore importantly, analysts are expecting its top line to nearly double over the next couple of fiscal years.\nThe good part is that Supermicro can sustain a healthy pace of growth beyond the next couple of fiscal years. That's because the demand for AI servers is expected to expand at a compound annual rate of 25% through 2029. The market is expected to generate annual revenue of almost $73 billion after five years, up from $17.5 billion in 2022.\nSupermicro is growing at a faster pace than the AI server market right now. As it turns out, its growth is faster than that of more established companies such as Dell Technologies, which has sold $3 billion worth of AI servers in the past three quarters. Supermicro generated $9.6 billion in revenue in the past three quarters and gets more than half its revenue from selling AI-related server solutions.\nSupermicro has been able to make a dent in the AI server market despite the presence of bigger players. Also, with the moves that the company has been making to increase its production-utilization rate and its manufacturing capacity, it could corner a bigger share of the AI server market in the future.\nLike Nvidia, even Supermicro looks like a solid long-term AI play. But is it worth buying over Nvidia?\nBoth Nvidia and Supermicro are high-growth companies benefiting big time from the proliferation of AI. So investors' choice about which stock they may want to buy right now is going to boil down to the valuation. Supermicro is substantially cheaper than Nvidia as far as their earnings and sales multiples are concerned.\nHowever, in terms of the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, the story is a bit more interesting. That metric is a forward-looking valuation determined by dividing a company's trailing earnings multiple by the earnings growth that it is expected to deliver over a future period. Any (positive) PEG ratio below 1 is viewed by most investors as indicating a bargain stock. And on that metric, both Nvidia and Supermicro are undervalued.\nSo by at least one forward-looking measure, both Nvidia and Supermicro are attractive buys right now for anyone looking to add a growth stock to their portfolios. More importantly, both these companies seem capable of delivering the outstanding growth that the market expects from them, thanks to the lucrative opportunities they are sitting on. And that's why investors can consider buying either stock, despite the terrific gains they have clocked so far this year.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Here's What Happened After Nvidia's Last 3 Stock Splits (and What That Means for the Stock Today)",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) recent stock split may have been one of the most anticipated events on investors' financial calendars. On June 7, the company completed its 10-for-1 stock split, and the stock will begin trading at the split-adjusted price on Monday, June 10. A stock split involves issuing more shares to current holders to bring down the price of a stock that's reached high levels. This doesn't change the overall market value of a company or a stock's valuation, but only the per-share price.\nSince stock splits are purely mechanical, they aren't a reason for you to buy or sell a particular stock -- and that means they aren't known to prompt stock gains or declines. Still, it's interesting to take a look at a stock's path following a split, and now is the perfect time to look back at Nvidia's performance after its past few splits.\nDoes history offer us clues about how Nvidia stock may perform in the coming months? Let's find out.\nPrior to last week's operation, Nvidia had performed a total of five stock splits over time, but we'll consider only the past three. These happened in July of 2021, September of 2007, and April of 2006.\nIn the two earlier periods, the stock fell right after the split, but then went on to gain in the following months. After the 2007 split, though, Nvidia shares declined from their post-split high and spent some time trending lower.\nNVDA data by YCharts\nAfter the next stock split, in 2021, the shares followed a similar pattern -- but then, about a year later, they started picking up momentum.\nAnd by 2023, they were roaring higher, buoyed by optimism about artificial intelligence (AI)-related revenue.\nSo, what does this tell us about what might happen with Nvidia shares in the months to come? It's important to remember that Nvidia was quite a different company a few years ago, with its high-powered chips generating most of their revenue in the gaming industry.\nOver the past few years, Nvidia's sales of its graphics processing units (GPUs) to customers in the AI space have skyrocketed, and that business has soared past the gaming one. For example, in the most recent quarter, gaming revenue came in at $2.6 billion, while data center revenue topped $22 billion.\nThis means it's difficult to compare Nvidia's share performance in the pre-AI-boom days to the stock performance of today. Of the charts, though, the 2021 one is the most relevant because around this time, Nvidia was seeing increasing revenue at its data center business. For example, in the first quarter of 2021, data center revenue was already climbing in the double digits.\nBut here's the key element to note: The progressive gains we saw in the years following the 2021 stock split weren't due to the stock split itself. Instead, Nvidia's impressive revenue growth and investor optimism about its future in AI spurred the performance.\nAnd now, as we look forward, this same element could continue to boost Nvidia's shares. After all, we're still in the early days of AI development, suggesting more and more companies will sign up for Nvidia's products and services.\nSo, as we can see in the charts above, Nvidia's past stock splits didn't produce any clear pattern that may be replicated. Yes, the stock did slip post-split and then go on to gain -- but these movements most likely were driven by investors locking in profits or switching in or out of Nvidia for fundamental reasons. The stock splits themselves didn't provide direction for the stock.\nToday, this confirms that the most recent stock split won't serve as a catalyst for share performance. If Nvidia stock rises, falls, or stagnates in the coming weeks or months, we can attribute the movement to news related to earnings prospects -- not to the stock split.\nAll of this means that today the best way to predict Nvidia's future stock performance is to closely watch the company's next moves -- to see if it can stay ahead of rivals and dominate in the high-growth AI market.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Chibuike Oguh ",
        "Text": "By Chibuike Oguh\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Shares of Nvidia surged nearly 7% on Tuesday, snapping out of a three-session tailspin that had erased about $430 billion from the artificial intelligence chipmaker's market value.\nNvidia's shares finished at $126.09, after a tumble that saw them lose around 13% from their June 18 close of $135.58. The drop followed a rally that accelerated after a 10-for-1 stock split that took effect on June 10.\n\"The bounce today is a normal technical bounce after a 15% drop in three days; you're not going to go straight down every single day,\" said Tom Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital in New York. \"It's a great company, it's a great CEO, and you have insiders selling three-quarters of a billion worth of stock just as retail investors were getting involved with the split,\" Hayes added.\nNvidia's breathtaking rise and its position as the dominant provider of chips to support artificial intelligence applications have made it emblematic of this year's tech-driven boom in U.S. stocks.\nShares of Nvidia, which last week briefly became the world's most valuable company, are up 154% this year and have accounted for nearly 30% of the S&P 500's year-to-date return as of Monday's close, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The index is up 14.6% this year.\nThe recent selloff helped ease some worries about Nvidia's valuation, which now stands at about $3.1 trillion from a high of about $3.3 trillion earlier this month.\n\"It's a normal correction for a company that has made a run and gotten a lot of publicity,\" said Tom Plumb, chief executive and portfolio manager at Plumb Funds, which has Nvidia as one of its largest holdings. \"Until there's a confirmation that the actual business would justify the slowing of the momentum, I don't think you've reached the all-time peak.\"\nBullishness on Nvidia was evident in the options market, though the stock's recent share price slide appears to have made traders more cautious.\nNvidia call options, typically used to bet on a rising stock price, outnumbered puts by 1.4-to-1 over the last three sessions, Trade Alert data showed. That compared to a call-to-put ratio of 1.6-to-1 for the prior 10 sessions.\nAt the same time, Nvidia short sellers, who bet on declines in the stock, have gained $4.97 billion in the past three sessions combined, according to data analytics firm Ortex Technologies.\nMeanwhile, retail investors have likely been buyers of the stock on the recent dip, said Mario Iachini, senior vice president of Vanda Research, which tracks the behavior of individual investors.\n(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York; Additional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed, Suzanne McGee, Medha Singh, and Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Chris Reese, Aurora Ellis and David Gregorio)\n"

        "Text": "Stock splits\u00a0are back in focus once again, after semiconductor giant Nvidia announced during its fiscal 2025 first-quarter report (for the quarter ended May 22) that it intended to split.\nNvidia's 10-for-1 forward stock split went into effect on June 7. It wasn't surprising to see Nvidia take this step, even though a stock split is simply a cosmetic move that reduces the price per share of a company in lieu of an increase in outstanding shares. After all, Nvidia stock has climbed a tremendous 727% since the beginning of 2023 thanks to the robust demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\nNvidia management pointed out that the split has been done \"to make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors.\" It's also worth noting that Nvidia is the sixth S&P 500 company to execute a stock split this year, and Bank of America analysts believe that more splits in the technology arena could be on the way.\nThis is the reason Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), a stock that gained 322% since the beginning of 2023 and has a market cap of $1.29 trillion, could undergo a stock split. Each share of Meta is trading at just over $500, and management may want to reduce the price of each share through a split to make it accessible to more investors, even though the move won't alter the company's fundamentals.\nIt's worth noting that Meta has never split its stock. It remains to be seen whether management will decide to make such a move. However, it would be prudent for investors to take a closer look at its fundamentals, which won't be affected by a stock split, as they are going to play a critical role in deciding the stock's future direction.\nThough Meta's share price is north of $500, retail investors can still get to invest in the stock through brokers who allow purchases of fractional shares. That's why it's important to take a closer look at the social media and digital advertising giant's business prospects as smaller investors can still buy fractional shares even if there isn't a split.\nMeta operates in the multibillion-dollar digital advertising market, which was worth an estimated $680 billion last year. Last year, Meta's advertising revenue came in at $132 billion, indicating that its share of the digital ad space stood at just over 19% last year. This year, global digital ad spending is forecast to increase by almost 9% to $740 billion. The good part is that Meta's growth indicates that it's gaining more share in this space.\nThe company's ad revenue increased 26% year over year in the first quarter of 2024 to $35.6 billion. Meta expects overall revenue to increase to almost $38 billion in the current quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be a jump of 19% year over year. It's worth noting that Meta's revenue increased 11% in the same period last year.\nSo the company's digital ad business is gaining momentum, and that's good news for investors, as the global digital ad market is expected to clock $966 billion in revenue in 2028. A key reason Meta has been gaining traction in this market is its focus on integrating AI tools into its popular applications such as Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\nIts AI tools are meant to help both creators and advertisers using its platforms, and the good part is that its tools are driving an acceleration in growth. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company's April earnings conference call: \"AI has also always been a huge part of how we create value for advertisers by showing people more relevant ads, and if you look at our two end-to-end AI-powered tools, Advantage+ Shopping and Advantage+ App Campaigns, revenue flowing through those has more than doubled since last year.\"\nMore importantly, Meta is continuing to push the envelope in the digital ad market by launching more AI-focused tools. The company recently announced an AI-powered ad program for businesses on WhatsApp, a move that could help it monetize its popular messaging service. Given that AI is expected to account for more than 90% of ad purchases by 2029, according to GroupM, then Meta is doing the right thing by focusing on integrating this technology into its business.\nAs such, it's easy to see why analysts are expecting Meta's earnings to grow at an annual rate of 30% for the next five years, compared with 11% annual growth in the past five.\nWhile each share of Meta is priced at over $500, a closer look at the company's valuation indicates that it's cheap considering the impressive growth it's been delivering. Meta stock is trading at 29 times trailing earnings, and 26 times forward earnings.

        "Text": "By Amanda Cooper\nLONDON (Reuters) -Global stocks hit record highs on Wednesday, driven by a rally in tech shares that has made AI chipmaker Nvidia the world's most valuable company, while the dollar stalled as soft U.S. retail sales data suggested rates could fall this year.\nMSCI's All-World index was up 0.15% at 805.12, having traded at an all-time high of 805.43.\nA burst higher in U.S. tech stocks on Tuesday allowed Nvidia to dethrone Microsoft, which boosted shares in chipmakers in Asia overnight.\nU.S. stock index futures also rose, with those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 up 0.23% and those on the S&P 500 up 0.1%. In Europe, the STOXX 600 fell 0.1%.\nThe pound rose after data earlier showed British inflation returned to the Bank of England's 2% target in May for the first time since 2021.\nThe fall in inflation will be welcomed by both Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the BoE - but likely has come too late either to turn around Sunak's fortunes at next month's election or to prompt a rate cut from the central bank on Thursday.\n\"With UK inflation at 2% and inflation in the U.S. - if you take PCE - at 2.7%, this is hardly disruptive,\" Lombard Odier economist Samy Chaar said, referring to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure the Personal Consumption Expenditures index.\n\"It gives credibility to the idea that the Bank of England act in August at the latest and then that should be followed by the Fed in September,\" he said.\nSterling, which is down around 0.2% so far this month, last traded at $1.2728, up 0.15%, while the euro rose 0.1% to $1.0747, but was still down 1% in June.\nThe single currency has been under pressure since French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap election last week after his ruling centrist party was trounced by the far right in the European Parliament elections.\nU.S. markets were closed on Wednesday, which kept overall market volatility subdued.\nRATE CUT HOPES\nData on Tuesday showed U.S. retail sales barely rose in May and figures for the prior month were revised considerably lower, suggesting economic activity remained lacklustre in the second quarter.\nThe numbers led to a small boost in rate-cut expectations for September, with traders pricing in a 67% chance of easing compared with a 61% chance a day earlier, the CME FedWatch tool showed. Markets are pricing in 48 basis points of cuts this year.\n\"(The) Fed will need more data to support its case for a rate cut and investors should not overact to one or two data points,\" said Vasu Menon, managing director of investment strategy at OCBC.\nLast week, mild U.S. inflation readings contrasted with an overall hawkish stance by Fed officials, who trimmed their previous median projection for three quarter-point rate cuts this year to one.\n\"Rate cuts are a stronger story for 2025 but that's fine because there is hope that it will happen in a bigger way over the next two years even if 2024 remains uncertain, and that will keep markets supported,\" Menon said.\nFed officials are looking for further confirmation that inflation is cooling and for any warning signs from a still-strong labour market as they steer cautiously toward what most expect to be a rate cut or two by the end of this year.\nThe dollar index, which measures the performance of the U.S. currency against six others, held steady at 105.19.\nThe Japanese yen drifted, leaving the dollar mostly unchanged at 157.92, near last week's six-week highs.\nThe yen has lost a third of its value against the dollar in the last 4-1/2 years, mostly due to the wide gap between interest rates in Japan and those in the United States.\nMinutes of Bank of Japan's April policy meeting showed policymakers debated the impact a weak yen could have on prices, with some flagging the chance of raising interest rates sooner than expected if inflation overshoots.\nIn commodities, oil prices rose, with Brent crude futures up 0.6% at $85.80 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures gained 0.48% to trade at $81.96.\n(Additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore; Editing by Jamie Freed, Jacqueline Wong, Alex Richardson, Angus MacSwan and Rod Nickel)\n"

        "Author": "  ELAINE KURTENBACH ",
        "Text": "BANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Asian shares are mixed after a rebound for Nvidia propped up a weakened Wall Street.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei jumped 1.4% to 39,726.39, buoyed by strong demand for technology shares driven by the enthusiasm over Nvidia and artificial intelligence.\nTokyo Electron gained 3.2% and Advantest Corp. soared 6.6%. Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. added 1.3%.\nThe Kospi in Seoul was up 0.2% at 2,781.15.\nChinese shares retreated. Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged 0.1% lower to 18,052.55 and the Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.5% to 2,936.71.\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 declined 0.9% to 7,765.40.\nShares rose in Taiwan and India and edged higher in Thailand.\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.4% and neared its all-time high set a week earlier, closing at 5,469.30. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Nvidia, dropped 0.8% to 39,112.16, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.3% to 17,717.65.\nMost stocks outside Wall Street\u2019s frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology fell. Nvidia climbed 6.8%, and without that gain, the S&P 500 would have dropped to a loss for the day. The chip company\u2019s shares snapped a three-day losing streak where they had shed nearly 13% for their worst such stretch since 2022.\nNvidia has the power to swing the S&P 500 around because it\u2019s grown to become one of Wall Street\u2019s largest and most influential companies.\nVoracious demand for its chips to power artificial-intelligence applications has been a big reason for the U.S. stock market\u2019s run to records recently, even as the economy\u2019s growth slows under the weight of high interest rates. But the AI boom has been so frenzied that it\u2019s raised worries about a possible bubble in the stock market and too-high expectations among investors.\nSolarEdge Technologies dropped 20.6% after it said a customer that owes it $11.4 million filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which raises questions about how much the solar-power company can collect and when. The smaller companies in the Russell 2000 index also fell 0.4%.\nBroadly, sales at retailers across the country have been up and down recently as companies highlight how lower-income customers are struggling  to keep up with still-rising prices. The job market, though, still looks mostly solid. A report on Tuesday also showed confidence among U.S. consumers fell this month, but not by quite as much as economists expected.\nUpper-income households seem to be doing better, and they\u2019re booking trips on cruise ships. Carnival steamed 8.7% higher after it raised its profit forecast for 2024. The cruise company said bookings for the rest of the year are the best on record in terms of both price and occupancy. And bookings for next year may end up even better.\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 21.43 points to 5,469.30. The Dow dropped 299.05 to 39,112.16, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 220.84 to 17,717.65.\nIt\u2019s been mostly falling since topping 4.70% in late April, which has relaxed the pressure on the stock market. Yields have sunk on hopes that inflation is slowing enough to convince the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate  later this year.\nThe Fed has been keeping the federal funds rate at the highest level in more than 20 years, hoping to grind down on the economy just enough to get inflation  under control. The hope on Wall Street is that the Fed will cut interest rates at the exact right time. If it waits too long, the economy\u2019s slowdown could careen into a recession. If it\u2019s too early, inflation could reaccelerate.\nIn other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 29 cents to $81.12 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\nBrent crude, the international standard, was up 31 cents at $85.32 per barrel.\nThe dollar rose to 159.79 Japanese yen from 159.63 yen. The euro was nearly unchanged at $1.0715.\n___\nAP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.\n"

        "Author": "  Jeran Wittenstein ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. is the most expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, with its shares trading for roughly 23 times the company\u2019s projected sales over the next 12 months.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSupreme Court Poised to Allow Emergency Abortions in Idaho\nYouTuber Dr Disrespect Was Allegedly Kicked Off Twitch for Messaging Minor\nBolivia\u2019s President Arce Swears in New Army Chief After Coup Bid\nFedEx Stokes Investors With Hint of a Freight Deal\nVolkswagen Invests $5 Billion in EV Startup Rivian to Form Joint Venture\nBut there\u2019s a problem with that valuation. In the age of the artificial intelligence boom, no one can figure out what the chipmaker\u2019s revenues are actually going to be \u2014 not the Wall Street analysts covering Nvidia or Nvidia executives themselves. So how are investors supposed to calculate whether the shares are expensive or not?\nFor more than a year now, a surge in demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips sparked by the frenzy surrounding AI has made a mockery of Wall Street\u2019s quarterly financial estimates. Analysts aren\u2019t making up numbers, they take their cues from management like they do with every other company. However, even Nvidia\u2019s leadership is struggling to anticipate how much money the chipmaker will generate three months into the future.\nSince Nvidia\u2019s sales began exploding in its fiscal quarter that ended in April 2023, revenue has exceeded the midpoint of the company\u2019s own forecast by an average of 13%, more than twice the average over the past decade. When Nvidia reported results in August, sales topped its projection by 23%, the biggest beat since at least 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nA representative for Nvidia declined to comment.\nBallparking Sales\nPart of what makes modeling for Nvidia so difficult is that supply is the most uncertain variable when demand is booming, making the chipmaker unique, according to Brian Colello, an analyst at Morningstar, who last month raised his price target for the shares to $105 from $91. They\u2019re currently trading at around $127.\nAssuming steady improvement in Nvidia\u2019s ability to increase supply, Colello said he adds up to $4 billion to Nvidia\u2019s quarterly revenue to ballpark the upcoming quarter\u2019s sales.\n\u201cI\u2019m not the first analyst to be raising my price target or fair value or being surprised that revenues are far ahead of what we thought a year ago,\u201d Colello said. \u201cIt\u2019s been interesting and rewarding but certainly challenging.\u201d\nColello isn\u2019t the only one raising his price estimate. On Friday, Melius analyst Ben Reitzes raised his price target on Nvidia for the fifth time this year, to $160 from $125, implying a gain of 26% from Friday\u2019s closing price.\nOf course, there are plenty of traders buying Nvidia solely based on momentum. Nvidia has gained 156% this year and overtook Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday to briefly become the world\u2019s most valuable company at $3.34 trillion. That rally helped drive a record $8.7 billion into tech funds last week through June 19, according to a Bank of America Corp.\u2019s analysis of data from EPFR Global. Nvidia shares have since fallen 6.7%, erasing more than $200 billion in market value.\nFor investors inclined to stare at discounted cash flow models that have more variability than they have in the past, the gap between estimates and actual results has created a conundrum.\nIn the past five quarters, analyst estimates for Nvidia\u2019s sales have deviated from actual results by an average of 12%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s the third-most among the S&P 500 companies that have posted average quarterly revenue of at least $5 billion in the last five quarters and have at least 20 analysts covering them.\nWhat Price?\nWith Nvidia\u2019s business booming and its biggest customers like Microsoft pledging to spend even more on computing hardware in coming quarters, the main question for investors is what\u2019s a reasonable price to pay for a stock whose profit and sales growth is far superior to its megacap peers.\nBased on current estimates, Nvidia is projected to deliver profit of $14.7 billion on sales of $28.4 billion in the current quarter, up 137% and 111%, respectively, from the same period a year ago. Meanwhile, Microsoft\u2019s sales are expected to rise 15% with Apple projections sitting around 3%.\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s valuation multiples are rich, they look more reasonable given Nvidia\u2019s growth, especially considering the estimates keep coming in low. To Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, a bigger concern is that the degree to which Nvidia surpasses Wall Street\u2019s growth expectations will soon start subsiding, just due to the company\u2019s sheer size. That could make it harder to justify the shares\u2019 price tag.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the risk comes in,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cYou\u2019re paying a high price for a large market cap company where the beats have been trending lower and that\u2019s likely to continue.\u201d\n--With assistance from Matt Turner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election\nMusk\u2019s Population Obsession Comes With a Dark History\nThe FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along\nWhy BYD\u2019s Wang Chuanfu Could Be China\u2019s Version of Henry Ford\nHow Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for \u2018You\u2019 Perfume Into a Lasting Business\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

This comes as the chip giant\u2019s stock price tripled in 2023 and had already more than doubled this year.\nAlthough stock splits don\u2019t change a company\u2019s overall market value, the lowered share price certainly prompts the discussion of if it's time to buy NVDA after previously trading near all-time highs of over $1,000.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMarket Value\nNvidia\u2019s dominance as the leader in semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence had recently led to its market capatilization surpassing Apple AAPL\u00a0at over $3 trillion to be the second highest-valued company in the United States behind Microsoft MSFT. \nIndicative of Nvidia\u2019s dominance, this towers over other noteworthy chip leaders in AMD AMD\u00a0and Intel INTC\u00a0which have market caps of $271 billion and $130 billion respectively.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPost-Split Growth Trajectory\nCertainly, Nvidia\u2019s market\u00a0cap\u00a0and industry leadership make the case for investing in its stock and It's noteworthy that stock splits have no bearing on a company\u2019s underlying fundamentals or\u00a0earnings although earnings per share (EPS) are diluted to reflect the increased number of shares.\nIn this regard, Nvidia\u2019s annual earnings are now forecasted at $2.65 per share ($26.54 per share/10) for its current fiscal 2025 with FY26 EPS projected to expand 22% to $3.25. Of course, sales are not affected by a stock split either and Nvidia's top line is expected to soar 91% in FY25 to $116.4 billion versus $60.92 billion in FY24. Better still, FY26 sales are projected to climb another 22% to $142.29 billion.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTakeaway\u00a0\nOptimistically, Nvidia\u2019s stock split does look like an opportunity to get in on the tech\u00a0behemoth's\u00a0expansive growth at a more reasonable price with NVDA boasting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nThe forward stock split also comes at an ideal time for investors as Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell series of GPUs are expected to officially launch later in the year and are thought to be the most powerful AI chips on the market ahead of its current H200 series and AMD\u2019s MI300 series.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "When key insiders buy shares of their company, they're probably confident about its future. Sure, that confidence could be misplaced. However, most investors see insider buying as a positive sign.\nBut it can be a much different story when key insiders sell shares. In some cases, such moves could hint that they aren't optimistic about the stock's future -- at least over the near term.\nThat leads me to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock has been on a roll, skyrocketing more than seven times over the last three years and soaring more than 160% so far in 2024. However, Insiders are selling their shares of Nvidia. Should you?\nSince the beginning of May, 10 Form 144 filings have been reported by Nvidia to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There are two important things to know about Form 144. First, it's a notice of the proposed sale of securities. Second, it's only used when there's a planned sale of 5,000 or more shares or an aggregate amount of over $50,000.\nThe most prominent person selling Nvidia stock is the company's CEO, Jensen Huang. Nvidia notified the SEC that Huang planned to sell 120,000 shares on June 13, 2024. At the market close on that date, this transaction would have been worth around $15.5 million.\nHuang wasn't the only Nvidia executive selling shares. Executive vice president of operations Deborah Shoquist sold 41,140 shares worth more than $45 million on June 3, 2024.\nSeveral members of Nvidia's board of directors also got in on the action. Dawn Hudson sold a total of 25,000 shares on three separate occasions since May 29, 2024. Board members Tench Coxe, John Dabiri, Michael McCaffery, Brooke Seawell, and Mark Stevens also sold some of their Nvidia shares in recent weeks.\nThese insider sales could be alarming to some investors. To use an old saying: Are the rats fleeing a sinking ship? Nope. There's more to the story.\nThe shares Huang sold were part of his executive compensation package. Specifically, they were restricted stock units (RSU) and performance stock units (PSU). Company CEOs frequently sell such shares when they're allowed to do so.\nImportantly, Huang owned nearly 93.5 million shares of Nvidia as of March 25, 2024. That's almost 3.8% of the company's outstanding shares. His recent sales were only a drop in the bucket compared to his total holdings. Huang still has plenty of skin in the game.\nMost of the other sales (including the ones by Shoquist and several board members) were also of restricted stock units. Investors shouldn't be too concerned about these transactions.\nI don't think the recent insider sales of Nvidia are a reason for outsiders to sell the stock. However, there could be some reasons for you to consider selling.\nNvidia's jaw-dropping gains might have caused the stock to make up a worrisome percentage of your overall portfolio. Some investors might want to trim their positions as a result.\nMy colleague Sean Williams predicts that Nvidia stock is poised to plunge by at least 50%. If you agree with his rationale, selling soon makes sense.\nHowever, Nvidia's underlying business remains strong. The company continues to execute exceptionally well. The demand for its graphics processing units isn't waning. Those are great reasons to hang on to a stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) A Risky Investment?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n View our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nAs you can see below, NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt at April 2024, down from US$11.0b a year prior. However, it does have US$31.4b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$21.7b.\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$15.2b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$12.7b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$31.4b as well as receivables valued at US$12.4b due within 12 months. So it can boast US$15.9b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nHaving regard to NVIDIA's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$2.86t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\nEven more impressive was the fact that NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 956% over twelve months. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 82% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that NVIDIA has net cash of US$21.7b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. The cherry on top was that in converted 82% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$39b. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example - NVIDIA has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock looks almost unstoppable. The company's sales and profits have been soaring, and demand for its chips continues to skyrocket as tech companies look to develop artificial intelligence (AI) models. This year, its market cap topped $3 trillion, landing it a spot among the three most valuable companies in the world.\nBut all that success could come at a cost. Nvidia has become so dominant and important in its part of the AI space that it has drawn the attention of antitrust regulators.\nAccording to a New York Times article, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are proceeding with antitrust investigations into three significant players in the AI industry: Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\nThere's no denying how successful Nvidia has become as a result of the emergence of generative AI. ChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022, and since then, Nvidia's share price has risen by around 600%. As the leading provider of the high-end processors necessary to train and power AI models, most companies that want to develop such software are going through Nvidia. And as the Times report notes, one issue is that Nvidia's AI software platform \"locks customers into using its chips.\"\nIn the case of OpenAI, the company's generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, has become hugely successful, and even former employees believe that there needs to be more oversight of such systems given how quickly the AI industry has been growing. Microsoft is also a major player in the industry, and has purchased a 49% stake in OpenAI.\nIf the antitrust investigation of Nvidia leads to charges, there are many possible outcomes. Those could be as minimal as regulators fining the company, or as serious as ruling that it must restructure its operations, and possibly divest itself of certain business units.\nFinancially, the company is in an excellent position to weather any fines it might face: Nvidia has generated more than $39 billion in free cash flow over its last four reported quarters, and during that time, its profits have totaled nearly $43 billion.\nIt's difficult to predict the outcome when it comes to any legal case. Given the significance of AI and how quickly these three companies become the major players in the industry, I'm inclined to think that if the Justice Department's investigation concludes Nvidia violated antitrust laws, the consequences could be more significant than simple fines or penalties. But I also don't think they would be something as drastic as a breakup of the tech company.\nAntitrust cases can take years to play out, which can be both good and bad news for investors -- good in the sense that they may not directly impact the business under scrutiny right away, but bad because they cast a cloud over the target that doesn't lift until the matter is resolved.\nAlthough antitrust cases can be concerning, investors shouldn't worry too much about these developments. Besides, predicting with any accuracy what regulators and the courts will do in these situations is next to impossible.\nFor now, long-term investors should stay the course. This news isn't a reason to sell your shares of Nvidia since, effectively, nothing has happened yet.\nIf, however, you are risk-averse and are worried about the long-term risk this poses for the GPU giant, it may be a good idea to consider investing in other AI stocks, especially given that Nvidia's valuation is effectively priced for perfection. When a stock carries such a high price tag, any hint of bad news can lead to a sell-off.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia completed a 10-for-1 stock split after the market closed on Friday, June 7. That split follows substantial price appreciation driven by enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia shares are up more than 200% in the past year.\nYet, several billionaire hedge fund managers trimmed their positions in Nvidia during the first quarter, before the stock split was announced, and reinvested the money in other AI companies.\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 2.9 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 68%. Meanwhile, he increased his position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) by 155%, making it the ninth-largest holding in his portfolio.\nSteven Schonfeld of Schonfeld Strategic Advisors sold 96,793 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 58%. Meanwhile, he increased his stake in Alphabet by 195%, making it the ninth-largest holding in his portfolio, excluding options contracts.\nPaul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment sold 103,337 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 78%. As a caveat, Jones purchased call options on Nvidia, which allow him to benefit from a price increase with a smaller capital outlay. Meanwhile, he increased his stake in Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) by 54%, though it remains a relatively small position.\nLouis Bacon of Moore Capital Management sold 2,006 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 19%. He also started positions in Alphabet and Snowflake, though neither rank among the top 25 holdings.\nThe trades made by those hedge fund managers do not mean Nvidia is a bad investment. All four fund managers still have exposure to the chipmaker, as do plenty of other wealthy investors. However, Alphabet and Snowflake warrant further consideration.\nAlphabet is the largest ad tech company and the third-largest cloud infrastructure and platform services provider in the world. Its leadership in advertising is predicated on its ability to engage internet users and collect data with popular web platforms, such as Google Search, YouTube, and Chrome. Similarly, its strong presence in cloud computing reflects its technological prowess and extensive data center footprint.\nAlphabet is slowly losing ground in digital advertising. Its market share is projected to slip to 27.4% this year, down from 28.1% last year. But Google Cloud Platform is actually gaining market share in cloud infrastructure and platform services, accounting for 11% of spending in the fourth quarter, up from 10%\u00a0in the prior year.\nAlphabet is integrating its latest AI model, Gemini, into both ecosystems to boost growth. For instance, Gemini powers AI overviews designed to make Google Search more engaging and streamlines ad campaign creation with a conversational interface. Gemini also automates tasks in Workspace applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, and it can be fine-tuned by Google Cloud customers to create custom generative AI applications.\nAlphabet is particularly well positioned to monetize AI through its cloud computing business. Forrester Research recently ranked Google Cloud Platform as the leader in AI infrastructure solutions,\u00a0awarding the company the highest scores in current offering, development strategy, and market share. Forrester also ranked Google's Gemini as the leading large language model, ahead of OpenAI's GPT-4.\nAlphabet reported encouraging financial results in the first quarter. Revenue increased 15% to $80.5 billion due to strong momentum in cloud computing and modest growth in advertising. Meanwhile, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income jumped 57% to $23.7 billion, helped along by cost-optimization efforts, like headcount reductions and the integration of different business teams.\nGoing forward, Wall Street analysts estimate that Alphabet will grow earnings per share at 17.2% annually over the next three to five years. That forecast makes its current valuation of 26.7 times earnings seem reasonable. From that price, I think Alphabet can outperform the S&P 500 over the next three to five years.\nSnowflake is best known as a cloud data warehouse, a system that stores data optimized for queries and business intelligence. In fact, Forrester recently recognized the company as a leader among cloud data warehousing platforms. But Snowflake also functions as a data lake, a system that stores raw data for analytics and AI, and its platform supports data sharing.\nBeyond that core functionality, Snowflake provides several adjacent solutions. Its Snowpark developer framework supports the training of AI models, its Cortex service brings generative AI and machine learning models to Snowflake data, and its Native Application Framework allows businesses to build and deploy applications on the platform. Snowflake is unique in its ability to support those features on a single platform across multiple public clouds.\nThe company reported mixed first-quarter financial results. Its customer count jumped 21% to 9,822, and the average existing customer spent 28% more. In turn, revenue increased 33% to $829 million on strong growth in core storage and analytics capabilities. But management also mentioned encouraging momentum with newer products. More than half of customers now use Snowpark, and over 750 customers have already used Cortex (which launched in May).\nThe bottom line was more troubling. Non-GAAP operating margin contracted one percentage point in the first quarter, and non-GAAP net income declined 7% to $0.14 per diluted share. Snowflake also lowered its full-year margin guidance, but management attributed that to increased costs related to AI product development. CFO Michael Scarpelli told analysts, \"We view these investments as key to unlocking additional revenue opportunities in the future.\"\nGoing forward, the data lake\u00a0and data warehousing markets are projected to expand at 24% annually through 2030. Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Snowflake to grow sales at 23% annually over the next three years. Personally, I think that leaves room for upside if Snowflake is successful in its AI ambitions. But even if Wall Street is correct, the current valuation of 14.4 times sales is quite reasonable. Indeed, Snowflake has never traded at a cheaper valuation.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

But Google Cloud Platform is actually gaining market share in cloud infrastructure and platform services, accounting for 11% of spending in the fourth quarter, up from 10%\u00a0in the prior year.\nAlphabet is integrating its latest AI model, Gemini, into both ecosystems to boost growth. For instance, Gemini powers AI overviews designed to make Google Search more engaging and streamlines ad campaign creation with a conversational interface. Gemini also automates tasks in Workspace applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, and it can be fine-tuned by Google Cloud customers to create custom generative AI applications.\nAlphabet is particularly well positioned to monetize AI through its cloud computing business. Forrester Research recently ranked Google Cloud Platform as the leader in AI infrastructure solutions,\u00a0awarding the company the highest scores in current offering, development strategy, and market share. Forrester also ranked Google's Gemini as the leading large language model, ahead of OpenAI's GPT-4.\nAlphabet reported encouraging financial results in the first quarter. Revenue increased 15% to $80.5 billion due to strong momentum in cloud computing and modest growth in advertising. Meanwhile, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income jumped 57% to $23.7 billion, helped along by cost-optimization efforts, like headcount reductions and the integration of different business teams.\nGoing forward, Wall Street analysts estimate that Alphabet will grow earnings per share at 17.2% annually over the next three to five years. That forecast makes its current valuation of 26.7 times earnings seem reasonable. From that price, I think Alphabet can outperform the S&P 500 over the next three to five years.\nSnowflake is best known as a cloud data warehouse, a system that stores data optimized for queries and business intelligence. In fact, Forrester recently recognized the company as a leader among cloud data warehousing platforms. But Snowflake also functions as a data lake, a system that stores raw data for analytics and AI, and its platform supports data sharing.\nBeyond that core functionality, Snowflake provides several adjacent solutions. Its Snowpark developer framework supports the training of AI models, its Cortex service brings generative AI and machine learning models to Snowflake data, and its Native Application Framework allows businesses to build and deploy applications on the platform. Snowflake is unique in its ability to support those features on a single platform across multiple public clouds.\nThe company reported mixed first-quarter financial results. Its customer count jumped 21% to 9,822, and the average existing customer spent 28% more. In turn, revenue increased 33% to $829 million on strong growth in core storage and analytics capabilities. But management also mentioned encouraging momentum with newer products. More than half of customers now use Snowpark, and over 750 customers have already used Cortex (which launched in May).\nThe bottom line was more troubling. Non-GAAP operating margin contracted one percentage point in the first quarter, and non-GAAP net income declined 7% to $0.14 per diluted share. Snowflake also lowered its full-year margin guidance, but management attributed that to increased costs related to AI product development. CFO Michael Scarpelli told analysts, \"We view these investments as key to unlocking additional revenue opportunities in the future.\"\nGoing forward, the data lake\u00a0and data warehousing markets are projected to expand at 24% annually through 2030. Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Snowflake to grow sales at 23% annually over the next three years. Personally, I think that leaves room for upside if Snowflake is successful in its AI ambitions. But even if Wall Street is correct, the current valuation of 14.4 times sales is quite reasonable. Indeed, Snowflake has never traded at a cheaper valuation.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "How Apple's AI Update Was Bad News for Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The wait is over. There was considerable anticipation leading up to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) this week. In particular, investors were eager to learn about Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy. They now have some answers.\nAt Alphabet's Google Cloud Next event in April, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was near the center of attention. It was a much different story at Apple's WWDC. Here's how Apple's AI update was bad news for Nvidia.\nApple and Nvidia have been neck-and-neck in claiming the No. 2 spot behind Microsoft among the largest companies based on market cap. In the aftermath of the WWDC, Apple has opened up a bigger lead over Nvidia.\nI think one major story from this week's WWDC is that Apple is committed to winning in the edge AI market. Edge AI is the deployment of AI on connected devices at the \"edge\" of networks.\nApple Intelligence (the name for Apple's generative AI integration with its newest iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems) represents a key step forward for Apple in edge AI. CEO Tim Cook said, \"Our unique approach combines generative AI with a user's personal context to deliver truly helpful intelligence. And it can access that information in a completely private and secure way to help users do the things that matter most to them.\"\nApple's version of generative AI will primarily run on its devices rather than in the cloud. Where is Nvidia's tremendous growth coming from these days? Primarily from selling GPUs for use in cloud data centers. Sure, Nvidia offers solutions for edge AI. However, it isn't anywhere in the picture with Apple's strategy. And Apple's more than 2.2 billion devices worldwide could put it in the driver's seat in the edge AI market.\nDidn't Apple reveal that some of Apple Intelligence will run on the cloud? Yep. However, that won't help Nvidia.\nThere were two words in Apple's update that Nvidia almost certainly didn't want to hear: \"Apple silicon.\" Apple said its Private Cloud Compute for handling more complex requests will \"run on servers powered by Apple silicon.\"\nThat's a stark contrast to other leading cloud services. Amazon Web Services uses Nvidia's GPUs. So do Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. But Apple won't.\nIt's even possible that Amazon, Microsoft, and Google could be inspired by Apple's decision to use its own silicon to accelerate their own internal chip programs. All three major cloud service providers have their own AI chips but still rely primarily on Nvidia's GPUs.\nNvidia would have undoubtedly loved for Apple to have used its GPUs in its Private Cloud Compute. That would have reinforced the view of Nvidia as the undisputed leader in AI chips for data centers. Nvidia would have also probably preferred that more of Apple's generative AI functionality run in the cloud instead of on the devices.\nNeither happened. That's bad news in one sense for Nvidia. However, it's not horrible news by any stretch of the imagination despite Nvidia's shares falling a little this week.\nApple's AI approach shouldn't diminish the skyrocketing demand for Nvidia's GPUs. I suspect that will be true even if Amazon, Microsoft, and Google follow in Apple's footsteps by increasing the use of their custom AI chips.\nNvidia's fortunes remain largely in the company's control. As long as Nvidia continues to out-innovate the competition, it will stay on top of the AI chip market.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Lu Wang and Isabelle Lee ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- One of the world\u2019s biggest tech ETFs looks poised for a shake-up after Nvidia Corp. catapulted past Apple Inc. in size.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for \u2018Simulation of Keyboard Activity\u2019\nSouthwest Plane Plunged Within 400 Feet of Ocean Near Hawaii\nBump Stock Ban Tossed Out by Supreme Court in Gun-Rights Win\nTesla Investors Get Behind Musk\u2019s Fight for $56 Billion Pay Deal\nApple to \u2018Pay\u2019 OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash\nThanks to diversification rules, the $67 billion Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (ticker XLK) has held way fewer Nvidia shares for months now while the AI giant continues to soar. Currently, the chipmaker makes up roughly 6% of the fund\u2019s assets, compared with 21% for the S&P 500 Information Technology Index \u2014 spurring XLK to underperform big time this year.\nNow that Nvidia has raced past Apple in value, its ownership in XLK could undergo a drastic elevation when the ETF carries out a quarterly rebalance near the end of this month, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\nThe ETF will reflect the full heft of the semiconductor pioneer\u2019s capitalization \u2014 if Nvidia keeps its edge over Apple on Friday, the day when each XLK member\u2019s preliminary representation is determined. In the process, Apple\u2019s weight, currently at 21% of the fund, could drop to as little as 4.5%, thanks again to this diversification rule.\nSuch a shuffle could prompt XLK\u2019s manager, State Street Global Advisors, to load up on Nvidia shares to the tune of $10 billion, Bloomberg calculations show. Meanwhile, the fund would need to dump around $11 billion of Apple shares. That\u2019s not a petty transaction, particularly for Apple. Over the past three months, the stock has changed hands at a rate of $11 billion a day.\n\u201cIf Nvidia is larger on the reference date, they will have to flip the weights and sell Apple,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart. \u201cThey will do whatever is required by the rules,\u201d he added. \u201cThey were being forced to make even larger relative sales of a stock in the past.\u201d\nA State Street spokesperson said the firm will follow any revisions as set by the index methodology. A spokesperson for S&P Dow Jones Indices declined to comment on potential index changes and referred Bloomberg News to the methodology.\nIt\u2019s the latest example of how the relentless rally in tech behemoths is pushing up against the limit of regulations that date back more than 80 years. Established to protect investors following the stock market crash and the Great Depression, the diversification rules can be punishing in a lopsided market.\nAt issue is a cap on how much a stock\u2019s impact is allowed in XLK. While the fund is designed to mimic returns in the traditional S&P 500 tech sub-index over the long run, it tracks a version of the sector gauge that\u2019s kept by S&P and follows the practice of limiting member weights to avoid violating diversification rules.\nSimilar restrictions last year spurred the overseer of the Nasdaq 100 to conduct a special rebalance to keep index-tracking funds in compliance with the rules. Under those rules, the combined representation of the largest companies \u2014 those making up roughly 5% or more of a diversified fund \u2014 can\u2019t add up to more than 50%.\nWhen this rule is breached, indexes such as the Nasdaq 100 tend to trim the top holdings proportionally. XLK\u2019s methodology works differently. When a number of stocks are not in compliance, the smallest of those gets clipped.\nIn the previous two quarterly rebalances, Nvidia\u2019s weight in XLK was cut to 4.5% each time because its value trailed Microsoft Corp. and Apple, and was therefore more exposed to a reduction. That happened even as the chipmaker made up 17% of the regular S&P 500 tech index in March and 11% in December.\nAs a result, XLK suffered from not owning enough Nvidia, with the latter surging around 145% year-to-date amid the AI frenzy. The ETF has lagged behind the traditional S&P 500 tech gauge by 4.5 percentage points this quarter \u2014 on track for the widest dispersion since 2001.\nIn the event that a switch does happen, Chris Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, is more focused at the implications on how XLK may fit in an investor\u2019s portfolio.\n\u201cThe potential switch of sizing up of Nvidia and sizing down of Apple would make a very significant characteristic change to XLK,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have an ETF that is more semis-oriented and more momentum-orientated. It is changing the characteristic, which means it may change the way the ETF trades.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGrieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon\nIsraeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War\nThe World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics\nHow to Cool Down Parks in Hot Cities\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Imagine yourself in 2014. Back then, there was an up-and-coming chip company called Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), with graphics processors that were popular in video game applications.\nThings weren't bad, as video games were a growth industry, though cyclical. But 2014 was a tough year. In fact, in the second quarter of that year, Nvidia posted a revenue decline.\nWith those types of results, investors might have viewed Nvidia as an already-mature company. But those looking more deeply might have learned of Nvidia's new software platform called CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), which enabled Nvidia graphics chips to execute data processing in a parallel format. That meant many calculations could be executed simultaneously, whereas CPUs calculated data in a linear fashion.\nSome hypothesized that CUDA-enabled GPUs would one day overtake the mighty CPU as the main type of data center computing processor. Had one placed a modest $1,000 bet on that scenario, here's how much you would have made.\nA modest $1,000 investment in Nvidia in June of 2014 would have grown (dividends included) to a stunning $280,600 today! That's a 280-bagger, amounting to a 27,960% gain.\nTwo things happened. The capabilities of generative artificial intelligence technology became apparent following the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022 and Nvidia's GPUs became the best way to execute the massive number of calculations needed to train these models. As a result, enterprises began falling over themselves to buy these coveted chips.\nThat sent Nvidia's revenue up 262% last quarter to $26 billion, with net margin surging to 58.5%. For reference, in Q2 2014, Nvidia made just $977 million in revenue, with adjusted (non-GAAP) net margins of 13.6%.\nAs Nvidia shows, investing in just one incredible growth stock early on can make up for dozens of mediocre stock picks and make a huge difference to your financial security and independence.

        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) released fiscal 2025 first-quarter results (for the three months ending April 28, 2024) on May 22, and there was a lot to like about the semiconductor giant's quarterly report as it crushed estimates and delivered better-than-expected guidance thanks to the terrific demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\nThe company's revenue shot up a stunning 262% year over year to $26 billion while earnings jumped a massive 461% to $6.12 per share. Both numbers were better than what Wall Street was looking for. The data-center business, which produced 87% of Nvidia's revenue, played a stellar role in this growth. After all, Nvidia's data-center revenue jumped a whopping 427% year over year to a record $22.6 billion last quarter thanks to its dominant position in the AI chip market.\nHowever, there was another business that reported healthy growth of 45% from the year-ago period. Though this business is currently producing a small portion of Nvidia's top line, the immense opportunity in this segment indicates that it could move the needle in a bigger way in the future. Let's take a closer look at it.\nNvidia's professional-visualization business -- which includes sales of professional graphics cards used in workstations and its Omniverse platform that helps users make virtual designs of real-world objects -- gained impressive traction in the previous quarter.\nMore specifically, Nvidia's professional-visualization revenue increased to $427 million in the previous quarter from $295 million in the prior-year period. On the company's latest earnings-conference call, Nvidia management attributed this healthy growth to the growing demand for its Omniverse digital-twin solutions.\nAccording to CFO Colette Kress:\nCompanies are using Omniverse to digitalize their workflows. Omniverse power digital twins enable Wistron, one of our manufacturing partners, to reduce end-to-end production cycle times by 50% and defect rates by 40%. And BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is adopting Omniverse for virtual factory planning and retail configurations.\nIt is worth noting that Nvidia has built a solid base of customers for its Omniverse digital-twin solutions, including the likes of Mercedes-Benz and BMW. And now, the company is looking to expand the reach of the Omniverse platform by offering it as a platform-as-a-service. Developers and enterprises will be able to use Nvidia's Omniverse platform with a subscription for creating digital twins, training autonomous vehicles, and testing and simulating robots.\nMore specifically, Nvidia is offering cloud-based application-programming interfaces (APIs) that will allow developers to integrate its software for creating digital-twin applications. The good part is that its Omniverse Cloud APIs are already being offered by multiple industrial-software companies such as Microsoft, Siemens, Rockwell Automation, Ansys, and Cadence, among others.\nThese moves should allow Nvidia to capitalize on the growing digitalization within the industrial space. Mordor Intelligence estimates that the manufacturing industry's digital transformation could generate a whopping $876 billion in revenue in 2029. The digital-twin market, on the other hand, is expected to generate $240 billion in annual revenue in 2035 compared to an estimated $13 billion this year.\nAll this indicates that Nvidia's professional-visualization business has tremendous room for growth in the future and could very well become an additional catalyst for the company along with its data-center and gaming businesses.\nIn its investor day presentation a couple of years ago, Nvidia management said it sees a $150 billion addressable opportunity for its Omniverse enterprise-software platform, along with another $150 billion for related hardware. The company's fiscal Q1 professional-visualization revenue suggests that it is on track to generate annual revenue of $1.7 billion from this market in fiscal 2025.\nNvidia, therefore, seems to be at the beginning of a massive growth curve in professional visualization. Meanwhile, the company estimates that its total addressable market (TAM) across all of its businesses stands at a whopping $1 trillion. Again, that's not surprising considering that it is serving fast-growing markets such as AI chips.\nWith Nvidia's revenue expected to nearly double in the current fiscal year to $120 billion, it can be said that the company has tapped just over 10% of its TAM. As such, there is a good chance that Nvidia could remain a high-growth company in the long run, making it an ideal bet for investors looking to add a growth stock to their portfolios.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nBlackwell platform chips are expected to enter the market in the third quarter and take up just under 10 per cent of the high-end graphics processing unit (GPU) market, according to a note by Taipei-based research firm TrendForce.\n\"Nvidia is proactively pushing its AI technologies to meet global demand,\" said Arisa Liu, a semiconductor research director at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, adding that Nvidia's new chip architecture, Rubin, will adopt Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)'s 4-nanometre process.\nMany of the semiconductors and servers that enable AI breakthroughs are assembled or made by TSMC.\nSilicon Valley-based Nvidia is on track to overtake Apple as the world's second-most valuable technology company, with its shares having surged over 120 per cent to US$1,095.95 since the beginning of this year.\nHowever, the chip designer's business in China is facing mounting challenges amid US export restrictions on advanced semiconductor technology and rising competition from local firms led by Huawei Technologies.\nNvidia's most powerful Blackwell line, including the B100, B200 and GB200, adds to a growing list of GPU models that are barred by the US from being shipped to China, the company's third-largest market by revenue last year.\nWashington's embargo and Nvidia's continuous technological advancement will put China further behind the world's leading edge in AI infrastructure, according to industry analysts and professionals.\nWhile China has earmarked 344 billion yuan (US$47.5 billion) for the latest phase of its state-backed semiconductor investment fund to speed up its national self-sufficiency drive, many industry professionals said limited GPU choices, lack of access to advanced chip manufacturing, and an underdeveloped software ecosystem have made it difficult to rely on domestic AI solutions.\nHuawei and Chinese start-up Biren Technology, which produce some of the country's most reputable home-grown AI chips, are both on the US trade blacklist, forcing them to turn to domestic foundries to produce their chips using less advanced manufacturing processes.\nChina's top foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), which is also sanctioned by the US, faces bottlenecks in adding more advanced capacities needed to make AI chips.\nA Huawei flagship store in Shenzhen, China's southern Guangdong province.

Photo: AFP>\nHuawei's Ascend 910B chip, which has been adopted by various industries in China, is only able to achieve about 60 to 70 per cent of Nvidia A100's performance, according to multiple computation experiments.\nMany home-grown chips are behind Nvidia's in performance and stability, according to one researcher at China's server maker H3C, who said that the lag affects China's development of large AI models. The person, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, said H3C tested various GPUs, including those from Cambricon, Iluvatar Corex and Huawei.\nHuawei is striving to improve its technology. The Shenzhen-based giant, which staged a comeback in the 5G smartphone market last year using chips produced by SMIC, is developing a 5-nm process node using deep ultraviolet lithography systems and a technology known as self-aligned quadruple patterning, according to a Bloomberg report in March.\nMore advanced chip-making technologies can improve performances and lower power consumption of high-end chips.\nHowever, it was not easy for China to achieve 7-nm chip production, and there is only a small likelihood that China can progress quickly to more advanced 5nm or 3nm nodes, said Zhang Pingan, CEO of Huawei Cloud, during a recent China Mobile conference.\nHuawei's ecosystem is also less developed than Nvidia's CUDA, which has become an essential AI development platform used by some 5 million developers globally. Huawei's equivalent, in contrast, has a much smaller use base worldwide.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Author": "  Jowi Morales ",
        "Text": "The recent AI boom has paid dividends for Nvidia, with the company reportedly shipping 3.76 million data center GPUs in 2023 alone. This is over a million more graphics processors than it shipped to this market in 2022, growing its sales by over 42%. According to HPCwire, these numbers show that Nvidia has retained its 98% market share of the data center GPU market in 2023 from the previous year.\nAside from its lead in the data center market, Nvidia has also cornered 88% of the desktop GPU market, with the next-generation RTX 50-series expected to arrive later this year. Because of this massive demand, the company has seen record growth, with Nvidia hitting $60.9 billion in revenue in 2023 \u2014 a full 126% higher than in 2022.\nWe\u2019ve seen this growth despite the U.S. ban on Nvidia\u2019s exports of AI and other advanced chips to China. Furthermore, the company still had to deal with an AI GPU shortage as TSMC\u2019s output could not keep pace with demand.\nNevertheless, TSMC predicted that Nvidia will become the world\u2019s largest semiconductor firm in 2023. As of 24Q1, Nvidia is already in third place among the world\u2019s most valuable companies and will likely overtake Apple soon.\nBut even if Nvidia has cornered the data center market, it cannot rest on its laurels. AMD is on track to deliver vastly more power-efficient chips \u2014 something that Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPU is struggling with, as it consumes 700 watts when running at capacity. Intel is also touting its Gaudi 3 AI processor which will cost half the price of the H100: a tempting offer for companies that don\u2019t want to spend over $30,000 per H100 card.\nAside from the typical semiconductor firms, we also see data center providers joining in the data center hardware race. Microsoft revealed the Maia 100 GPU last year, which it made for AI applications, and is likely one of the chips it will use in its upcoming $100-billion data center project. Even Amazon and Google have their own homegrown chips, with the former making custom chips for AWS, and the latter planning to use its own data center server processors as early as next year.\nHowever, Nvidia claims that these chips are still not as powerful as its GPUs in AI performance. They won't be as adaptable, either. So, even though other firms might offer alternatives to Nvidia, the company\u2019s GPUs will likely stay on top in the coming years.\n"

In saying that, the stock appears stretched to the upside, given it trades around 56% above a multi-month uptrend line and the relative strength index (RSI) indicates overbought conditions with a reading over the 70 threshold.\nDuring periods of profit-taking, monitor if buyers can defend the uptrend line, currently sitting at around $87. A breakdown below this level could see the shares test the top of a prior consolidation area near $50.\nSimilar to Nvidia, Microsoft shares have continued to trend strongly upwards since finding support around the 200-day MA in October last year. However, a key difference is that the Microsoft chart indicate less overbought conditions. The price trades within close proximity to an uptrend line extending back to the October low, with the RSI indicator giving a reading below 70. Although the lower RSI suggests the shares have room to move higher it also indicates the stock has less momentum than Nvidia.\nLooking ahead, it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on how price responds to the uptrend line. A failure to hold this key technical indicator could act as a catalyst for a decline to two prior record highs in the stock around $350.\nApple shares traded within a narrow 12-month channel before staging a volume-backed breakout earlier this month after unveiling Apple Intelligence, the iPhone maker\u2019s personalized artificial intelligence (AI) to be installed on its devices. Although, the RSI indicator has recently moved into overbought territory, the stock has ample room to continue moving higher given its extended consolidation before the breakout.\nInvestors can project a potential price target using the measuring principle. To do this, calculate the distance between the channel\u2019s lower and upper trendlines and add that amount to the breakout point. For example, adding $31 to the $197 breakout point forecasts a price target of $228.\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

The H200 is Nvidia\u2019s latest GPU and has capabilities that allow it to better cope with large data sets needed for AI, the company has said.\nThe fund\u2019s launch plan comes as Asia faces a shortage of computing power for high-end technology processes, while investment is flowing into for data centers as demand for AI capabilities grows. The world\u2019s biggest companies are set to spend up to $60 billion over the next couple of years on data centers in Southeast Asia as the region embraces video streaming, online shopping and generative AI.\nClients would include companies based in the Asia-Pacific and as well as government or related departments in Taiwan, according to Cheung. Revenue would be generated by charging an hourly fee to access the servers with the chips, Cheung added. Venture Hub was founded in late 2022 and currently has six employees, including Cheung.\n\u201cThe servers and the Nvidia chips depreciate with time,\u201d said Cheung. \u201cThat\u2019s why investors are keen to use private credit as an investment strategy: It\u2019s the most practical way to enjoy the short-term returns while not having to buy the asset themselves,\u201d he added.\nVenture Hub has reached out to family offices in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan with a number expressing interest, Cheung said.\nH200 GPUs can help data centers accelerate processes including machine learning and high-performance computing, Nvidia has said \u2014 technology needed to handle reams of data faster.\nThe earliest expected launch date for the fund is end of August, Cheung said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

On Jun 5, the semiconductor giant hit yet another milestone after its shares jumped 5% to take its market value past $3 trillion for the first time, becoming the second-biggest company in the United States.\nNIVIDA\u2019s new milestone added fuel to the Nasdaq rally, helping the tech-heavy index close at 17,187.92, hitting a fresh all-time high. Moreover, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) jumped 4.5% to finish at 5,347.44, also registering an all-time high.\nNVIDIA\u2019s rally isn\u2019t a recent phenomenon. The company has been a market leader in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and has been at the heart of the boom surrounding the space.\nIts shares have soared 211.5% in the past 12 months and 146.4% year to date.\nWednesday\u2019s rally follows the unveiling of NVIDIA\u2019s new AI chip architecture called \u201cRubin\u201d by its Jensen Huang at an industry conference in Taipei.

        "Title": "Nvidia and Chipotle Are Splitting Their Stocks. Could These Two Companies Be Next?",
        "Author": "  Jennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "June is a popular month for stock splits. Two recent high-profile ones were Amazon and Shopify, both in June 2022. The two newest June stock splits are Nvidia, which split its stock 10-for-1 last week, and Chipotle Mexican Grill, which is set to split on June 26 at 50-for-1.\nWhen a company splits its stock, it implies that it has grown tremendously and that management expects even more growth. A high price tag could be a barrier to entry for some investors or at least looks intimidating to investors who don't have four figures to invest. A lower price per share could appear more attractive.\nStock-split stocks get loads of attention, and stock prices usually jump after the announcement. They often jump after the split, as well, making them even more attractive. With high stock prices and rising charts, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) could be next.\nCostco operates a paid membership model that generates high sales growth and deep profits. It's a win-win setup for the company and its members: Costco gets a recurring revenue stream with its fees, as well as reliable traffic and volume, and shoppers get the lowest prices for their favorite products.\nCompanies often tout expanding gross margins, which are usually the basis for increasing profits. Costco, conversely, doesn't try to get its gross margins to be high -- it boasts very low gross margins. It doesn't inflate prices to send more money to the bottom line. Instead, it marks up products to cover associated costs and relies on high volume for sales increases. The fees are what comprise most of its net income.\nConsider its margin compared with Walmart, Target, and Kroger.\nIt's a unique and powerful model that has led to strong performance over time and incredible shareholder value.\nInvestors shouldn't be worried about continued opportunities. Costco only operates 879 warehouses in total, with 606 in the U.S. It's not even in every state yet and is just getting started in many international regions, including China.\nIt's also planning to raise the membership fee at some point. It's already past the average time period when it usually hikes the fee, which is about every five years.\nManagement feels the company is performing quite well without it right now, and it would add extra pressure to its already pressed consumer base. The company is focused on creating value for shoppers and shareholders, which will lead to consumer loyalty and trickle down from sales to profits.\nInvestors have been so enthused about Costco stock that its valuation has hit record highs recently. Costco hasn't split its stock in nearly 25 years, but as its price surges with no sign of stopping, it could be another tool in management's arsenal. Management is committed to shareholder value creation, and a stock split would meet that goal.\nMercadoLibre is an e-commerce giant based in Latin America. It presents similar opportunities to Amazon when it was in its early stages.\nThe company's stock has already delivered incredible gains for investors -- up 5,500% since it went public -- and trades at a four-figure price. The stock has never split, but as it continues to demonstrate high growth with ample opportunity to keep it up, it could be on management's radar.\nMercadoLibre's main business is e-commerce, and that segment maintains very strong sales growth. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) increased 71% (currency neutral) year over year in the 2024 first quarter, and the company continues to refine its process to become more efficient and capture greater market share.\nThat results in a flywheel effect: As MercadoLibre's e-commerce service gets better, more customers rely on it for more of their needs, boosting its economies of scale. MercadoLibre services a large population with a low e-commerce penetration rate but a high e-commerce growth rate, implying that this business has a long growth runway.\nMercadoLibre's newer fintech business is growing even faster. Total payment volume increased 86% over last year in the first quarter. The company has expanded this segment from a digital payments app into a financial services app with credit cards and other products and is opening its first full-service digital bank in Mexico.\nMercadoLibre is an excellent business with many opportunities. As the price keeps climbing, management may decide it's time for a split.\nThere's evidence that stock-split stocks do post gains after their splits, but the correlation is more likely to be with the company's excellent performance rather than the split itself. If you decide to buy a stock that's splitting or might split soon, do it for the outstanding performance and long-term opportunity that typically accompanies a great stock-split stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Costco Wholesale wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Diversify Beyond Nvidia: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio",
        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Whether right or wrong, Nvidia has become the face of artificial intelligence (AI) on Wall Street. It's not a fluke; Nvidia's growth exploded since early last year, and the stock's gains have made it a household name among investors.\nStill, it's worth pointing out that AI goes far beyond one company. You can buy and hold a stock like Nvidia, but don't dismiss the potential upside of some smaller companies that have the ingredients to become big winners down the road.\nHere are three AI\u00a0stocks you can add to your long-term portfolio:\nData is arguably the foundation of how AI works, so it would make sense that companies that best use their data might have a competitive advantage. That's the quick and dirty pitch for Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR).\nThe company builds custom software applications on its platforms -- Foundry, Gotham, and AIP -- that help organizations analyze their data in real time. Palantir works closely with the U.S. government, its allies, and the private sector, where expansion is happening quickly.\nAIP, or its Artificial Intelligence Platform, unlocked a new level of growth and could be the long-term catalyst that makes Palantir one of the world's largest businesses over the coming decades. AIP helps develop and deploy AI applications for government and businesses.\nThe value of AIP is evident throughout Palantir. Growth in commercial customers has accelerated to 69% year over year in the first quarter, mainly due to interest in AIP.\nPalantir is growing and profitable, with a balance sheet of $3.9 billion in cash and zero debt. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow at an annualized rate of 27% over the next three to five years.\nThe company still has just 262 commercial customers in the U.S. That figure could grow for a long time if it continues to show the value of its AI technology for businesses.\nAn organization's data isn't just sitting there, ready to go. Companies must securely store it, which creates a massive opportunity for Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW).\nThe company is a cloud-based data storage and analytics platform that can make it easy for customers to store their data and access it whenever they choose. Just think of data's various formats and sources; referencing data quickly becomes a matter of finding the needle in the haystack. That's where Snowflake helps.\nSnowflake has a usage-based billing model that enables customers to scale its products to their needs. And since data grows exponentially, companies should increase their use of Snowflake as their data expands. As proof, the business has a robust net revenue retention rate of 128%.\nAlong with that organic revenue expansion is the opportunity to add new clients. Snowflake has roughly 9,822 customers today, and with 1.7 million C-corporations in the U.S. alone, there's a tremendous long-term runway. In all, it seems likely to enjoy many years of double-digit growth.\nCybersecurity steadily moved toward the forefront of many businesses' priorities. Protecting data and digital assets is no longer optional because the potential costs of failing are too high -- the average breach causes millions of dollars in damages.\nSo companies are looking to next-generation security providers like CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD). The company operates a cloud-based platform that secures end points, cloud workloads, identities, and data. The platform adapts to real-time threats, making it far more effective than outdated technologies like antivirus protections.\nThe proof of how good CrowdStrike is lies in its stellar financial metrics. Annual revenue multiplied more than sevenfold over the past five years to $3 billion.\nThe company is also very profitable. CrowdStrike is converting 32% of its revenue to free cash flow, reinforcing a solid balance sheet that has $3.5 billion in cash versus $742 million in debt. Analysts believe it will grow earnings by 22% annually for the next three to five years.\nThe company has become famous for expanding via new product modules. Its addressable market is worth $100 billion today and could expand to $225 billion by the decade's end. That's a tremendous opportunity for a business doing just over $3 billion in sales today.\nInvestors should consider buying shares slowly because strong fundamentals have earned the stock a lofty valuation at 79 times earnings, which is expensive -- even for a company of CrowdStrike's caliber.\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split is in effect, giving investors nine additional shares for every one that they already own.\nShares declined slightly to $119.77 shortly after the market open on Monday.\nNvidia\u2019s stock price has more than doubled this year after more than tripling in 2023 and it's now the third most valuable company in the S&P 500. The meteoric ride allowed Nvidia to briefly surpass Apple last week as the second most valuable company in the U.S. Nvidia surpassed $3 trillion in market value.\nThe chipmaker has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications. The company's revenue more than tripled in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier.\nNvidia, which has positioned itself as one of the most prominent players in AI, has been producing some eye-popping numbers. Here\u2019s a look:\n$3.011 Trillion\nNvidia\u2019s total market value as of Wednesday. Earlier this year, it passed Amazon and Alphabet to become the third most valuable public company, behind Microsoft ($3.168 trillion) and Apple ($3.029 trillion). The company was valued at around $418 billion two years ago.\n$147 billion\nThat\u2019s the one-day increase in Nvidia\u2019s market value on Wednesday.\n10 for 1\nThe company's 10-for-1 stock split went into effect at the close of trading on Friday. The move gives each investor nine additional shares for every share they already own.\nCompanies often conduct stock splits to make their shares more affordable for investors. Nvidia\u2019s stock closed Wednesday at $1,224.40 and it's just one of 11 companies in the S&P 500 with a share price over $1,000.\n$26 billion\nRevenue for Nvidia\u2019s most recent fiscal quarter. That\u2019s more than triple the $7.2 billion it reported in the same period a year ago. Wall Street expects Nvidia to bring in revenue of $117 billion in fiscal 2025, which would be close to double its revenue in 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.\n53.4%\nNvidia\u2019s estimated net margin, or the percentage of revenue that gets turned in profit. Looked at another way, about 53 cents of every $1 in revenue Nvidia took in last year went to its bottom line. By comparison, Apple\u2019s net margin was 26.3% in its most recent quarter and Microsoft\u2019s was 36.4%. Both those companies have significantly higher revenue than Nvidia, however.\n"

        "Title": "Why Nvidia, Super Micro Computer, Dell, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Rallied This Week",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Much of the market rally this year has been driven by excitement regarding artificial intelligence (AI) and the growing number of potential applications for the technology. Conservative estimates place the market value of generative AI in the neighborhood of $1 trillion, while others are much higher. Companies at the leading edge of technology -- those providing the semiconductors and servers necessary to integrate AI -- have seen demand for their products soar, helping fuel the rally.\nWith that as a backdrop, AI-centric server maker Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) surged 12.2% this week, computer and server specialist Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) jumped 11.1%, memory and storage chipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) climbed 2.6%, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) climbed 2% as of 12:52 p.m. ET on Thursday, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nA number of intriguing developments helped push these AI stocks higher.\nThe biggest driver in the AI space over the past week has been Nvidia. It's well known that when shares of the chipmaker move, many other stocks in the AI space tend to follow suit -- whether there's company-specific news or not. And there's plenty going on with Nvidia stock. The company completed its high-profile stock split last week, which generated a great deal of excitement among investors.\nNvidia also received a bullish update from Wall Street, adding additional fuel to the fire. The notable commentary came courtesy of Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann, who reiterated his buy rating on the stock and increased his price target to a Street-high $200. For those keeping track at home, this represents potential upside of 48% compared to Tuesday's closing price and would give Nvidia a market cap of nearly $5 trillion.\nDemand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) has been off the charts and market watchers are turning over every rock to see which AI-related company will be next to see its profits soar.\nThere were other developments in the space that helped fuel the AI rally.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring issued positive commentary about Dell, calling the stock a \"Top Pick\" after meeting with the company's management. The analyst went on to say that Dell would continue to outperform in 2024 on the back of its strong competitive position and the secular tailwinds represented by the growing market demand for AI-centric servers. Woodring maintained his outperform rating and $155 price target on the stock.\nFor its part, Micron got a vote of confidence from analysts at Wells Fargo, who maintained their buy rating on the stock, while increasing their price target to $190. That represents 24% upside compared to the stock's closing price on Tuesday. The analysts suggest the company is capable of generating earnings per share of $15, significantly higher than analysts' consensus estimates, which currently call for $8.87 for 2025.\nOn another front, Elon Musk also provided a boost for Dell and Supermicro, revealing that the two companies will be providing servers for AI start-up xAI, which is in the process of building a supercomputer to support its AI efforts. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the enigmatic CEO wrote, \"Dell is assembling half of the racks that are going into the supercomputer that xAI is building.\" In response to a question from another poster asking, \"Whose [sic] building the other half?\", Musk replied, \"SMC [Super Micro Computer].\"\nThere's an argument that each of these stocks represents a compelling opportunity. Micron, Super Micro Computer, and Dell are currently selling for 4 times, 2 times, and 1 times forward sales, a reasonable price to pay for three companies poised to profit from the accelerating adoption of AI.\nNvidia is the outlier. Thanks to the company's triple-digit sales and profit gains and the resulting stock price surge this year, the most widely used valuation metrics are useless. Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which takes that growth into account -- comes in at less than 1, the benchmark for an undervalued stock.\nTo be clear, the AI revolution is just getting started, and as such the stocks in the space will be even more volatile than usual. Investors don't want to miss out on one of the biggest opportunities in a generation, but many will buy and sell based on a whim and the latest rumors.\nThose wanting to profit from these strong secular tailwinds would be better served to buy a basket of the best AI stocks they can find and hold for the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Best Growth Stock To Buy Now According To Ray Dalio?",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other growth stocks.\nRay Dalio is one of the most successful investors in Wall Street's history. He has invested through his firm Bridgewater Associates, and according to Insider Monkey's research, Bridgewater had a 13F portfolio worth $19.7 billion as of Q1 2024 end. What's more, is that we also looked at the top hedge funds on Wall Street as part of our coverage of 23 Best Hedge Funds of All Time and discovered that Bridgewater Associates ranked in the top five due to its $30 billion in gains since inception.\nLooking at these, it's clear that Dalio and his firm must be doing at least something right. Ray Dalio is a macro player who not only loves to look at the broader trends that affect the economy, but he also loves diversification and selling stocks at the right time. This approach differs from several other hedge funds which choose to focus on specific companies or are proponents of buying and holding stocks for the long term. Dalio's strategy allows his fund to manage a changing economic and investment climate, as part of what is dubbed an All Weather Strategy.\nHowever, despite his success, 2024 has been a mixed year for Bridgewater Associates. The firm, currently headed by CEO Nir Bar Dea, is currently shaking things up as its Pure Alpha fund has lost 4% for the last four years. This fund also had one of its worst years in history in 2023, but the changes do appear to be making their mark. This is because in Q1, the fund posted 16% in returns which were higher than the 4.59% in gains made by global hedge funds.\nAs for Dalio, even though he has moved forward from directly overseeing Bridgewater's affairs, the investment guru regularly shares his wisdom with the world. He started 2024 by listing five key forces that will play a dominant theme in the investment environment this year. In a LinkedIn post, the billionaire shared that these forces are those that determine how the economy, the American and global political systems, forces of nature, and humanity's innovation work.\nWhile these forces are important for 2024, Dalio's life's work has focused on studying them over the course of the years and analyzing how they match similar trends in history. This makes his investment approach one of the most unique ones in the industry, and it appears to be yielding results as between 1991 and 2022, Bridgewater's Pure Alpha fund has delivered 11.4% in average annual returns.\nDalio is also one of the few investors in the world who takes a serious approach to studying history and understanding the implications on the broader investing environment. Ever eager to share his insights, the famed investor gave a talk at Columbia Business School in April. Commenting on the investment approach at Bridgewater, the billionaire shared his values, philosophy, and guiding beacons for the process. He started out by sharing that he began his career by trading commodities because they had low margin requirements which would let him make more money. The stock market crash of 1982, which forced Dalio to borrow $4,000 from his father to pay bills was also critical in formulating his investment approach. As we've mentioned above, diversification is a key theme of Dalio's All Weather Strategy, and the market crash influenced this approach:\nAnd the way I looked at the risk, is I said, it's like I, I, had a visual image that there's this jungle there. And if I can cross the jungle without getting killed to the other side I would be okay. But I have to go through that, and then, or I could stay on the safe life side. And not take those risks. And how would I do that? And that was a problem that I had to figure out. And I realized two things I needed to do. I needed to diversify because it's like my 15 uncorrelated returns stream mantra. I've realized that if I can have debts, 15 good uncorrelated return streams that I could reduce my risk by 80% with keeping the same expected returns.\nFinally, before we get to Ray Dalio's top growth stock picks, it's also important to understand why such stocks are important particularly in today's investment environment. US economic growth slowed down to 1.6% in Q1 from 2.4% in Q4 2023. At the same time, while the stock market has flourished on the AI front, other sectors have shown that persistently high inflation and tight credit conditions are making their mark. Since the economy is the sum product goods and services produced, firms whose revenue growth outpaces the consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 3.3% for May and the GDP growth are adding more customers to their top line instead of simply matching economic trends. Combining such stocks with the investment principles of the legendary Ray Dalio can help gain a better understanding of some of the market's top sectors.\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the top growth stocks that Ray Dalio and Bridgewater Associates have invested in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Ray Dalio's top growth stocks, we analyzed Bridgewater Associate's 13F filings for Q1 2024 and picked out ten stocks with strong fiscal year annual revenue growth among the top 80 stocks.\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nLatest Fiscal Year Annual Growth Rate: 125.85%\nBridgewater Associates' Q1 2024 Investment: $636 million\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is unsurprisingly the top revenue growth stock in Ray Dalio's portfolio. The firm's fortunes have soared due to the strong demand for its AI GPUs, which are industry leading when it comes to performance. One particular competitive advantage of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs is the CUDA platform. CUDA is the firm's proprietary software which enables users to use the chips for AI and other associated workloads. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also benefits from close ties to its customers, through which it guides them on the most efficient ways in which to use its products. CUDA sets it apart from products from smaller rival AMD, and it has allowed it to target some of the biggest firms in the world with its products.\nHowever, the fact that its products are pricey and that its biggest customers have adequate resources to develop their own AI chips means that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is constantly in a rush to launch the latest products and prove its mettle. Big ticket firms the likes of Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, and Facebook parent Meta have all designed and used their custom chips or are designing their own chips, even for AI workloads. This makes the future quite interesting for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nBaron Funds, whose largest investment position was in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as of Q1 2024 end, was cognizant of the firm's innovational lead when it comes to the well known S Curve. Here is what the fund said in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\nWe are early on the adoption S-curve \u2013 most companies are still in the proof of concept stage while very few are ready for production today. Hurdles in implementing AI include data prep, model adaptation and fine-tuning, and embedding of AI into existing workflows. There is a lot of innovation taking place to reducing these hurdles \u2013 from tools and infrastructure that help companies build and run AI models more easily, to third-party AI models exposed via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable companies to use them without building their own models from scratch. NVIDIA\u2019s ecosystem across developers, system integrators, cloud providers and independent software vendors, and internal software innovation are lowering these hurdles as well. For example, one of the most interesting announcements at the GTC conference were NVIDIA Inference Microservices \u2013 or NIMs, which are APIs to easily access open-source models (NVIDIA already has dozens of models available) without the need to worry about model optimizations, security, patching, or sending data to third parties. NIMs could ease AI adoption for enterprises while also driving incremental monetization for NVIDIA, priced at $4,500/GPU or at $1/GPU hour if used on the cloud, and increase the stickiness of NVIDIA\u2019s platform.\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best growth stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio. You can visit 10 Best Growth Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Ray Dalio to see the other growth stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Split Buy: Nvidia vs Broadcom",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) both announced 10-for-1 stock splits in recent times. That's because shares of these technology giants have surged, surpassing $1,000, as demand from artificial intelligence (AI) customers boosted revenue quarter after quarter. Nvidia completed its stock split earlier this month, and Broadcom's operation is set for next month.\nThe AI market may be in the early days of its growth story, and this is great news for both of these tech giants. Analysts predict that today's $200 billion market may surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade. This along with Nvidia's and Broadcom's own growth prospects make both companies compelling buys right now. But if you could choose just one of these stock split giants to buy right now, which one makes the better choice? Let's find out.\nNvidia sells the world's top-performing graphics processing unit (GPU), or the chip that powers some of the most crucial AI tasks like training and inferencing, for example. The tech giant also sells a wide range of products and services to help companies reach their AI goals and even aims to lead in new fields such as sovereign AI -- an area involving the development of AI by countries. Nvidia predicts sovereign AI, which brought in zero revenue last year, will bring in billions this year.\nAnd this is on top of an already bright growth picture. Nvidia's earnings have climbed in the triple digits quarter after quarter, and revenue has reached records thanks to the dominance of its chips and related products in the AI market. This could continue as Nvidia has promised to update the performance of its chips on an annual basis -- and the company has the financial strength to keep this innovation going.\nToday, Nvidia is more expensive than it was prior to its stock split even though the per-share price is lower. Stock splits lower the stock price but don't impact the market value of the company or the stock's valuation. So Nvidia is a solid buy today, but a pricier one than it was a few weeks ago.\nBroadcom is a semiconductor and networking expert, making the switches and other products used everywhere from our homes to our smartphones -- and growth has particularly taken off for Broadcom in AI datacenters. In the most recent quarter, AI revenue surged 280% to $3.1 billion, and the company predicts AI revenue will reach beyond $11 billion for the full year.\nThe company is a leader in the global Ethernet switch chips market, and this should be a driver of growth moving forward. Seven of the biggest eight AI clusters operating today use Broadcom Ethernet products, and the company predicts that next year all \"mega-scaled\" GPU clusters will use Ethernet.\nBroadcom earnings and share price also could gain thanks to its recent acquisition of VMware, a cloud software company. Including VMware, the company's revenue soared 43% to $12.5 billion (excluding VMware, the gain was only 12%) in the quarter.\nA look at valuation shows us Broadcom, like Nvidia, has become more expensive in recent times as its stock price has continued to gain. Still, the company makes a good buy at these levels.\nThe choice is difficult as both of these companies play key roles in the high-growth area of AI. But if I had to choose one stock to pick up right now, I would go for Broadcom. The stock is trading at a discount to Nvidia, which hasn't always been the case in the recent past, and its level in relation to forward earnings estimates is very reasonable.\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nAlso, it's important to keep in mind that Broadcom is just starting to see the positive impact of the VMware purchase -- as this gains momentum, we should see the results in earnings, and this could serve as a catalyst for stock performance.\nShould you buy Broadcom now or wait for the split? The split will offer you the opportunity to purchase a smaller stake in Broadcom without relying on fractional shares. Considering today's Broadcom price and the ratio of the split, the stock probably will trade for about $165 post-split. So, with just that amount, you can buy a share of Broadcom once the operation is complete.\nBut if you plan to invest the amount of Broadcom's current price (about $1,600) or more, there's no reason to wait. This top AI stock is one to get in on now and hold onto as the AI story develops.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Surprise! 3 Stocks That Are Outperforming Nvidia in 2024.",
        "Author": "  Rich Duprey ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has become the face of artificial intelligence and its stock has responded in kind. Shares are up 200% over the past year and over 800% since the release of ChatGPT, which sparked an AI tsunami. Yet there is a world of stocks that are outperforming Nvidia.\nWhile the technology sector provides opportunity with companies like Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) far outstripping the chipmaker\u2019s gains, investors should widen their lens even further.\nBelow are three fast-growing stocks that are outperforming Nvidia. They are not household names yet but could be a place to begin your search for long-term potential. Let\u2019s see whether these rocket ships are worth investing in today.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSource: Poravute Siriphiroon / Shutterstock.com\nWho knew raising chickens for eggs could be a monster growth market? Vital Farms (NASDAQ:VITL) proves it though, with its stock that are outperforming Nvidia in 2024. VITL stock is up 198% this year compared to a 149% gain by the AI chipmaker.\nBe careful where you get your data from though as Investor\u2019s Business Daily indicated Vital Farms rocketed over 1,800% last year. The egg producer, however, actually was up just 5% in 2023. The site, though, correctly notes the volatility Vital and other egg, poultry and meat producers face due to widespread illness outbreaks like avian flu. Vital suffered flock losses in 2022 and 2023 but says it can mitigate the damage because it has a network of 300 family farms it uses to supply its eggs.\nVital Farms is faring far better than industry giant Cal-Maine Foods (NASDAQ:CALM), which is the country\u2019s largest egg producer, producing 587,700 dozen eggs per hour at 43 different facilities. Its stock is up just 6% this year. In contrast, Vital sells over 8,000 dozen eggs per week at its retail partners.\nThe difference with Vital is it is an ethically sourced egg producer selling pasture-raised eggs. While there is a public misperception about what free-range, pasture-raised or cage-free really means, chickens are more humanely treated today than they were in the past when hens were crammed wing-to-beak in factories. Vital sells its eggs in 24,000 stores, a quarter of which are Whole Foods locations.\nYet it\u2019s hard to see Vital Farms holding onto its stock gains. It trades at 54 times trailing earnings, 4 times sales and 33x free cash flow (FCF), which is pricey for a commodities producer however ethical its practices.\nSource: pixinoo / Shutterstock.com\nWhen you fall as far as biotech Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) did there is little place to go but up. But the producer of Covid vaccines is soaring in 2024, with its stock outperforming Nividia with a 163% return. Virtually all of it came beginning in May when Novavax signed a partnership agreement with Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) to market its coronavirus vaccines.\nUnder terms of the deal, Sanofi will pay Novavax $500 million upfront plus milestone payments of $700 million that value the total agreement at $1.2 billion. Sanofi will also take a less than 5% minority ownership stake in the biotech.\nWhile that significantly de-risks an investment in Novavax, the problem is the market for Covid vaccines has greatly diminished. Growth has flatlined and Novavax has just a small percentage of the total.\nAccording to data from Oxford University and Y Combinator, some 917 million doses (including boosters) have been administered worldwide. That\u2019s only a few million more than in 2022. Of that number, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) account for 73% while Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) has another 17%. Novavax barely even registers with 310,000 doses administered. Barring another Covid outbreak, there doesn\u2019t appear to be much of a growth market here.\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\nThe third stock outperforming Nvidia this year is Redwire (NYSE:RDW), a leading manufacturer of space infrastructure for NASA, U.S. Space Force, the European Space Agency and space launch services company Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB). Its stock is up 152% so far this year.\nRedwire provides mission critical avionics, sensors, power generation, structures and more. It was recently selected by Rocket Labs to provide antennas and RF hardware for the Space Development Agency\u2019s constellation of satellites providing warfighters with unjammable communications. It also provided the cameras used by Intuitive Machine\u2019s (NASDAQ:LUNR) lunar lander.\nThe space stock went public in 2021 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) but splash landed hard afterward. It wasn\u2019t until last year that it was able to gain altitude again. It has been growing since, especially this year. Just last month it was awarded a contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for its SabreSat very-low-earth-orbit satellite.\nAlthough still producing losses on a GAAP basis, Redwire looks positioned for long-term profitability. As it just produced positive FCF for the first time, it is a foundation upon which to grow.\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio: 10 Best Stocks to Buy. Since Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer in his latest program talked about discipline during short-term market rallies and emphasized the importance of knowing when to take some profits off the table when things are going your way. According to Cramer, the \u201cmost important lesson\u201d in short-term rallies is that \u201cyou always have to work hard to prepare yourself for the future.\u201d\nCramer said that you should not \u201cgive in\u201d to the market euphoria and hit \u201cbuy, buy, buy\u201d when the market is \u201croaring.\u201d The CNBC host said for many it becomes difficult to sell because they feel they were late to the rally and want to hold on to their best-performing stocks during bull runs. But Cramer questioned this thinking: if your portfolio sees big gains and you let it \u201cride\u201d the rally without selling any stocks and eventually those gains begin to \u201cevaporate,\u201d how is that different from totally missing out on the rally? \u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d Cramer said.\nCramer talked about the post-COVID rally of 2020 and 2021 where the market saw an \u201cunbelievable\u201d bull run, only to pare those gains after the Fed\u2019s pivot and its \u201cwar\u201d on inflation. Jim Cramer advised investors to always remain \u201ctethered\u201d to reality.\n\u201cIf you would have sold stocks gradually on their way up as I told you to do you\u2019d have been in a much better shape as the market spent the next 11 months getting obliterated,\u201d said Cramer.\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired over the past few days and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s bullish on. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\nJim Cramer in a latest program recommended investors not to be \u201ctoo greedy\u201d and refuse to \u201cring the register\u201d on AI stocks such as Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which have had a strong bull run. Cramer, however, reiterated his age-old mantra that he thinks Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0should be owned, but traded. The CNBC host also said he remains a \u201ctrue believer\u201d in Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). But Cramer said he cannot be \u201coblivious\u201d to the \u201cscale\u201d of the massive gains Nvidia stock has seen. He mentioned the latest analysis by stock trader and chartist\u00a0Larry Williams, who is expecting a pullback in Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0shares in the coming weeks.\nCramer also said Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is giving Apple and Microsoft a \u201crun for their money\u201d in terms of market cap. However, he thinks when you have \u201cbig gains\u201d you have to take \u201csomething\u201d off the table.\nNVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest product announcements and its plans revealed at the Computex 2024 show that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts like NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and think its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will start shipping H200 in the second half of this year. At its GTC conference NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed three accelerators \u2013 B200, GB200 and GB200 NVL72. All of these products provide growth catalysts for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares and justify its P/E multiple of 71, given NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth expectation of over 100% this year and 32% next year. Based on 2026 EPS estimate set by Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 35.74, which makes the stock\u2019s valuation attractive given the growth catalysts it has.\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA): NVDA shares were our top contributor in the quarter following blowout 4Q results and 1Q guidance driven by strong data center sales. The company reported quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion, up 265% year-over-year, and EPS in the quarter of $5.16, up 487% year-over-year and 12% ahead of expectations. Revenue guidance for 1Q of $24 billion was 8% above very high expectations. The artificial intelligence arms race kicked-off by ChatGPT and Alphabet\u2019s Bard, among others, has generated tremendous demand for Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphic processors.\nOverall, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio: 10 Best Stocks to Buy. While we acknowledge the potential of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Is Nvidia Stock a Buy After the 10-for-1 Stock Split?",
        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "With shares up by an eyewatering 25,000% over the last 10 years, it's no surprise that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) relies on stock splits to keep its equity price manageable for smaller investors who may not have access to fractional shares. The most recent of these went into effect on June 7 and gave investors 10 shares of Nvidia for each one they previously owned -- bringing its stock price to around $126 at the time of writing.\nThe stock split did nothing to change Nvidia's $3 trillion market cap, which represents the value of all its shares combined. However, some market participants are hopeful that the lower share price could make Nvidia's equity more liquid and help it maintain its explosive bull run. Let's dig deeper to decide if this technology giant is still a buy. \nIf the generative artificial intelligence (AI) industry can be likened to the California gold rush, Nvidia would be selling the picks and shovels every miner needs to dig for gold. The company's industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs) are crucial for running and training complex AI algorithms. And this has led to explosive growth and margins.\nNvidia's first-quarter revenue increased 262% year over year to $26 billion, driven by sales of data center chips, such as the H100. And net income jumped 628% to $14.88 billion.\nConsidering this elevated growth rate, Nvidia's stock is still reasonably valued at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 47. For comparison, rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices has the same forward P/E despite only growing sales by 2% in its first quarter. That said, Nvidia's stock might not be as cheap as it looks on the surface. \nOver the next few years, Nvidia will face incredibly challenging comps. After enjoying booming sales over the previous 12 months, it will be difficult for the company to continue growing its revenue relative to extremely high prior-year numbers. And this might be a big reason why the stock's forward valuation is so low relative to growth. \nDemand could become another problem. While Nvidia's picks-and-shovels take on the AI industry protects it from competition on the consumer side of the industry, it wouldn't be shielded from an industrywide slowdown, which could occur if its clients aren't able to generate enough cash flow to justify their spending on Nvidia chips.\nThe long-term prospects of AI look undeniably bright. But there could be many ups and downs before it reaches its full potential -- just like other major technologies like the internet, electric vehicles, or even blockchain. \nFor many retail investors, Nvidia's stock split will be a powerful psychological encouragement to buy the stock. At just $120 per share, the mammoth company now looks relatively small. And those who were previously intimidated by its four-digit stock price may now be encouraged to finally pull the trigger and hit the buy button. \nBut while Nvidia certainly has a bright future as the AI industry develops, investors who buy the stock now are late to the party. And this brings the risk of being left holding the bag if things go wrong. \nOver the next few years, Nvidia will face more difficult comps, which could cause top- and bottom-line growth to slow down, even if the AI industry remains strong. While shares still look capable of outperforming over the long term, investors should remain aware of the significant risks they are taking by buying a company that has already risen so far so fast.\nHistorically, no stock has grown exponentially forever. And Nvidia will likely face a correction at some point. Be careful out there.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Soared Almost 30% Ahead of Its Stock Split. Can Broadcom Do the Same?",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Investors cheered when Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced a 10-for-1 stock split during its earnings report in late May. And in the two weeks that followed -- the time leading up to the operation -- the shares climbed nearly 30%. Investors like stock splits because they bring the prices of high-flying stocks down, opening them up to a broader range of buyers, and they show the particular company is confident about its future -- the idea is the company believes its stock has what it takes to climb once again.\nThis past week, on the tails of Nvidia's stock split, fellow artificial intelligence (AI) giant Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) said that it, too, would launch a 10-for-1 split. Like Nvidia, Broadcom's shares have posted triple-digit gains over the past few years and soared past $1,000 in recent times. Broadcom is planning its operation for July 12. Now the question is whether the stock could follow in the footsteps of Nvidia and climb in the double digits ahead of the split. Let's find out.\nFirst, a few words about stock splits in general and the upcoming Broadcom operation. In a stock split, a company issues more shares to current shareholders. Doing so brings down the price of each individual share without changing the overall value of the company or the value of each investor's holding. The idea is to make it easier for a wider range of investors, for example those with smaller budgets, to get in on a particular player.\nAs for Broadcom, if you own one share as of July 11, you'll receive nine additional ones after the close of markets on July 12. And on July 15, the shares start trading at the split-adjusted price, which, considering today's Broadcom price, should be around $173.\nBroadcom shares, following the announcement, advanced 12% in one trading session as investors welcomed the news, and the shares climbed more than 3% the following day. So Broadcom is off to a good start when it comes to pre-stock-split performance.\nIt's possible that, like Nvidia, the stock will continue to advance ahead of the operation, as investors have been particularly interested in companies launching such operations. But it's important to remember that, whether Broadcom rises or not in this one-month period before the split, this is just a short-term movement. That means, whether you're already a Broadcom shareholder or buy the stock in the coming days, the performance over the next few weeks is unlikely to change your returns if you hold on for the long term. I'm talking about at least five years.\nThe bigger question is whether Broadcom has the potential to, after its split, keep gaining over time. And here, things are looking bright. Broadcom is a semiconductor and networking giant, selling products that power smartphones, help data centers move and store data, and much more. Its niche has helped the company grow earnings over time, and Broadcom's commitment to research and development (R&D) is a positive sign for the future, with this ongoing innovation potentially translating into growth.\nBroadcom has increased R&D spending at a 27% compounded annual rate since 2009. The company invested more than $5 billion in this area in the most recent fiscal year.\nThis commitment has helped Broadcom address the soaring demand from AI customers for AI networking and custom accelerators. In the most recent quarter, Broadcom said it doubled the number of switches sold compared to the year-earlier period, and demand was particularly strong for Jericho3, a product that scales connectivity to 32,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) in one cluster.\nAlso keep in mind that AI growth is in its early days, as analysts predict the market may reach beyond $1 trillion at the end of the decade. That's up from a little over $200 billion today.\nAll of this means Broadcom's earnings could continue to climb as more and more companies develop AI projects or expand current ones. And that may boost share performance over time. So, yes, if Broadcom shares advance before the stock split, that's good news for shareholders. But if they don't, I wouldn't worry. This networking giant's long-term prospects are solid, and that means whether you buy the stock today or in the coming months you could win big over time.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Rich Duprey ",
        "Text": "Over the past two years, you couldn\u2019t go wrong investing in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The stock that is today synonymous with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution returned nearly 800% for shareholders since OpenAI\u2018s generative AI chatbot ChatGPT was introduced. Just $1,000 invested in the chipmaker at the time would now be worth $7,866.\nBut is Nvidia\u2019s run over? Or more precisely, are there better investment opportunities out there? Some on Wall Street seem to think so. While many hedge fund operators continue to buy the AI chipmaker\u2019s stock, others are cutting their stake. Some even sold off their entire position. The smart money is not holding cash but rather is putting the money to work elsewhere.\nBy following these billionaire stock picks, you might be able to stay ahead of where the smart money thinks the better opportunities lie. Here are three stocks hedge funds bought after selling down their Nvidia stock.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\nThere is a growing list of companies adding advertising platforms to generate additional revenue streams. Many of them are simply \u201cme too\u201d efforts to capture the buzz while others are a more natural integration of the business. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) falls into the latter category.\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the payments leader will be starting an ad network by mining the data collected from its extensive platform. It could be a massive opportunity because it is able to show advertisers exactly what people are buying. Other platforms like Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) are good because they show marketers what consumers are thinking of purchasing. Others, like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), are only able to offer a scattershot approach to reaching potential customers. Few other than PayPal can offer agencies such granular detail on where shoppers are actually spending their money.\nThere are a lot of reasons PayPal stock is a buy at these prices, but the potential ad revenue it can generate seems like a major boost to its top and bottom line.\nA number of hedge fund operators like what they see. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment sold 78% of his Nvidia position and bought 888,000 shares of PayPal at an average buy-in price of $64, for about $57 million. Jim Simon\u2019s Renaissance Technologies sold two-thirds of his stake in the chipmaker and bought over 2.1 million PayPal shares, also around $64. With PayPal stock going for $63 per share at the time of this writing, you can get an even better price than these billionaire investors.\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\nSwitching AI chipmakers is what Steven Cohen did at Point72 Asset Manager. He sold off more than half of his Nvidia holdings in favor of starting a massive stake in mobile chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). He bought over 470,000 shares at an average price of $1,221 per share, meaning he went from having nothing in Broadcom to a position worth over $632 million. The semiconductor stock is now Cohen\u2019s second-largest position.\nAnd why not? Best known for its mobile handset chips, Broadcom recently shifted its focus to data center infrastructure. It began building custom accelerators and found them in high demand among hyper scalers and others.\nEarlier this year the chipmaker said it was \u201cevolving a broad portfolio of technologies to extend its leadership in enabling next-generation AI infrastructure.\u201d In particular, it focused on the lowest power accelerators based on open standards to drive the widest adoption of advanced generative AI clusters.\nAmong the innovations it was bringing to market include Ethernet switches with unprecedented bandwidth density and efficiency, laser technologies for optical interconnect solutions for AI and machine learning, and low-power, high-efficiency retimers that resend a fresh copy of a signal rather than merely boosting an existing one.\nWith Broadcom\u2019s stock up to $1,330, it is more than what Cohen paid but still a bargain for this fast-growing chipmaker.\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\nFamed investment manager Stanley Druckenmiller sold off nearly three-quarters of his Nvidia stake to buy ZoomInfo Technologies (NASDAQ:ZI) instead. His Duquesne Family Office hedge fund bought 5 million shares of the customer acquisition and management software specialist at an average price of $17 a share. He now owns 5.9 million shares worth $94 million.\nHowever, the stock tumbled hard last month after ZoomInfo reported first-quarter results that beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom line. Its guidance, though, wasn\u2019t as strong as the market wanted despite being within Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\nWe\u2019re seeing a lot of that with tech stocks lately. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) had a similar market response after beating analyst estimates because its outlook also wasn\u2019t a blow-the-doors-off number.\nZoomInfo saw net revenue retention (NRR) or the amount of money existing customers spend with the company, fall to 85% in the quarter. That is because in the current high-interest rate environment, many businesses, especially among the small- and medium-sized companies it specializes in, reined in spending. At the mid-market level, though, ZoomInfo was seeing NRR improvement.\nWith the stock now trading at just below $12, the business data specialist offers a 30% discount to Druckenmiller\u2019s buy price. ZoomInfo Technologies says enterprise retention is stabilizing with renewal rates improving year over year for the first time since 2022. It suggests business will resume its upward trajectory shortly.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

U.S. stock markets to close for Juneteenth holiday\nU.S. stock markets are set to remain shuttered for the Juneteenth holiday on Wednesday.\nOn Tuesday, the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both registered fresh record high closes, boosted by a surge in Nvidia shares that pushed the market capitalization of the artificial intelligence chipmaker above software group Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company (more below).\nAlso aiding sentiment was softer-than-anticipated U.S. retail sales data for May, which pointed to a slackening momentum in consumer spending. Traders subsequently bolstered bets that the Federal Reserve will roll out two interest rate cuts this year despite the central bank recently signaling it only expects one.\n2. Nvidia becomes world's most valuable company\nNvidia's stock price rose more than 3% to $135.58 in the prior session, pushing its market cap to $3.34 trillion and above Microsoft's valuation of $3.31 trillion.\nThe California-based company, which designs processors that are seen as critical components of powerful AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, added a little over $110 billion to its market cap -- roughly the equivalent of the entire value of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).\nOnce known as a manufacturer of chips optimized for the gaming community worth around $300 billion, Nvidia has evolved over the last two years into one of the figureheads of soaring enthusiasm around the capabilities of AI. Chief Executive Jensen Huang has said Nvidia is at the heart of a new \"industrial revolution\" that could fundamentally alter the global economy.\nIts massive share increase -- including about a 170% skyrocketing so far this year -- has lifted broader stock markets. A third of the 14% jump in the S&P 500 in 2024 is solely due to Nvidia's rise.\n3. Kugler signals rate cut in 2024\nInflation in the U.S. remains too high, but if economic conditions continue to move in the \"right direction\" it will be appropriate to slash interest rates, according to Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler.\nIn a prepared statement on Wednesday, Kugler said that several recent signs -- including fewer markups, inflation expectations, and anecdotal evidence from businesses -- suggest that price increases are not being as frequently passed on to consumers. These trends, she added, indicate that \"on balance, price-setting behavior is likely to continue to move closer to consistency\" with the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee's stated 2% target.\nBut she noted that she believes interest rates -- currently at a more than two-decade high of 5.25% to 5.50% -- are at a \"sufficiently restrictive\" level to ease economic activity and cool inflation.\nKugler's comments were her first since Fed officials, persuaded by stronger-than-anticipated inflation readings in the opening months of 2024, released updated rate projections last week which showed they do not expect to roll out more than one rate cut this year. In March, they had previously called for as many as three.\nElsewhere on Tuesday, New York Fed President John Williams predicted rates will come down gradually, while Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said he wanted to see further evidence of abating inflation before backing a rate cut.\n4. Golden Goose postpones IPO\nItalian high-end sportswear brand Golden Goose has postponed its planned initial public offering in Milan, citing a \"significant deterioration\" in market conditions following European elections earlier this month and an upcoming snap election in France.\nThe group, which is owned by British private equity firm Permira, added that these trends had impacted the luxury sector in particular.\nGolden Goose, known for its sneakers worn by celebrities like Taylor Swift, was due to price its IPO this week. It is aiming to raise about 600 million euros at a 1.86 million euro valuation. The company noted that it would look into reviving the IPO \"in due course.\"5. Crude prices inch down\nCrude prices edged lower Wednesday, as an unexpected build in U.S. crude inventories raised concerns over demand.\nBy 03:44 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.2% lower at $80.52 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.2% to $85.13 a barrel.\nU.S. crude stocks rose by 2.26 million barrels in the week ended June 14, according data from the American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday. Analysts had expected a 2.2 million barrel draw in crude stocks.\nOfficial U.S. inventories from the Energy Information Administration are due on Thursday, a day later than usual due to the U.S. holiday.\nRelated Articles\nU.S. stock markets close, Nvidia reaches No.1 market cap - what's moving markets\nChinese automakers seek retaliatory tariffs on EU cars, state media reports\nEurope needs greater political stability, EY says\n"

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "What does the hottest stock in the S&P 500 do after skyrocketing more than any other large-cap stock on the market? Announcing a major stock split could be a good follow-up.\nThat's exactly what Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is doing. Shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker have nearly tripled over the last 12 months. Nvidia will conduct a 10-for-1 stock split after the market closes today. The stock will begin trading at a much lower share price on Monday, June 10.\nBut will Nvidia stock soar after its stock split? Here's what history shows.\nStock splits change absolutely nothing about a company's business or its growth prospects. All they're guaranteed to do is increase the number of outstanding shares and lower the share price.\nHowever, one reason why companies conduct stock splits is that the move can provide a nice catalyst. The idea is that some investors sit on the sidelines with a given stock when it's too expensive for them to buy. But when the share price is lower, they're more willing to purchase shares. This could especially apply to a highly followed stock such as Nvidia.\nIs this what history shows? Yes, according to Bank of America's Research Investment Committee. It found that stocks have achieved total returns of 25% in the 12 months after announcing a stock split. By comparison, the S&P 500 rose around 12%, on average, during the same period.\nBut the story isn't quite as good in recent years. Since 2010, stocks with splits have delivered a total return of around 18% during the 12 months following the announcement of a stock split, versus 13% for the S&P 500, according to a report by Statista based on data from Bank of America, Bloomberg, and Global Financial Data.\nHas Nvidia delivered outstanding gains after its previous stock splits? The company has split its stock five times in the past. Let's look at what happened before and afterward in each case.\nOn June 27, 2000, Nvidia conducted a 2-for-1 stock split. In the weeks leading up to the split, the stock steadily vaulted higher.\nHowever, Nvidia's shares fell immediately after the stock split and were down significantly by year-end. One year after the split, the stock was up quite a bit. There's no way to know for sure if this gain was directly attributable to the stock split, though.\nNvidia conducted another 2-for-1 stock split on Sept. 12, 2001. This time, the company's shares fell both ahead of and immediately after the split. The stock rebounded during the rest of the year. However, it then began a steep decline (as did the broader market).\nSeveral years passed before Nvidia's next 2-for-1 stock split on April 7, 2006. In this case, the stock rose before the split and then fell shortly afterward. Following a sharp sell-off, Nvidia's shares bounced back. Still, a year later, it was up barely over 1%, while the S&P 500 was up more than 13%.\nThe next year, Nvidia conducted its first 3-for-2 stock split. The stock again climbed ahead of the stock split. The good times didn't last for long, though. Nvidia soon plunged with a much worse decline than the S&P 500.\nNvidia conducted a 4-for-1 stock split on July 20, 2021. This was another good news/bad news scenario.\nThe chipmaker's shares jumped both before and immediately after the stock split. A year later, though, Nvidia's share price was lower than when the split occurred. However, Nvidia still managed to outperform the S&P 500 during this period.\nCan we draw any solid conclusions from Nvidia's stock-split history? Unfortunately, no.\nI wouldn't put too much faith in the Bank of America findings about the long-term outperformance of stocks after announcing splits, either. It's possible that the individual stocks that beat the S&P 500 after announcing stock splits would have done so, even without splitting their shares.\nThere's a much better reason to buy Nvidia stock than its stock split, anyway. The demand for high-powered chips to train and run artificial intelligence (AI) models continues to soar. Nvidia is the undisputed leader in the AI chip market, and its rapid speed of innovation seems likely to keep the company at the top for the next few years.\nThis should translate to strong earnings growth. When earnings grow, share prices typically follow -- stock split or no stock split.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Will Alphabet Be Worth More Than Nvidia by 2025?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock has rallied by more than 40% over the past 12 months and is currently hovering near its all-time high. The tech giant impressed investors with the accelerating growth of its advertising and cloud businesses, a new $70 billion share buyback plan, and the approval of its first-ever dividend.\nThose positive developments somewhat allayed investors concerns about Alphabet's slower progress in the artificial intelligence (AI) market relative to its peers, but it is still overshadowed by Nvidia, which rallied by more than 210% over the past 12 months as the market's demand for its AI accelerator chips outstripped its ability to supply them.\nNvidia also surpassed Alphabet's market cap for the first time this year. As of this writing, Nvidia is worth $3.3 trillion while Alphabet is worth $2.2 trillion. But could Alphabet accelerate and overtake Nvidia again by the end of 2025?\nAlphabet generates most of its revenue from Google's advertising business, which includes its search and display ads, network ads, and YouTube. The rest of its revenue mainly comes from Google Cloud, the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure platform, as well as Google's subscription, platforms, and devices division.\nAlphabet's revenue only rose 10% in 2022 as concerns about the macroeconomic outlook led many companies to rein in their marketing and cloud spending. The company also faced stiff competition from Meta Platforms\u00a0and ByteDance in the advertising market, and it seemed to struggle against Amazon\u00a0and Microsoft\u00a0in the cloud market. But over the past year, all three of Alphabet's core businesses warmed up again.\nMetric\nQ1 2023\nQ2 2023\nQ3 2023\nQ4 2023\nQ1 2024\nGoogle advertising revenue growth (YOY)\n0%\n3%\n9%\n11%\n13%\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenue growth (YOY)\n9%\n24%\n21%\n23%\n18%\nGoogle cloud revenue growth (YOY)\n28%\n28%\n22%\n26%\n28%\nTotal revenue growth (YOY)\n3%\n7%\n11%\n13%\n15%\nData source: Alphabet. YOY = Year-over-year.\nGoogle's advertising business recovered as rising sales for YouTube and search-based ads offset declining ad network revenues. Its cloud growth accelerated as it rolled out over a thousand new products and features, and it continued to expand its Gemini generative AI platform.\nGoogle's subscriptions, platforms, and devices segment also locked in more subscribers. As of the end of the first quarter of 2024, YouTube Premium and Music had reached 100 million global subscribers, YouTube TV hit 8 million subscribers, and Google One surpassed 100 million subscribers. Those expansions should widen the company's moat and reduce its dependence on ads.\nAlphabet could benefit from several tailwinds over the next three years. The macroeconomic environment could improve as the Fed cuts interest rates, which would likely lead to companies spending more money on its ads and cloud services again. The ban of TikTok in the U.S., which will take effect next January unless ByteDance sells its U.S. subsidiary, could drive more users to YouTube.\nBut it also faces tough challenges. It's struggling to make headway in the generative AI space, where its offerings aren't as impressive as those of Microsoft and OpenAI. The upcoming launch of Apple's \u00a0generative AI ecosystem could reduce the amount of revenue Google earns from ads displayed to users of Apple devices -- even though Google pays Apple billions of dollars each year to remain its default search engine. Also, Alphabet still faces ongoing antitrust and privacy probes in the U.S., Europe, and other regions.\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Alphabet's revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 11% as its EPS increases at a compound annual rate of 20%. Based on those estimates, which seem realistic relative to its past growth rates, its stock looks reasonably valued at 23 times forward earnings.\nIf Alphabet meets those expectations and trades at the same forward earnings multiple at the end of 2025, its stock price would have risen 30% to about $228, boosting its market cap to $2.9 trillion -- but that would still be below where Nvidia sits today. Nvidia will also likely keep growing as the AI chip market expands.\nAlphabet and Nvidia are both \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, but they operate in different industries and have different business models. Alphabet is a top play on the digital advertising and cloud markets, while Nvidia is the leader in AI and gaming GPUs. So instead of wondering if Alphabet will become more valuable than Nvidia again, investors should focus on its macro, competitive, and regulatory challenges. If it resolves those issues, it should remain a solid long-term investment.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Here's How Much Nvidia Stock You Own in Your S&P 500 Index Fund. Do You Want More, or Less?",
        "Author": "  Matt Frankel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "How much of the S&P 500 does Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) make up and how exposed are you through your S&P 500 index fund? Theoretically, all S&P 500 index funds should have the same proportions of assets invested in each stock, so let's take a look at the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).\nI won't keep you in suspense. According to Vanguard's website, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has 6.1% of its assets invested in Nvidia stock.\nOne caveat is that this data is as of May 31 and the price of Nvidia is up by about 15% since that time, through June 21. Since the S&P 500 is a weighted index, this implies that the concentration of Nvidia in S&P 500 index funds could be significantly higher than the latest portfolio data indicates by the time the end-of-June updates are revealed. Based on a 15% gain in the stock, this means the likely allocation is about 7%.\nIf you believe in Nvidia as an excellent long-term investment and want more exposure, the obvious way to get it is to buy the stock directly. However, owning individual stocks isn't right for everyone, so let's look at a couple of ways you can accomplish this in the ETF world.\nAs one option, you can choose a more tech-focused index fund. The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) is one example. The ETF tracks the Nasdaq 100 index, and as of June 18 had a significantly higher 8.69% Nvidia allocation.\nAnother option is the Roundhill Investments Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS), which has exposure to Nvidia as well the other six mega-cap tech stocks. This fund offers equal-weight exposure to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and of course, Nvidia. This implies that about 14.3% of the fund will be allocated to Nvidia at any given time, although it can fluctuate a bit in the short term.\nOn the other hand, let's say that having 7% of your money invested in Nvidia is a little too much for your comfort zone. Here are three ETF alternatives that can help you reduce your exposure.\nIf you still want S&P 500 exposure but without the mega-cap concentration, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEMKT: EWI) could be a great fit. It divides investors' money evenly among the 500 companies in the index, so its allocation to any stock, even Nvidia, is always set at just 0.2%.\nIf you don't want to reduce it that much, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEMKT: VTI) could be worth a look. Instead of investing in just the S&P 500, the fund has over 3,700 stocks, including mid- and small caps. It's still a weighted index, but the added holdings bring the Nvidia exposure down to 5.1%.\nFinally, another way to go would be to add some index funds without any Nvidia exposure at all. The dividend-focused Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT: VYM) and the Vanguard Value Index Fund ETF (NYSEMKT: VTV) are two good examples.\nOne of the biggest issues with index fund investing, especially when it comes to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, is the weighted nature of these benchmarks. Many investors believe the S&P 500 is a diversified investment vehicle, while the mega-cap tech stocks make up a disproportional amount of the fund's assets. If you're a big believer in Nvidia and its big-tech counterparts, this can be a good thing. But if you read this article and are surprised at how much exposure you have, taking steps to diversify could be a smart idea.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Howard Smith, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the big debates among Wall Street followers lately has been just how far Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock can run. A new report from one analyst leads the charge on how high shares will go.\nSusquehanna senior semiconductor analyst Chris Rolland just raised his firm's price target from $145 to $160 per share. That would represent a gain of more than 20% from recent levels to a market cap of $3.94 trillion. The question for investors is how bold an outlook seems reasonable for Nvidia.\nNvidia shares have soared by nearly 600% since January 2023, thanks to insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). Customers can't get enough of those industry-leading processors, which they require to meet the massive computing power needs of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Nvidia already has its next-generation chips in production, and henceforth plans to introduce new versions every year.\nNvidia also plans to integrate software to give customers more end-to-end solutions for data center servers. Rolland thinks that software will be a key factor that drives Nvidia's share price to his Street-high estimate.\nNvidia's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) toolkit allows users to develop, enhance, and deploy applications on multiple types of GPU-accelerated embedded systems. Rolland said that CUDA is \"the operating system for large language model processing and/or training as of right now.\"\nIt makes sense to focus on software and other products beyond GPUs as potential drivers of Nvidia's future gains. After all, while demand outpaces supply for chips, production capacity remains a limitation on how much revenue Nvidia can generate from its hardware. Competition is also likely to chip away at market share.\nBut Rolland's valuation still appears a bit aggressive. He based that target on the stock being valued at a ratio of 51.5 times his 2025 forecast for adjusted earnings per share. I don't doubt Nvidia will keep growing its top and bottom lines. However, while it's a stock worth owning for the long term, it might not get that valuation as soon as next year.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Jamie McGeever\n(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\nThe wave of profit-taking in U.S. Big Tech and AI stocks appears to be gathering momentum, which could depress investor sentiment and risk appetite in Asia on Tuesday even if it is offset by a rotation into cheaper, beaten down sectors.\nThe Dow's rise to a one-month high on Monday as the Nasdaq declined for a third day will be well-received, of course. But ahead of U.S. inflation figures on Friday, which is also the last trading day of the quarter, caution may prevail.\nOtherwise, the macroeconomic backdrop to the start of the week seems fairly supportive for Asian and emerging markets - Treasury yields edged lower on Monday and the dollar had its biggest fall in nearly two weeks.\nTuesday's regional economic calendar is light, with the highlights being consumer price inflation from Malaysia, service sector producer prices from Japan, the latest measures of consumer confidence in South Korea and Australia, and trade figures from Hong Kong.\nThe market tone across Asia on Tuesday could be set by the tempest brewing in tech. Nvidia shares slumped 6.7% on Monday, bringing their decline in the last three days to 16%, and weighing heavily on semiconductor and tech shares more broadly.\nTaiwan's benchmark index lost nearly 2% on Monday, its biggest fall in two months, and blue chip issue Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co lost more than 3%. And that was before Nvidia's slump on Tuesday.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Tech index scraped a two-month low on Monday before recovering most of these losses to end down only 0.6%. Again, the weakness in U.S. tech and semiconductor stocks on Monday - especially the accelerated selloff at the close - doesn't bode well for the sector in Asia on Tuesday.\nBack in the macro world, minutes of the Bank of Japan's last meeting on Monday showed that Japanese policymakers discussed a near-term interest rate hike, with one calling for an increase \"without too much delay\" to help get inflation back down.\nCurrency traders, however, seem unimpressed. The yen appreciated a bit on Monday but only marginally, and it remains within touching distance of the 160 per dollar level that recently pushed Japanese authorities to spend billions of dollars in yen-buying intervention.\nThe next big inflation number from Japan will be Tokyo consumer price inflation on Friday. This is usually seen as a good barometer of nationwide price pressures, and with the yen so weak and oil prices up 12% in the last three weeks, officials may be getting twitchy.\nAnnual inflation in Malaysia, meanwhile, is expected to have accelerated slightly to 1.9% in May from 1.8% in April, according to a Reuters poll of economists.\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Tuesday:\n- Japan services PPI (May)\n- Malaysia CPI (May)\n- Australia consumer sentiment (June)\n(Reporting by Jamie McGeever; Editing by Josie Kao)\n"

        "Text": "Nvidia stock soared to record highs following its 10-for-1 split. Following that increase, it became the stock with the world's largest market cap. Another chip giant, Broadcom, is far from such an achievement but has shot higher since announcing its own split.\nGiven those reactions, such a move could be next for other AI stocks that announce stock splits. The question for investors is which stocks will make such a move. While the answer to that question remains to be seen, a similar increase could happen for the following stocks:\nPerhaps it's no surprise that Nvidia partner Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) should emerge as a stock-split candidate. Despite a worldwide reach and a stock that has traded since 2007, it was a server manufacturer largely unknown outside its industry.\nThat changed when it and Nvidia announced a partnership. Consequently, Supermicro stock has outperformed Nvidia's over the last year.\nThe increase briefly took its share price above $1,000 in March, and despite the surge, it could be undervalued.\nThanks to revenue growth estimated to reach 110% this year, analysts forecast nearly $24 per share in net income. That is quite a feat, considering that its share price was $24 as recently as four years ago.\nDespite that increase, Supermicro's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 52, which is a low valuation given the growth rate. That growth and the possible catalyst of a lower nominal share price after a split could be what Supermicro needs to keep moving higher.\nASML (NASDAQ: ASML) remains a relatively unknown semiconductor stock. Nonetheless, it is one of the most crucial chip companies because it builds the most advanced extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines.\nHence, manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung need its machines to make their cutting-edge chips.\nMoreover, countries want to move more manufacturing away from Taiwan, the island that produces about two-thirds of the world's chips. That fear has led to tens of billions in subsidies going into ASML's industry.\nThe AI-driven demand for chips has become a boon to ASML as chip fabricators scramble to increase capacity. Investors looking to capitalize on the AI boom have bid its stock price higher, and it is up more than 430% over the last five years, taking its stock price to around $1,050 as of this writing.\nThe run-up has taken the P/E to a lofty 54. Nonetheless, the demand for EUV machines likely means its long-term growth continues, and a split in the near future improves the chances of ASML moving higher in the short term as well.\nAs one of the largest cloud providers, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) plays a key role in running AI applications. It was one of the companies that built an alliance with OpenAI, whose ChatGPT platform makes it a more crucial AI company.\nThat led investors to bid the stock price higher by more than 30% over the last year, giving Microsoft the world's largest market cap for most of the year.\nAmid its rising value, the company still trades at around $450 per share, which might not inspire most companies to split shares in today's market.\nHowever, investors often forget that it is one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Since that is a price-weighted index, a higher nominal price gives Microsoft a disproportionate influence over the Dow. Thus, the index tends to pressure its members to split their stocks when the price becomes high.\nGiven the bump that benefited Nvidia and Broadcom, such pressure could be a blessing in disguise. A stock split could give Microsoft investors a reason to bid its stock higher despite its 39 P/E ratio, possibly meaning a split will happen sooner rather than later.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "3 ETFs to Buy for Nvidia Stock Dominance",
        "Author": "  Joey Frenette ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has grown to become quite a dominant holding in a number of tech-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) amid its glorious ascent. Though NVDA stock is no longer the world\u2019s largest company after its latest correction, bringing the market cap to $3 trillion flat, I still think it\u2019s a bad idea to think the firm can\u2019t continue its growth just because of its behemoth size.\nIndeed, a firm\u2019s sheer size alone doesn\u2019t seem to act as a limitation on growth, especially for firms, like Nvidia, which seems to have pulled so far ahead of the pack on AI. Further, in the artificial intelligence (AI) age, where data is a precious commodity, perhaps the size of a firm is fuel for further growth. The S&P 500 is already top-heavy. But it could become a lot top-heavier as the AI boom continues.\nNVDA stock is expected to keep experiencing intense volatility. For those who want to dampen the choppiness, perhaps an Nvidia-exposed ETF is worth consideration. Let\u2019s examine three that are heavy on NVDA shares.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nSource: shutterstock.com/bangoland\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK) is perhaps the most interesting tech ETF to watch following the big rebalancing of its top holdings.\nIndeed, ETF rebalancing acts tend to be less of a big deal. However, the XLK is even top-heavier than the Nasdaq 100. And it\u2019s extremely concentrated in its top two holdings, with other individual holdings (including the third largest) typically contributing 5% or less.\nToday, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia each contribute over 20% of the XLK ETF\u2019s holdings. Indeed, having more than 40% in just two stocks takes portfolio concentration to another level.\nThough cranking up the Nvidia exposure at the expense of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2014which now has a 4.5% weighting in the XLK, down from over 20%\u2014may prove ill-timed. If NVDA stock\u2019s correction continues while AAPL stock gains on Apple Intelligence, I do think XLK is giving investors what they want. The crowds want more Nvidia, and they\u2019re getting to go with a huge serving of Microsoft shares with the XLK.\nSource: shutterstock.com/sdecoret\nThe VanEck Robotics ETF (NASDAQ:IBOT) is another Nvidia-heavy ETF. Further, NVDA stock boasts a sizable but not colossal weight, typically lying in the single-digit percentages. Indeed, if you like Nvidia but don\u2019t want it to be too much of a needle mover on an ETF, IBOT may be more your thing.\nAdditionally, investors gain exposure to interesting semiconductor equipment makers that could greatly benefit from automation robotics in manufacturing. More intriguingly, many of the names are lesser-known international firms striving to unlock the benefits of AI and automation in the physical world.\nAll considered, the IBOT ETF looks like a diversified way to play robotics companies that extend well beyond Nvidia. The greater diversification relative to the XLK is a major plus for new investors who want to steer away from overconcentration risk rather than towards it for a shot at bigger gains.\nSource: Shutterstock\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) is a popular ETF to get a quick gauge of the health of the broader semiconductor market. As you\u2019d expect, SMH shares have been smoking hot of late, up more than 53% year-to-date (YTD).\nLike NVDA stock, the SMH has been a bit wobbly this month, pulling back around 6.5% from all-time highs. The dip is likely nothing to worry about given the hot semi plays probably still have years of growth ahead of them.\nDespite broad exposure to 26 holdings, the SMH, like the XLK, is heavy on Nvidia, with the stock comprising more than 20% of the ETF. However, unlike the XLK, Nvidia is the only firm to boast a weight of more than 20%. In the second spot, it\u2019s Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), with a 12.9% weight.\nIndeed, SMH and XLK both look incredibly enticing if you want a passive way to play Nvidia and its peers. Depending on which angle you want to play tech, both ETFs stand out as intriguing.\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple and Microsoft.

        "Text": "\"The very best way to make money is in a small growth company that has been profitable for a couple of years and simply goes on growing.\"\n-- Peter Lynch\u00a0\nEveryone is eager to find the next Nvidia. And why wouldn't they be? Its stock is up a staggering 934% since October 2022.\nSo, where does one go when looking for the next Nvidia? One answer is provided by Peter Lynch, who is one of the greatest investors of all time. As the quote above says, it's best to look for young growth companies that could potentially offer high returns. \nOne such company is The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD). Here's why it's a stock worth considering now.\nLet's cut right to the chase. The Trade Desk isn't a company most people know. That's because the company operates in a little-known but widely used space: the programmatic advertising market.\nIn short, The Trade Desk acts as an advertising middleman -- connecting advertisers with content publishers who sell ad space. For example, many streamers, like Netflix, Walt Disney, and Paramount, have launched ad-supported subscription tiers. They have ad space to sell and want to collect the most ad revenue possible. \nSimilarly, marketing agencies want to generate the best return on investment for their clients' ad campaigns. That means targeting ads to the most receptive audience possible.\nThe Trade Desk helps both sides achieve their aims through its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platform that enables real-time bidding and optimization, ensuring the best ad placements for advertisers and maximum revenue for publishers.\nIt's a lucrative business, and one that has helped The Trade Desk grow by leaps and bounds.\nAs of its most recent quarter (ended on March 31), The Trade Desk reported quarterly revenue of $491 million, up 29% from a year ago. Over the last five years, trailing-12-month revenue has grown from $560 million to $2.1 billion -- or roughly a fourfold increase.\nAnalysts expect the company to grow sales 24% this year and a further 20% in 2025. In addition, the overall digital ad market -- already estimated at nearly $750 billion -- is expected to continue growing well past $1 trillion in the coming years.\nClearly, The Trade Desk is a hot stock in a growing sector. However, there are some concerns. For one thing, the stock is pricey. With a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 24, The Trade Desk is far more expensive than most stocks. Even within the tech sector, the company's P/S ratio is about twice the average.\nThat said, the company has now been profitable for several years, and it has a rock-solid balance sheet with $1.4 billion in cash on hand and only $0.2 billion in debt. So, growth-oriented investors may be willing to pay up for a stock that is poised to cash in on the growth of the digital advertising market. \nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and The Trade Desk wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Prarthana Prakash ",
        "Text": "It\u2019s not every day that a startup rallies to stratospheric heights to become the world\u2019s most valuable company and a leading player in the competitive AI chips industry. That\u2019s Nvidia for you.\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there\u2014the tale of Nvidia\u2019s success is still developing, as it single-handedly eclipses all of Europe\u2019s stock markets in market capitalization.\nAs of earlier this week, Nvidia became the world\u2019s most valuable company, thanks to an aggressive rally in its stock that has swayed all of Wall Street.\nWith a $3.2 trillion market cap now, Deutsche Bank in a note on Thursday found that Nvidia is now bigger than the value of all the listed stocks in Europe\u2019s major business hubs\u2014Germany, France and the U.K. At the time the note was published, Nvidia\u2019s market cap was $3.35 trillion.\nIt didn\u2019t always look like this. A decade ago, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) had a significant lead, with its listed stocks collectively worth 400 times Nvidia\u2019s value. But in the last week, Nvidia left LSE in the dust.\nAt its sky-high valuation, the only markets whose listed shares are collectively larger than Nvidia are the U.S., India, China and Japan, Deutsche Bank said.\nThe California-based company\u2019s growth has been ramping up for a while now. It\u2019s also rare for companies to see such rapid growth, even in the tech universe. Apple was the first trillion-dollar company back in 2018, eventually hitting the $3 trillion mark last year. The AI frenzy helped Microsoft beat Apple to become the most valuable company in January before Nvidia grabbed the crown from the Redmond, Wash.-based company.\nNvidia\u2019s GPUs, or graphic processing units, have waltzed with the recent surge in AI demand. Meanwhile, the speed and performance of its chips and the suite of tech solutions Nvidia offers have progressed, too. Investors have paid attention to the company\u2019s strengths, doubling the stock\u2019s value since January that resulted in a 10-for-1 stock split earlier in June.\nIt\u2019s hard to compare a company with such supersized growth to just about anything else in the world\u2014let alone the LSE. Nvidia\u2019s growth trajectory, which is still accelerating, has been startling given the U.S. is still navigating relatively high interest rates.\nStill, LSE has recently had big wins. It just beat Paris to become Europe\u2019s largest stock exchange amid political turmoil in France while also welcoming the strong IPO of computer maker Raspberry Pi.\nThose achievements have paled in comparison to London's relative weakness in attracting top company listings and growing its value. Even today, the dominant players in its stock market belong to traditional industries such as energy, mining, and financials, with only a handful of tech players.\nWhat LSE is seeing now isn\u2019t a product of its lack of ambition, the exchange\u2019s chief Julia Hoggett argued. It\u2019s still undoubtedly a critical financial hub\u2014just in need of revamping.\n\u201cThe U.K. does not invest in itself as much as it could, or should,\u201d Hoggett said in an op-ed for The Times of London on Thursday, adding that the markets were undergoing \u201cthe largest reform in decades.\u201d\nThe overhaul, which could kick in as early as this year, include changes to the listing rules and more participation of the Brits in stock market investments through their pension schemes.\nThe LSE chief previously commented on the U.K.\u2019s stock market as \u201cpunching above its weight.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you strip them out and look at the actual companies of similar sizes in the U.S. to the sort of company size that we have in the U.K. They haven\u2019t really been out-performing,\u201d she told the BBC last month.\nThe example of Nvidia highlights how a big growth story in the U.S. can still give London a run for its money. What London\u2014and other European financial hubs\u2014do to stay in the game remains a question. \nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

While the Blackwell chip just went into production, the company is already highlighting what's coming after that.\nAt a Taiwan trade show over the weekend, CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the next-generation AI chip due in 2026. The Rubin chip platform will include new graphics processing units (GPUs) as well as a new central processing unit (CPU).\nThe company is expanding its range of AI products, and that has one Wall Street analyst boosting his firm's target price for Nvidia stock even higher. Mizuho's Vijay Rakesh now thinks the stock is worth $1,275 per share, a boost from his prior $1,180 estimate. And it comes after Nvidia shares pushed 31% higher over just the last month, reaching about $1,164. Rakesh's estimate implies a 9.5% increase over the next 12 months from the current price.\nHuang told trade show attendees, \"Our basic philosophy is very simple: Build the entire data center scale, disaggregate and sell to you parts on a one-year rhythm, and push everything to technology limits.\" Rakesh sees that domination in AI hardware as a key reason the stock will continue to rise.\nEarnings could continue to ramp up this year and beyond as demand for its newer data-center rack solutions continues to outpace supply -- and the stock price will likely follow earnings higher. The company will also complete its planned 10-for-1 stock split on Friday, June 7, and the analyst says that could attract more interest from retail investors.\nBut the success of Nvidia's business itself is reason enough to believe that the stock can hit Mizuho's new, higher price target.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s latest announcements at Computex in Taiwan have further proved that the chipmaker is \u201cso much more than GPUs,\u201d Wells Fargo analysts highlighted in a Sunday note.\nDuring his keynote address at National Taiwan University, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled a new Blackwell Ultra chip for 2025 and a next-generation platform in development called Rubin for 2026. The company also announced the widespread adoption of its Spectrum-X Ethernet AI-optimized networking platform.\nWells Fargo analysts believe the Spectrum-X Ethernet platform is particularly noteworthy for its ability to support 512 radix scaling by 2025 with the Spectrum-X800 Ultra and 102.4T silicon, which will scale up to millions of GPUs by 2026 with the Spectrum-X1600.\n\u201cNvidia emphasized that Spectrum-X will move to an annual cadence,\u201d the note added.\nMeanwhile, the newly-revealed Rubin platform, expected in 2026, will include cutting-edge components such as the NVLink v6 switch, Vera CPUs, and the CX9 SuperNIC. The Rubin GPU will feature 8 HBM4, while the \u201cRubin Ultra\u201d will come with 12 HBM4 chips. .Furthermore, the technology behemoth also announced it will launch its DRIVE platform with Mercedes in 2025 and Jaguar-Land Rover in 2026. Wells Fargo analysts noted the importance of these partnerships, saying they are viewed as \u201cinflection points for Nvidia\u2019s Auto segment.\u201d\nThe investment bank pointed out several more takeaways from the event, including Nvidia\u2019s emphasis on NVDA Inference Microservices (NIMs), which leverage an installed base of hundreds of millions of CUDA GPUs.\n\u201cCUDA has now reached a virtuous cycle; underpinned by a +5 million developer ecosystem spanning across almost every industry,\u201d analysts added.\nIn addition, Wells Fargo mentioned that Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell GPUs are already in production, with sample shipments expected in the second fiscal quarter of 2025 and revenue ramping in the second half of 2025. These GPUs have significantly improved energy efficiency, reducing energy per token created by more than 300 times over the past eight years.\nRelated Articles\nWells Fargo says Nvidia 'so much more than GPUs' after next-gen chip announcement\nNvidia's latest AI chips likely to \"leverage\" TSMC technology - Goldman Sachs\nGoldman Sachs added these 2 stocks to its conviction list in June\n"

        "Title": "With 67% ownership, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) boasts of strong institutional backing",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Institutions' substantial holdings in NVIDIA implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 45% ownership\n Recent sales by insiders \nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 67% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about NVIDIA.\n View our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nNVIDIA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. NVIDIA is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.4% and 4.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Additionally, the company's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang directly holds 3.5% of the total shares outstanding.\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\nWe can report that insiders do own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$119b. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. \nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 29% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NVIDIA better, we need to consider many other factors.

        "Title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Buying Up This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market since 2023. However, after the stellar run it has been on, some lofty expectations are built in. While Nvidia will likely hit these goals, investors may be better off looking at companies that don't have as high of expectations.\nThat's exactly what many billionaires have been doing in their hedge funds. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) was a popular purchase among some top hedge funds (and the billionaires that run them). In the first quarter, some that increased their Alphabet positions were Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management, and George Soros' Soros Fund Management.\nAlthough Nvidia is a strong artificial intelligence (AI) pick, Alphabet is also a fantastic investment.\nAlphabet has multiple ways to benefit from the rise of AI, but the avenue that will have the largest result is advertising. In Q1, more than three-quarters of Alphabet's revenue came from advertising. AI has already been used for some time in advertising, as it's used to pinpoint what type of ads will drive the highest return for Alphabet's customers.\nAlthough it's becoming more mainstream, AI has been around for a while. However, the latest iteration of the technology, generative AI, has some useful features that allow people to use the technology without needing a programming background. One way Alphabet deployed generative AI into its platform is by integrating it into its compliance software, Performance Max (PMax). This is essentially a checklist for advertisers to ensure their ads have the best possible chance of succeeding. In the past, it used to take multiple iterations to construct an ad meeting all criteria. Now, Gemini (Alphabet's generative AI product) automatically writes ads that meet the criteria.\nAlphabet's in-house generative AI platform, Gemini, has had its fair share of problems, but those are starting to get ironed out. Now that it is more accurate, customers can build their models on the Gemini platform. Alphabet will charge a fee to companies that do this, giving it another stream of cash.\nAnother avenue is Google Cloud. Running AI models takes serious computing power, and many companies either don't have it or can't justify spending millions of dollars on a system that may not be used enough to justify its cost. Cloud computing is the answer to this problem, allowing anyone to rent computing space from a cloud computing provider like Google Cloud.\nWhether it's data storage or processing power, Google Cloud has clients covered. With access to the latest generation of Nvidia GPUs for training models, Google Cloud is a top competitor in this space.\nAlphabet is set to benefit from the latest wave of AI, making it a must-own stock. It's also priced at a reasonable point.\nBecause many companies are experiencing massive changes and growth due to AI, it's smart to look at a company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Although it uses analyst projections to determine what a company's earnings may be over the next 12 months, which aren't perfect, it's still a good guide for investors.\nCompared to Nvidia's 41 times earnings, Alphabet's stock is much cheaper.\nAt 23 times forward earnings, Alphabet is a reasonably priced stock. Compared to the broader market's forward P/E of 21.5 (measured by the S&P 500), Alphabet doesn't hold much of a premium.\nThis is why Alphabet is such a better pick than Nvidia. It's reasonably priced, so any business gains will go toward increasing its stock price rather than meeting lofty expectations and reducing the premium investors have to pay for a stock.\nThese billionaires think Alphabet is a great buy right now. Long-term investors who want less risky exposure to AI should consider making Alphabet one of their top picks.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Lee Clifford ",
        "Text": "Can anything slow Nvidia's ascent? That's the question on the minds of most investors as the tech darling continues to break records. This week alone the company briefly passed mighty Microsoft to notch the title of the world's most valuable company (though by Friday it had dipped back into 2nd place). According to Fortune's calculations, $1,000 invested in NVDA stock 10 years ago would be worth almost $300,000 today.\nBut the analysts at Bank of America believe there's still plenty of room for NVDA to run. In a recently published note analysts Vivek Arya, Duksang Jang, and Lauren Guy write that while the stock's steep climb make it \"vulnerable\" to profit-taking, any volatility is likely to be short-lived. (They note that Nvidia is already up 50% in Q2 vs. 4% for the S&P 500). They put a price target of $150 on the stock, which as of midday Friday was trading just above $126.\nWhat may drive Nvidia's stock higher? The analysts write that GenAI hardware deployments are still only in the second year of what could be a three- to five-year deployment cycle, representing around $300 billion in long-term opportunity, and a three-times increase on the current year. They also believe NVDA's \"next-gen purpose-built Blackwell AI accelerator systems will start later this year, with solid demand/visibility across cloud customers.\" The analysts write that Dr. Ian Buck, Nvidia's VP of Hyperscale, recently presented at a BofA tech conference and they came away impressed. \"Dr. Buck stressed NVDA's moat in co-optimizing and consistently improving silicon, system and software,\" they wrote.\nAs for valuation? The BofA teams calls it \"compelling\" at \"only\" a P/E of around 30, based on the bull case earnings scenario of $5 per share. They note that quarterly earnings per share have grown six times, well ahead of the the 4.5x stock move since the \"seminal\" Q1 of 2024. Bottom line: \"Unlike the 'dotcom boom' that was funded by risky debt-taking, genAI deployment is a mission-critical race between some of the best-funded (cloud) customers,\" the analysts write.\nBut not everyone is convinced. As Shawn Tully wrote recently for Fortune, there's a case to be made that Nvidia is a fabulous company with a bright future and an AI pioneer\u2014but at these valuations is still destined to be an extremely poor investment. Tully spoke to David Trainer, founder and CEO of research firm New Constructs who told him: \u201cNvidia\u2019s valuation is ridiculous. It\u2019s facing the same curse as\u00a0Tesla. But when Tesla got profitable, loads of competitors entered the EV space, cutting margins and slowing sales. The same will happen with Nvidia.\u201d\nTully added that Trainer believes investors are awarding Nvidia such an inflated valuation \u201cby extrapolating the competitive advantage it has today in perpetuity.\u201d But margins as magical as Nvdia has posted don't go unnoticed, he points out. As he told Tully, \u201cAnytime a competitor sees margins like that, they jump in and make big investments to grab part of your business. For now, Nvidia can do what no one else can do, but the best competitors will find a way. It will become a race to the bottom.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "NVIDIA recently surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world's most valuable company.\nIts market share price hit an all-time high, pushing its market valuation to $3.335 trillion on Tuesday.\nThe change in the chipmaker's market capitalization can be attributed to the increasing demand for AI chips.\nEvery major tech corporation dabbling with AI is seemingly fighting for the world's most valuable company crown. Microsoft and Apple have been contending for the position over the past few months, with the former having the upper hand most times.\nMarket analysts attribute Microsoft's success in the AI landscape to its early multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI and adoption across its products and services. Apple recently surpassed Microsoft and became the world's most valuable company after announcing its AI strategy with Apple Intelligence as its headliner.\nInterestingly, NVIDIA is now the world's most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft and Apple. On Tuesday, the chipmaker's market share price rose to an all-time high, pushing its market valuation to $3.335 trillion.\nNVIDIA's rise to the top doesn't come as a surprise. In early June, the company became the second-most valuable company in the world ahead of Apple, and was just a few hundred million dollars behind Microsoft.\nMore CPUs & GPUs\n- Best NVIDIA GPUs - Best Intel CPUs - Best AMD CPUs - Best AMD GPUs\nMajor companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and even Meta are heavily dependent on NVIDIA for GPUs to foster their AI advances. At some point, the chipmaker was unable to supply the high demand for AI chips.\nRecent developments indicated Microsoft and OpenAI invested over $100 billion in a project dubbed Stargate. If everything goes according to plan, both companies could potentially free themselves from an overreliance on NVIDIA for AI chips.\nNVIDIA is undoubtedly on a wining streak with AI. Last year, NVIDIA was named the most profitable semiconductor chip brand in the world, with Microsoft and Meta as its A-list clients. Its revenue for Q3 2023 stood at $18.12 billion, with $10.42 billion in profits. Figuratively, this translated to a 206% year-over-year increase due to the high demand for AI chips.\n"

        "Title": "Prediction: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia Will Struggle to Retain Its Trillion-Dollar Market Cap by 2026",
        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Since the proliferation of the internet roughly 30 years ago, there hasn't been a next-big-thing technology, innovation, or trend that's come remotely close to rivaling it... until now.\nThe arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) is forecast to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to analysts at PwC. With AI, software and systems are given autonomy over tasks that would normally be overseen or undertaken by humans. The catch is that these systems have the ability to learn and evolve over time without human intervention. The capacity to become more proficient over time gives AI utility in pretty much every sector and industry.\nAlthough most AI stocks have been unstoppable over the last 18 months, it's Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) that unquestionably sits on a pedestal above all others.\nSince 2023 began, shares of Nvidia have gained 828%, as of June 19, 2024, with the company adding nearly $3 trillion in market value and undergoing a recent 10-for-1 stock split. In fact, Nvidia unseated Microsoft and Apple this week to become the world's largest publicly traded company.\nBut while short-term catalysts help explain the euphoria surrounding AI and Nvidia, tangible long-term headwinds are mounting that suggest the world's hottest artificial intelligence stock is in an irrational bubble that could, eventually, push it out of the trillion-dollar market cap club.\nNo company has more directly benefited from the AI revolution than Nvidia. The company's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have, in short order, become the standard in AI-accelerated enterprise data centers. Nvidia's hardware is effectively the \"brains\" behind the split-second decision-making and computational power needed to train large language models and run generative AI solutions.\nRecently, the semiconductor analysts at TechInsights released data showing that 3.85 million GPUs were shipped in 2023. Nvidia was responsible for 3.76 million (98%) of these shipments. This makes it easier to understand why the company's Data Center segment more than quintupled sales in the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28), compared to the prior-year period.\nMoreover, demand has completely overwhelmed the available supply of AI-GPUs. When the demand for a good or service swamps supply, it's normal for the price of that good or service to meaningfully increase. It's not uncommon to see H100 GPUs selling for around $30,000, which has lifted Nvidia's adjusted gross margin to a scorching-hot 78.4%!\nNvidia's first-mover advantages are helping it on the innovation front as well. With rivals attempting to play catch-up with the H100, Nvidia has been busy developing its next-generation AI-GPU architecture. It unveiled Blackwell in March, which it'll begin rolling out in the second half of the current calendar year, as well as Rubin, which was revealed in June and is expected to be released in 2026. On a compute basis, catching Nvidia could prove challenging for its external competition.\nWith Nvidia blowing the doors off of Wall Street's sales and growth expectations for more than a year, it's understandable why the fear of missing out (FOMO) has taken hold among investors. Unfortunately, the combination of FOMO and next-big-thing investment trends has historically been a train wreck waiting to happen.\nThe single biggest enemy for Nvidia and its shareholders is history. While history shows that the major stock indexes rise over long periods, it's also quite clear that next-big-thing investment trends undergo a maturation process that involves a bubble-bursting event.\nSince the mid-1990s, every touted game-changing technology, innovation, or trend has resulted in an early-stage bubble. While not a comprehensive list, this includes the internet, businesses-to-business commerce, genome decoding, nanotechnology, housing, China stocks, 3D printing, cannabis, blockchain technology, augmented reality, and the metaverse. Without fail, investors always overestimate the uptake of these game-changing innovations/trends by consumers and businesses, which leads to lofty expectations not being met. It would be foolish (with a small \"f\") to expect AI to change this trend.\nTo add fuel to the fire, most businesses lack a blueprint of how they're going to utilize artificial intelligence to grow their sales. While many of the most influential businesses in America are investing in AI solutions because that's the hot thing to do right now, it's not really moving the needle for a majority of these businesses (outside of hardware players like Nvidia). Every technology needs time to mature, and AI isn't anywhere close to being a mature innovation at this stage of the game.\nCompetition is another clear problem. Even if Nvidia retains its GPU compute advantages over its peers, the company appears destined to lose share. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are both rolling out their AI-GPUs designed to directly compete with the H100 in AI-accelerated data centers. With demand grossly overwhelming supply for Nvidia's chips, AMD and Intel should have no trouble earning share from impatient enterprise customers.\nAs I've pointed out on countless occasions, Nvidia's competition is also internal. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet comprise roughly 40% of Nvidia's net sales.\nWhile it's fantastic that Nvidia can call the world's most influential businesses its top customers, it's equally concerning that Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet are internally developing AI-GPUs for their respective data centers. Once again, Nvidia can maintain its competitive compute advantage and still lose if these four companies choose to lean on their own chips and lessen their reliance on the largest publicly traded company by market cap.\nAs the sheer number of AI-GPUs deployed increases, the scarcity that's powered the selling price of the H100 into the stratosphere is going to ebb. In other words, it's a scenario for Nvidia's adjusted gross margin to retrace back to historic norms.\nHaving witnessed similar scenarios play out numerous times with next-big-thing innovations over the last three decades, it's only logical to expect Nvidia's FOMO to wear off as well. When it does, which I expect to occur by or before 2026, Nvidia could struggle to remain a trillion-dollar company.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list titled\u00a010 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI \u201cValue Creation Opportunity\u201d. Since Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nUBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s (GWM) recently\u00a0published\u00a0a detailed report discussing different layers of the AI \u201cvalue chain,\u201d estimating the combined market value opportunity from the layers at $1.2 trillion by 2027.\nUBS segments the AI market into three layers \u2013\u00a0 Enabling Layer, Intelligence Layer and Application Layer. The enabling layer is what actually powers the AI ecosystem \u2014 infrastructure, GPUs, data centers, Cloud, servers. UBS further divided this layer into two segments,\u00a0 Infrastructure and Cloud. The firm expects a combined $516 billion revenue opportunity from the enabling layer by 2027.\nNext up is the intelligence layer, which acts as the brain of the entire AI ecosystem. Large language models and backed software systems sit at this layer. UBS estimates that this layer presents a $225 billion opportunity by 2027.\nThe third layer in the AI market highlighted by UBS is the application layer. This is where the end user comes in. Cloud, data centers, GPUs, LLMs and algorithms amount to nothing if the end user cannot benefit from their huge processing power. UBS said estimating monetization opportunity of this layer was the hardest since it\u2019s still in its very early stage. The application layer addresses actual AI software used by customers \u2014 think AI assistants, GitHub CoPilot, marketing, customer service software, etc. UBS expects a whopping $395 billion in revenue opportunities for the application layer by 2027.\nKey AI Predictions\nThe UBS report also made key \u201cpredictions\u201d about the AI landscape. The firm\u2019s analysts believe the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) could give rise to a \u201ccapex cycle\u201d that could \u201cinflate\u201d the AI investment bubble. UBS sees the dominance of a few companies in the AI industry will continue to be a reality moving forward, as it expects \u201cmonolithic players\u201d and \u201cAI foundries\u201d prevailing in the near future.\nBased on this report, let\u2019s take a look at the top companies that will directly benefit from this $1.16 trillion opportunity by 2027. For this article we analyzed UBS analysis and picked 10 stocks that are directly exposed to the three layers in the AI ecosystem highlighted by UBS in its latest report. These companies are positioned extremely well to benefit from the monetization opportunities in the enabling, intelligence and application layers of the AI market. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\nUBS believes Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to benefit from the $331 billion market opportunity in the AI Enabling layer, thanks to its GPUs. In the Cloud segment of the Enabling layer, UBS thinks Nvidia Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) DGX offering makes the company a promising player. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) DGX Cloud is a supercomputing service that gives enterprises access to software and infrastructure required to train advanced models for generative AI. It\u2019s a combination of servers and workstations for optimizing deep learning applications through the use of general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU).\nOn the Intelligence and Application layer of the AI value chain, UBS sees no notable catalyst for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nNVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest product announcements and its plans revealed at the Computex 2024 show that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts like NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and think its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will start shipping H200 in the second half of this year. At its GTC conference NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed three accelerators \u2013 B200, GB200 and GB200 NVL72. All of these products provide growth catalysts for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares and justify its P/E multiple of 71, given NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth expectation of over 100% this year and 32% next year. Based on 2026 EPS estimate set by Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 35.74, which makes the stock\u2019s valuation attractive given the growth catalysts it has.\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA): NVDA shares were our top contributor in the quarter following blowout 4Q results and 1Q guidance driven by strong data center sales. The company reported quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion, up 265% year-over-year, and EPS in the quarter of $5.16, up 487% year-over-year and 12% ahead of expectations. Revenue guidance for 1Q of $24 billion was 8% above very high expectations. The artificial intelligence arms race kicked-off by ChatGPT and Alphabet\u2019s Bard, among others, has generated tremendous demand for Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphic processors.\nOverall, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI \u201cValue Creation Opportunity\u201d. While we acknowledge the potential of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock?",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "All eyes were set on Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) fiscal 2025 first-quarter results (for the three months ended April 28), which were scheduled for release on May 22. And the company didn't disappoint. It handsomely crushed Wall Street's expectations and issued terrific guidance for the current quarter.\nThe health of the artificial intelligence (AI) market was a big reason why investors were waiting with bated breath for Nvidia's results. There have been concerns that Nvidia stock could be in a bubble, and that the company might not be able to sustain its outstanding growth thanks to increasing competition and a pullback in AI infrastructure spending.\nAfter all, Nvidia has been the prime beneficiary of the proliferation of AI as its chips have played a central role in helping train AI models such as ChatGPT and form the backbone of the AI services offered by major tech giants. The semiconductor specialist's results cement the fact that AI is not just hype, which is why its customers are pouring billions of dollars into its hardware.\nDoes this mean investors who have been skeptical about Nvidia's AI-driven future and have missed the stock's red-hot rally should start buying the stock now? Or is it too late for them to buy shares of a company that has soared a stunning 628% since the beginning of 2023?\nNvidia's revenue in fiscal Q1 skyrocketed 262% year over year to $26 billion. Meanwhile, the company's gross margin jumped 12 percentage points year over year to 78.9% thanks to the immense pricing power it enjoys in the AI chip market. As a result, Nvidia's adjusted earnings grew an incredible 461% year over year to $6.12 per share.\nAnalysts were expecting $5.59 per share in earnings from Nvidia on revenue of $24.6 billion. However, another quarter of terrific growth in the company's data center revenue helped it coast past estimates. More specifically, Nvidia's data center revenue shot up a whopping 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 87% of its top line.\nNvidia's management attributed this terrific growth to \"higher shipments of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform used for training and inferencing with large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications.\" What's worth noting is that Nvidia's Hopper platform is set to be succeeded by new chips based on the Blackwell architecture, but demand continues to head higher.\nThat's because Nvidia's CUDA software platform, which allows developers to \"speed up their applications by harnessing the power of GPU accelerators,\" has led to a 3x jump in AI inference workloads on the company's Hopper flagship processor, the H100. As a result, cloud service providers have been able to significantly lower their costs of running popular AI models.\nAnd now, Nvidia is all set to double down on the AI chip opportunity by bringing its Blackwell chips into full production. The company points out that the demand for its Blackwell processors \"is well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year.\"\nThe chipmaker enjoys an almost monopolistic position in the AI chip market with an estimated market share of 95% thanks to the technology lead it enjoys over rivals. Moreover, Nvidia's ability to speed up existing hardware with the CUDA software platform, which it offers for free, gives its customers the incentive to wait to get their hands on its chips.\nSo, it is not surprising to see that Nvidia's rivals haven't been able to gain much traction in the AI chip market despite the former's supply constraints. This also explains why Nvidia's outlook points toward another terrific year.\nThe company has guided for $28 billion in revenue in the current quarter, which would be a 107% increase from the year-ago period. Additionally, the company is projecting a non-GAAP (adjusted) gross margin of 75.5% for the current quarter, which would be a nice increase over the year-ago period's 71.2%. So, Nvidia is on track to deliver another quarter of impressive growth in revenue and earnings.\nMore importantly, the company's fiscal Q1 revenue and fiscal Q2 guidance suggest that it is on track to finish the first half of the year with $54 billion in revenue.\u00a0That's nearly 90% of the revenue the chipmaker delivered in fiscal 2024. Market research firm Omdia predicts\u00a0Nvidia could sell $87 billion worth of data center GPUs this year, and the segment's revenue in fiscal Q1 indicates that it is well on track to hit that mark.\nAll this indicates why Nvidia's revenue in fiscal 2025 is set to surpass $100 billion, followed by more gains over the next couple of years.\nNvidia stock is currently trading at 62 times trailing earnings, which is a discount to its five-year average earnings multiple of 67. There is no doubt that the stock is richly valued compared to the U.S. technology sector's average of 42, but the pace at which it is growing justifies its valuation. As the following chart indicates, Nvidia's bottom-line growth has simply taken off in the past year, allowing it to justify its price-to-earnings ratio.\nAdditionally, Nvidia's forward earnings multiple of 43 points toward more growth in the company's bottom line. That's not surprising considering how rapidly Nvidia's data center business is forecast to grow in 2025. Investors, therefore, can still consider buying more shares of Nvidia as the booming demand for AI chips and the company's dominant position in this space could send this AI stock even higher.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n See our latest analysis for NVIDIA \nStrong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. So for many budding investors, improving EPS is considered a good sign. It is awe-striking that NVIDIA's EPS went from US$1.93 to US$17.33 in just one year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. NVIDIA shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 17% to 60%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\nWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for NVIDIA?\nOwing to the size of NVIDIA, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$107b. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.\nNVIDIA's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering NVIDIA for a spot on your watchlist. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 1 warning sign for NVIDIA that you should be aware of.\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Stock splits can be exciting for retail investors, particularly those whose brokerages might not offer them the option of purchasing fractional shares. I have lost count of the number of non-finance people suddenly asking me about Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock now that it's trading for \"just\" $130 a share.\nBut while splits can make a stock appear cheaper, they have no impact on a company's valuations -- how the market prices it relative to sales, earnings, etc. -- nor on its market cap, which is the value of all its outstanding shares combined. In the case of Nvidia, that market cap is $3.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world today, just a hair behind the one that makes iPhones.\nIs Nvidia stock still a buy at its current lofty market cap? Here are two reasons to continue hitting the buy button and one reason to consider jumping ship.\nIt has only been around two years since OpenAI took the world by storm with ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot capable of producing high-quality responses to user queries based on training data. Analysts are feverishly optimistic about the AI industry's potential, with Bloomberg Intelligence estimating it could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032.\nIf that forecast proves close to accurate, this will be an incredible opportunity for Nvidia, which is the leading maker of the specific types of powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to run and train these advanced algorithms. Currently, it holds a market share of more than 80% in that hot niche, where demand is outstripping supply.\nWhile Nvidia will face growing competition from rival chipmakers such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel, it's protecting its market share via software solutions like CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a computing platform and programming interface that's bespoke for use with its hardware, and by constantly improving its offerings. According to CEO Jensen Huang, the company will henceforth release a new family of updated AI chips every single year (up from its prior pace of once every two years), making it even harder for rivals to keep up.\nThe second bullish fact about Nvidia is its valuation. Despite rising by over 3,000% in the last five years, shares are still reasonably priced relative to the company's remarkable growth rate.\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 48, Nvidia's shares are not much more expensive than other popular AI hardware stocks like AMD, which has a P/E of 47. To put this in context, in the first quarter, AMD's sales grew by just 2% year over year, while Nvidia's exploded by 262%.\nThis valuation suggests Nvidia's stock could have more room to run if the AI industry lives up to analysts' expectations. But hold your horses -- there is one big risk factor new investors should be aware of.\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) is a computer hardware company that sold the routers and switches needed to build out the internet in the late 1990s. It was the \"picks and shovels\" way for investors to bet on what the smart money saw as a transformative new industry. And by the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, Cisco's market cap had hit $500 billion. Then the bubble burst, and it dropped by a staggering 88% within two years. The stock still hasn't recovered to its previous highs.\nInvestors should take this as a cautionary tale, because Nvidia occupies a similar role in the AI space today, and any hit to its growth rate or pricing power could lead to a rapid collapse in its valuation, just like what happened to Cisco. While Nvidia investors have a lot to be excited about, they should also be aware of the potential risks this company faces before buying the stock, especially at its current valuation.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $808,105!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "Hedge Funds Are Crazy About NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other hedge fund-approved stocks.\nInvesting, broadly speaking, narrows down to two strategies. These see an investor decide whether to buy a stock for the short term and make quick profits or hold it for years to patiently wait for the returns to accrue. One of the most successful investor of our times, Warren Buffett (see his latest portfolio), is an ardent follower of the latter approach, and his wealth bears testament to his success.\nOf course, deciding to pick the right stocks to sit on for years isn't easy or else everyone would be rich by now. However, there are ways in which one can gain an edge over others. One such way is to see what the professionals are doing and then emulate their strategy. At Insider Monkey, we get right at the heart of investing by picking out the top stocks that hedge funds are investing in. Why hedge fund stock picks? Well, these professionals, who almost often charge an arm and a leg for their services, conduct extensive due diligence to pick out the right set of stocks. After all, no one would invest with a hedge fund if the fund was simply picking stocks by flipping a coin.\nYet, while due diligence is great and necessary to protect investors, investing, at the end of the day, is all about returns. By the looks of it, the funds do seem to know what they're doing. Last year, the top ten hedge fund stock picks ended up outperforming the S&P benchmark stock index by 48.9 percentage points. In other words, while the index returned 26.1% in 2023, the top ten stocks returned 75.1% through price gains. This trend is also present in the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2023 as these posted 53.2% in gains to outperform the S&P by 27 percentage points. Unsurprisingly, year to May 29th, the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2024 led the S&P's 11% and posted 20.2% in gains.\nUnfortunately, though, data shows that as of 2021 end, 14% of the stock market was made of active funds while 16% was accounted for by passive funds. Compared to passive funds accounting for 8% of the market a decade ago with 20% belonging to active funds, it's clear that the broader public believes that shifting to passive is a safer investment approach. After all, while everyone wants to make money, no one wants to lose it either.\nBut what if one could make their own investing decisions and gain an inside track to investing by figuring out what stocks most hedge funds have invested in? Well, at Insider Monkey we regularly compile data from more than 900 hedge funds to see where the smart money is headed. This is how we know that the top hedge fund stocks outperformed the benchmark index last year, and it's also a strategy that's helped us beat the market over the last 10 years. Compared to the SPY's 235.6% in returns between 2014 and May 2024, the 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 463.7%.\nBut wait. At this point, you could argue that since hedge fund SEC filings come with a 45 day lag, perhaps they aren't that important. After all, it might be more important to know what the funds are doing now. Well, since we've been compiling top hedge fund stocks since 2012 in our quarterly newsletter, we can guarantee you that the top hedge fund stocks haven't changed by much since 2018. So not only isn't the time lag that significant, but by subscribing to our newsletter, you can gain an early track to see which stocks are falling out of favor among the funds as well.\nSo, all this talk about the top hedge fund stocks might make you wonder about the stocks themselves. Curious? Check out the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. We also cover legendary investors through pieces such as Warren Buffett\u2019s 12 Longest Held Stocks.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the top ten hedge fund stocks, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900+ hedge fund filings for Q1 2024 and picked out the stocks with the highest number of investors.\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 186\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the darling of Wall Street and the tech world right now. Key to the firm's success, particularly in the AI sphere, is its CUDA platform which enables customers to speed up their computing applications solely on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s platform. CUDA, along with leading edge chip manufacturing technologies from chip contract manufacturer TSMC, are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s key moats as they help ensure that its products are industry leaders in performance despite similar silicon being available from both Intel and AMD.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s competitive moat and the potential for its largest customers like Alphabet and Microsoft to develop their own AI chips was also on the mind of well known investment firm Harding Loevner in its Q1 2024 investor letter. A classic contrarian move, Loevner exited its NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stake in the quarter, and its note mentions key reasons such as difficulty in estimating the \"ultimate size of the total addressable market.\" The full note is too long to share here and merits a complete read. Here's one relevant snippet:\nWhile NVIDIA is expected by many to capture the lion\u2019s share of this market for years to come, history tells us that it becomes increasingly difficult for a stock to outperform when expectations are so high. At the advent of the commercial internet, Cisco Systems, which makes the networking equipment that enables much of the internet, occupied a similarly strategic vantage point for the new era. By March 2000, it was the world\u2019s most valuable company. Cisco and its investors were right about the internet: it did change everything. The company\u2019s routers remain a key piece of infrastructure. However, Cisco\u2019s stock price tumbled 88% from its peak and took 20 years to recover. The earnings growth implied by the price investors were willing to pay took longer to arrive than the novelty of the technology took to capture their imagination.\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best hedge fund-approved stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now to see the other hedge fund-approved stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA\u00a0and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "On Jun 5, the stock price of the undisputed global leader of the generative artificial intelligence (AI) market, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA jumped 5.2% to $1,224.40, touching a new all-time high. NVIDIA also crossed the $3 trillion market capital threshold for the first time.\nDriven by NVIDIA\u2019s gain, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed at 17,187.92, advancing 2%, marking a fresh all-time high. Wall Street\u2019s broad-market benchmark \u2014 the S&P 500 Index \u2014 rose 1.2% to finish at a new closing high of 5,354.03. Moreover, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) climbed 4.5% to end at 5,347.44, also marking an all-time closing high. In intraday trading, the index hit an all-time high of 5,348.91.\nOn Jun 2, at the Computex technology trade show in Taipei, NVIDIA unveiled its new AI chip architecture called \u201cRubin\u201d. Notably, in March, the generative AI chipset giant announced its upcoming AI platform called \u201cBlackwell.\u201d This shows, severe competition in this space as industry leaders are busy upgrading their offerings in a record-low time.\nOn May 22, CEO Jensen Huang said that the company\u2019s next-generation AI chip, Blackwell, is the upcoming driver. These chips will be available in data centers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Huang said, \u201cWe will see a lot of Blackwell revenue this year.\u201d These chips are essential for customers\u2019 interconnected infrastructure.\nThe Rubin architecture will have new GPUs to launch AI systems, CPUs and networking chips. It will also have new features like a central processor called \u201cVera\u201d. Rubin is set to be introduced in 2026.\nOn May 22, NVIDIA reported that blockbuster first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues of $26.04 billion, soared 262% year over year, marking the third straight quarter of growth in excess of 200%. The metric also exceeds the consensus estimate of $24.33 billion.\nAdjusted earnings per share were $6.12, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.49. This compares to earnings of $1.09 per share a year ago. NVIDIA expects sales of $28 billion in the fiscal second quarter. NVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nThe AI market has gathered pace in the past few years buoyed by the rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet. Despite an improving supply of AI chipsets, demand is likely to outpace supply, resulting in price hikes for chips. The market for AI is expected to show strong growth in the coming decade. Its current size of $200-$300 billion is expected to grow to nearly $2 trillion by 2030, as estimated by several research agencies.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers International Ltd. estimated that AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030. Of this, $6.6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion is likely to come from consumption-side effects.\nHere we will discuss four stocks that are likely to benefit from the massive explosion of AI-based processers.\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD is benefiting from portfolio strength and an expanding partner base. Data Center revenues benefited from the strong adoption of AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs and a double-digit percentage increase in CPU sales. In cloud, server CPU revenues increased year over year and sequentially as North American hyperscalers expanded fourth Gen EPYC Processor deployments to power their internal workloads and public instances.\nOn Jun 3, at the Computex technology trade show in Taipei, AMD introduced its latest AI-based MI325X processor to be marketed in fourth-quarter 2024. AMD also unveiled an upcoming series of chips titled MI350. This new chip platform is expected to perform 35 times better in inference compared to its currently available MI300 series of AI chips. MI350 is expected to be available in 2025.\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) Advanced Micro Devices has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.5% and 29.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 30 days. On Jun 5, the stock price of AMD surged 3.9%.\nMicron Technology Inc. MU produces memory chips used in NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs and other AI-based chipsets. The enormous growth of AI applications boosted demand for MU\u2019s high bandwidth memory chips. MU is benefiting from improved market conditions, robust sales executions and strong growth across multiple business units.\nMU anticipates the pricing of DRAM and NAND chips to increase, thereby improving its revenues. The pricing benefits will primarily be driven by rising AI servers, causing a scarcity in the availability of cutting-edge DRAM and NAND supplies. Also, 5G adoption in IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for memory and storage.\nZacks Rank #2 (Buy) Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 58.4% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.3% over the last seven days. On Jun 5, the stock price of MU climbed 5.6%.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM is one of the largest manufacturers of NVIDIA\u2019s chipsets along with other major AI-based chipset developers. TSM provides a range of wafer fabrication processes, including processes to manufacture complementary metal- oxide-semiconductor logic, mixed-signal, radio frequency, embedded memory, bipolar CMOS mixed-signal, and others.\nTSM also offers customer and engineering support services, manufactures masks, and invests in technology start-up companies. It researches, designs, develops, manufactures, packages, tests, and sells color filters, and provides investment services. TSM\u2019s products are used in high-performance computing, smartphones, the Internet of Things, automotive and digital consumer electronics.\nZacks Rank #3 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 22% and 18.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days. On Jun 5, the stock price of TSM jumped 6.9%.\nQUALCOMM Inc. QCOM is benefiting from the development of Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows in collaboration with Microsoft boosting commercial prospects in the AI PC market. QCOM AI Hub is witnessing significant market traction among leading global PC manufacturers.\nOn Jun 5, Kneron \u2014 a Taiwanese AI-based chipset startup backed by QCOM and iPhone assembler Foxconn \u2014 introduced its latest AI-chip KNEO 330, its second-generation \u201cedge GPT\u201d server.\nThe major feature of KNEO 330 is that it aimed at businesses wishing to run their own AI applications from their own premises rather than relying on outside servers owned by third-party big cloud service providers.\nKneron also unveiled its latest KL830 processor chip will be in a new PC. This chip will enable the PC to run AI applications on the device rather than connecting to the Internet.

This ambitious forecast hinges on the upcoming release of the successor to Nvidia's Blackwell chips.\nNavellier downplays recent news of antitrust investigations into Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI by the Justice Department and FTC. Citing a Wall Street Journal report, Navellier noted that these investigations \"may ultimately come to nothing\" and will not impede the progress of Artificial Intelligence.\nA key factor in Nvidia's dominance, according to Navellier, is its substantial investment in next-generation generative AI chips. He claims that Nvidia's $2 billion expenditure renders competitor efforts \"increasingly futile\" due to Nvidia's superior technology.\nNavellier goes as far as to suggest Nvidia is single-handedly leading the stock market, prompting Bloomberg TV to declare the S&P 500's \"Magnificent Seven\" has become \"the Magnificent One and 499 other stocks.\"\nRelated Articles\nNavellier sees Nvidia market cap hitting $5 trillion in 2025\nParamount special committee meets to vote on Skydance deal, Bloomberg News reports\nJohnson & Johnson reaches $700 million talc settlement with US states\n"

        "Author": "  Viktor Zarev ",
        "Text": "As Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth goes hyperbolic, the semiconductor industry seems left behind. After all, much of Nvidia\u2019s excitement and value generation comes from its dominance in the graphic process unit sector of semiconductor technology. However, Nvidia is a fabless company. This means it relies on highly sophisticated manufacturers, which, in turn, rely on suppliers to produce the GPUs that drive Nvidia\u2019s market dominance. With Nvidia\u2019s growth looking unlikely to slow down, according to analysts, keeping an eye on where it spends its money could be lucrative.\nFurthermore, this means there\u2019s money to invest in the supply chain that puts Nvidia\u2019s products on the market. That\u2019s because Nvidia is a rising tide, raising several stocks alongside it and bolstering the value of the S&P 500. As such, here are three semiconductor stocks to buy due to their close relationship with how Nvidia dominates the market.\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\nNvidia\u2019s premier partner in chipmaking, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), has seen its value grow due to its relationship with Nvidia. Through its mastery of various semiconductor and microchip fabrication processes, TSM has become an asset to the tech industry beyond NVDA.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nIts reputation for exceptional quality, timeliness and efficacy has kept major firms returning for repeat orders worldwide. Of even higher importance, the company has continued to improve the nanometer size of its manufacturing offerings, going from seven nanometers to two in just five years. This is exceptionally important as the smaller the manufacturing process, the more transistors it can fit on a wafer, making the resulting chip more computationally powerful.\nWith this push for innovation, TSM remains on the leading edge of the semiconductor manufacturing industry, which keeps its customers coming back while recruiting new ones with novel technological designs.\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\nAmong the critical web of suppliers to Nvidia\u2019s product, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) has continued to impress investors. Though its recent Q2 2024 earnings report saw minimal revenue growth year-over-year (YOY), the company rewarded shareholders with a boost to its earnings per share. Yet, this temporary slowdown in growth is more likely an aspect of AMAT waiting for demand to catch up to its supply.\nMoreover, AMAT\u2019s Applied Global Services division reported its 19th quarter of YOY revenue growth. This news came alongside another record quarterly revenue for the division, hinting at its importance to the company\u2019s business model. That\u2019s because the company\u2019s 17,000 machines earn recurring revenues through maintenance fees like Taiwan Semiconductor at all of its customers. These maintenance services also boast a 90% contract renewal rate.\nFor investors looking for the best semiconductor stocks to buy, AMAT represents a strong position as a supplier and maintainer of the industry\u2019s building blocks.\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\nOne of the biggest innovators in chipmaking technology, ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML) specializes in the extreme engineering needed to create nanometer-level manufacturing. The company commands the market for photolithography machines by continuously pushing the edges of what is physically possible in semiconductor manufacturing.\nSpecifically, the company\u2019s newest machine, the high-NA extreme ultraviolet system, is proving to be a strong revenue opportunity. For example, ASML recently confirmed selling and shipping a $380 million high-NA extreme ultraviolet machine to TSMC. This machine allows for transistor lines of the highest precision to be printed onto semiconductor boards, further cementing its importance to the industry\u2019s future as the push to get smaller and more powerful processors forces its necessity.\nFurthermore, some analysts are predicting another $6.13 billion in the remaining three quarters of 2024, which could push ASML\u2019s sales to $43 billion for the year. This would mark a 48% increase over 2023\u2019s full-year sales of $29 billion.\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\nMusk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.\nOn May 20, 2019, NVDA was added to the Zacks Focus List at $3.91 per share.

NVDA also boasts an average earnings surprise of 18.4%.\nAdditionally, Nvidia's earnings are expected to grow 106.2% for the current fiscal year.\nBecause stock prices react to revisions, buying stocks with rising earnings estimates can be very profitable.

        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) became the number one company in terms of market valuation and it can now become \u201cnumber on-er,\u201d Truist Securities analysts said in a Wednesday note.\nOn June 18, Nvidia\u2019s market cap climbed to $3.34 trillion, overtaking Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the world\u2019s most valuable public company. However, the chipmaker\u2019s shares then fell in several consecutive sessions, losing the top position.\n\u201cWe considered that, even if fundamentals cooperate, stock upside could be limited owing to trading and technical challenges related to NVDA's #1 market cap position,\u201d Truist analysts wrote.\nHowever, the firm said its comprehensive analysis of the data indicates \u201cthat becoming the largest company by market cap does not appear to systematically challenge future investment returns.\u201d\nTruist evaluated the investment returns and valuations of stocks that have achieved the largest market capitalization over the past 26 years. These stocks include Microsoft, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\nThe analysis revealed that most of these stocks underperformed relative to the S&P 500 index over short-term periods of one week, one month, and three months following their initial ascent to the top market cap position. However, in the longer term, the stocks generally outperformed the S&P 500 over one-year, three-year, and five-year periods, the investment bank noted.\nOverall, analysts continue to view NVDA as the top choice for investing in the AI theme. Citing recent feedback from industry contacts, including component buyers and sellers, they note that there is ongoing and broadening demand for Nvidia's GPU systems. While Blackwell systems are particularly favored, Hopper systems are also being well received.\nWithin this, the investment bank raised its price target on NVDA shares from $128 to $140.\nRelated Articles\nTruist raises Nvidia stock target: 'Number one can become number one-er'\nRivian investors to seek details on path to profits at investor day\nHedge funds 'aggressively' sold tech stocks in June - Goldman Sachs\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia Just Announced a Stock Split. History Says This Is What Happens Next.",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was already the hottest stock on the market, but investor interest in the AI chip leader is reaching a fever pitch ahead of its 10-for-1 stock split, which is set to take effect after the markets close June 7. The first post-split trading day will then be June 10.\nNvidia already delivered blockbuster returns for investors who bought the stock early in the generative AI cycle. Since the start of 2023, it has jumped nearly 700%, and some investors believe the stock split could fuel even more gains.\nIs there evidence that stock splits are positive triggers for share prices? Let's see what history has to say about that -- but first, let's review the basics of a stock split.\nA stock split occurs when individual shares are divided into more shares that are worth proportionally less. For example, in a 2-for-1 split, the number of shares an investor holds would double, but the price of those shares would be cut in half. In the case of Nvidia's 10-for-1 split, investors will own 10 times the number of shares they did previously, but each of those shares will be worth 10% of what they were before the split.\nIt's important for investors to recognize that stock splits don't change the fundamentals of the business or a stock in any way -- like, say, a dividend would. A split does lower the nominal price of a stock, making individual shares cheaper, but it doesn't affect the valuation since it also reduces earnings per share by the same percentage.\nWhile splits don't change a company's fundamentals, there is at least some evidence that they are correlated with outperformance.\nAccording to a frequently cited study from Bank of America, stocks that split their shares historically returned an average of 25% over the 12 months after the split is announced, compared to just a 12% total return for the S&P 500.\nIt's worth noting that stock splits historically correlate with bull markets. That makes sense since prices need to go up in order for a company to decide to split its shares.\nDuring the dot-com era, splits were rampant, and any that were announced in the year before the bubble started to collapse in March of 2000 would have likely helped drive the overall outperformance in BofA's research.\nHowever, the bank's research team said that the edge from stock splits persisted even in more challenging markets such as the 2000s, which included both the dot-com bubble bursting and the housing bubble popping, leading to the financial crisis.\nThere was also a high degree of variability among the results of the stocks that were split. For example, 30% of companies that announced splits fell over the following year, meaning that a split is far from a guarantee of outperformance.\nAmong Nvidia's \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, results have also been underwhelming following their recent splits despite the generally strong results of these same stocks:\nApple did a 4-for-1 split on Aug. 28, 2020. Over the next year, the stock returned 20% but underperformed the S&P 500's total return of 30%.\nAmazon executed a 20-for-1 split on June 6, 2022, but its stock gained just 2% over the next year, compared to a 6% gain for the S&P 500.\nAlphabet followed Amazon with its own 20-for-1 stock split on July 15, 2022, but also underperformed the S&P 500 over the next year, rising 12% compared to a total return of 19% for the broad-market index.\nTesla\u00a0split 3-for-1 on Aug. 25, 2022, but fell 19% over the next year while the S&P 500 gained 7%.\nDespite BofA's findings, buying a stock only because of an upcoming split is generally not a good idea, as the recent underperformance of the four stocks above helps illustrate.\nOther factors like a business' competitive advantages, valuation, and growth opportunities are more important to evaluate than the stock split itself.\nBut splits tend to emerge at a point of strength rather than weakness, and that seems to apply to Nvidia right now. The company is reporting blockbuster growth in revenue and profit and remains ahead of the competition in the fast-growing market for AI GPUs and related hardware.\nThe stock split might be a nice bonus for investors, but the real reason to buy Nvidia stock is its dominance in generative AI hardware, and its growth potential as the AI market continues to develop.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation A Good Quality Stock to Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled the list of the 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy according to the hedge funds using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0stands against the other quality stocks.\nInvesting in 2024 is significantly different from investing in the 1950s and onward. This is because these days investors have to. sift through thousands of stocks and countless data points and signals to separate the wheat from the chaff and make the right investment decisions. Amidst this hubris, the ability to pick out 'quality' stocks becomes important, and there's quite a lot of financial literature available that helps determine what such stocks are.\nTypically, stock analysis involves analyzing a firm's financial statements to determine profitability, operating strengths, cost control, asset utilization, and other metrics. Some of these are also present in financial literature that discusses quality stocks. One such research paper comes courtesy of researchers associated with Research Affiliates. They point out that metrics that typically define a quality stock include earnings stability, capital structure, profitability, accounting practices, and investing strategies. Within these, the quality factors that were also related to returns were investment strategies, dividend payouts, profitability, and accounting strategies.\nThe next thing to ask is, whether quality stocks are any different from standard run of the mill stocks when it comes to share price performance. For context, the last 12 months on the stock market have been dominated by a few key themes. These are artificial intelligence, inflation, interest rates, and GDP growth. Higher rates and inflation are bearish stock indicators, while growth and AI have proven to have kept the market buoyant at a time when rates are at two decade high levels. So, over the past year, exchange traded funds that track quality stocks have appreciated by 12% to 27%, the midpoint of which is slightly lower than the S&P 500's 23% price appreciation over the same time period. However, picking the right quality stocks appears to have its advantages as well, since the high end of the performance, i.e. 27%, is far higher than what the index has delivered.\nETFs and research aren't the only ones that talk about quality stocks. One hedge fund that's become quite well known for its focus on quality stocks is Cliff Asness\u2019 AQR Capital Management. One of the largest hedge funds in the world, AQR had a 13F investment portfolio worth $58 billion as of Q1 2024 end according to Insider Monkey's research. Close to a quarter of its portfolio is invested in the technology industry, and the second biggest category is services stocks. AQR focuses on stocks that follow its strategy of Quality Minus Junk or QMJ. According to its founder Cliff Asness, a quality stock is defined by its shareholder payouts, growth, profitability, and sound financial and general management. We recently took a look at some top AQR Capital management stocks and you can check them out by looking at 13 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness.\nBefore we head to our list of the best quality stocks, a general overview of the stock market is relevant. Right now, investors are wondering when the first interest rate cuts might occur. The latest bit on this front came in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data from the Commerce Department. This data set revealed that the 12 month inflation in the US stood at 2.7% in April 2024, which was still higher than the Fed's preferred rate of 2%. Additionally, the data also provided investors with some bearish signals. These were apparent in the readings for consumer spending, which slowed down to 2% in the first quarter of 2024 over the robust 3.3% reading in Q4 2023.\nLower spending means less money sloshing in the economy, and while this might help reduce prices, it can also affect business performance, economic growth, and naturally, stock market performance. Data from the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that 47% of all investors polled expect a 25 basis point rate cut in September, while an additional 7.5% believe that the Fed might get generous and cut rates by as much as 50 basis points.\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top quality stocks that hedge funds are buying.\nMethodology\nTo make our list of the best quality stocks to buy, we ranked the 30 largest constituents of a quality stock ETF and picked out those with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q1 2024. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 186\nChip designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the most popular AI stock. The start of June 2024 was an important time for the firm as CEO Jensen Huang shared that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) isn't stopping with its AI chips and will launch a new Blackwell Ultra chip in 2025. Blackwell is the firm's latest AI chip platform, and H200 chips were slated to start shipments in Q2. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s latest bit of AI announcements expand on industrial uses cases of the new technology. At Computex in Taiwan, the firm revealed that NVIDIA's\u00a0 AI Enterprise-IGX will now be paired with its sensor processing platform called Holoscan. NVIDIA IGX's latest refresh boosts its AI processing capability to 1,705 trillion operations per second, allowing use cases such as astronomy and medical imaging to utilize greater computing capacities.\nBy Q1 2024 end, 186 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey's research were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stakeholders. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners held the most valuable stake which was worth $12 billion.\nGiven that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have gained a massive 1,756% over the past four years, the question everyone's asking is is there any growth left? Its revenue has grown from $16 billion in 2021 to $79 billion over the last 12 months, but NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s price to forward earnings ratio is 42.19 - just 2x of the S&P 500's 21. Whether the Blackwell Ultra pushes the forward P/E down remains to be seen. Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund was able to keenly differentiate between the broader cyclical nature of the chip industry and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s unique platform level strengths in its Q1 2024 investor letter where it shared:\nIt is not lost on us that semiconductors is a notoriously cyclical industry. Historically, the hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.), who are among NVIDIA\u2019s largest customers, have not invested/spent/consumed CapEx in a straight line. It will be more than a mild surprise then if there was no pullback in demand leading to a significant growth deceleration and a potentially meaningful correction in the price of the stock, sometime in the near future. So, it is incumbent upon us to manage the size of this investment appropriately, while continuing to imagine what the future will likely look like without losing sight of what reality on the ground is today.\nOverall, NVDA ranks 4th among the 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy now. You can visit 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy to see the other quality stocks that are on the hedge fund radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that there are other AI stocks that hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
