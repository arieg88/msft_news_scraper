0,2024-10-13 19:55:55+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Hedge Funds Are Bullish On This Profitable Blue Chip Stock Right Now,  Affan Mir ,"We recently compiled a list of the 8 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other profitable blue chip stocks.
The September inflation report came in hotter than expected and showed that it remains sticky. Headline inflation rose by 2.4%, slightly above the anticipated 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. Month-over-month, CPI increased by 0.2%, exceeding the forecast of 0.1%.
Core inflation, excluding food and energy, also came in higher than expected at 3.3%, compared to the anticipated 3.2%, marking a slight increase from August. On a monthly basis, core CPI rose by 0.3%, which matched August’s figures but was above expectations of 0.2%.
Following the report, the market is expecting a 25 basis points rate cut to no rate cuts in the upcoming Fed meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 79.9% of interest rate traders expect the rate cuts to be at 450-475 bps at the coming Fed meeting while 20.1% expect the rate cut to stay the same. At the beginning of the month, 32.1% expected a 50 bps rate cut, while 67.9% anticipated a 25 bps cut.
Despite the sticky inflation, IBM's vice chair, Gary Cohn believes that the Fed will cut rates by 100 bps this year. In an interview at CNBC's ‘Money Movers', he suggested that the U.S. is experiencing what a soft landing looks like, with inflation decreasing but not steadily. He indicated that reaching the Fed's 2% target will be challenging, as inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around this level.
Cohn noted that for the first time in nearly two decades, the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate, employment, and price stability, after focusing primarily on one at a time. He believes the Fed is making the right decisions and is currently in a delicate position as it missed meeting opportunities this year.
Cohn expects that the Fed will implement a total of 100 basis points in rate cuts this year, likely consisting of 25 basis point reductions over the next couple of months. When asked about inflation targets, he expressed a preference for slightly exceeding the target inflation rate, suggesting that a rate of around 2.2% would be more acceptable in a growing economy than undershooting the target.
Cohn also highlighted concerns about geopolitical risks and said that global tensions could lead to inflationary pressures by disrupting supply chains and increasing shipping costs.
Our Methodology
For this article, we use stock screeners to identify nearly 30 stocks above $100 billion market cap and $10 billion TTM net income. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks that had a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate of above 10% and were most widely held by institutional investors. The most profitable blue chip stocks are listed in ascending order of the hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of 912 hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the pioneers of personal computing and is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. It aims to make digital technology and AI accessible to everyone worldwide.
It offers a wide range of products and services, including cloud solutions, software applications, and hardware devices. Its research and development focus on improving productivity and business processes, building smart cloud and edge platforms, and creating more personalized computing experiences.
Moreover, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also maintains data centers to expand capacity for growing AI service demands. Most products are manufactured by third-party contractors, which offers flexibility, though some components rely on a limited number of suppliers, which could disrupt production. Its internal research and development spans several groups, including Cloud and AI, Security, and Gaming, allowing the company to maintain competitive advantages.
Over the last few quarters, the company has taken over a huge part of the AI market and its products are being widely used by other companies. Its tools like Copilots and the Azure OpenAI Service have gained widespread adoption, with 60% of Fortune 500 companies implementing Copilots and 65% using Azure OpenAI Service.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also one of the best AI datacenter stocks. In 2023, the company increased its AI data center spending by 50%, surpassing Amazon's 3% decrease. The company partnered with BlackRock to create a $100 billion fund for AI data center growth and pledged over $4 billion for AI infrastructure in Italy. Reports show that Microsoft is set to double its data center capacity to 5 gigawatts this year. It is one of the most profitable blue chip stocks to invest in.
Generation Investment Management stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Generative AI’s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI’s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called ‘inference’). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category – nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google’s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years.
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the most profitable blue chip stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.

Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. Goldman Sachs recently lowered the price target on the stock to $500 from $515 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The investment firm slightly lowered free cash flow expectations after Microsoft's fiscal 2026 and 2027 artificial intelligence capex estimates. However, as Azure capacity comes online and AI revenue continues to scale, Microsoft should execute well against Goldman's expectations for 14% revenue growth, the advisory told investors in a research note. The investment firm said Microsoft’s earnings growth is still 300 basis points faster than the S&P 500, which justifies the stock's valuation.
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

2,2024-10-13 14:22:31+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Is A Goldman Sachs Phase 2 AI Stock For The Next AI Wave,  Ramish Cheema ,"We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. In this piece, we will look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks among the list of Goldman Sachs' Phase 2 AI stocks.
While consumer technology stocks had soared in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, back then, their share price gains were due to. the growing demand for technology products and services due to lock downs. Now, big technology stocks have persisted in their strong performance despite high interest rates since they have been judged by the market as the top innovators and performers in the artificial intelligence industry.
Since AI is somewhat of a ubiquitous technology, its impact is on several industries. So far, we’ve seen most of the stock market returns related to AI directly tied to just one stock. This stock continued to be the fifth most trending AI stocks as recently as in mid October and its share price returns are nothing short of unbelievable. From its bottom in October 2022 when the split adjusted share price was a mere $11.23, the shares have gained a stunning 1,100%. In other words, if you had invested just $100 back then in the shares and then held onto them for dear life, your investment would be worth $1,200 today.
This is the magic of AI, a technology that has caught Wall Street and retail investors alike by storm. However, AI’s impact, and its enablement, aren’t limited to the GPU designer we’ve mentioned above. While GPUs are the ‘oil’ for this technology, a wide variety of other components from data center infrastructure, networking equipment, connectivity, and energy all will have to play their part if OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s plans of initially building as many as 7 AI data centers across the US, with each data center guzzling an unbelievable 5 Gigawatts of electricity, are to come to fruition.
This then makes us ask, what are such stocks that might enable 35 Gigawatts of AI data centers across the US? After all, in order to meet the world’s demand for AI chips, Altman believes that an unfathomable $7 trillion will need to be spent for building 36 chip manufacturing fabs and additional AI data centers. This money has to be spent somewhere, and therein lies the answer to our question. Things get clearer when we look at a detailed research report from investment bank Goldman Sachs. This report segregated the AI sector into four categories.
The first category only included Wall Street’s AI darling, the second was made of AI capacity providers like server companies, other semiconductor firms, and utilities, the third included firms that sell AI products and software, and the fourth category firms were those that will benefit from AI adoption. In its report, the investment bank shared that year to date in July, the first category had returned 139%. As of mid October, this category has gained 179% on the stock market, so safe to say returns have accelerated despite some turbulence in between. By July, the second group of firms was also doing well. Its returns ranged between ~-8% to ~50%, with the average stock having delivered 22%.
Zooming into these firms, the utility sector is one which had particularly impressed the bank. It shared that utilities were the best performing sector in the flagship S&P index between March and May courtesy of their 16% returns. Their three month returns ranked in the 98th percentile since 2022 and were the third highest after 2003 and 2020 rallies. This outperformance is unsurprising given the strong investments in data centers that have taken the US by storm this year.
These investments have led to estimates suggesting that America’s data center hub, Northern Virginia, will require 11,000 megawatts of electricity by 2035 – demand which has already spurred $5.2 billion in investments for transmission lines and coal fired power plants. Estimates from Boston Consulting Group believe that by 2030, AI will account for 16% of America’s energy consumption and touch 130 gigawatts. For a detailed look at the link between electricity use and data centers, you should read 15 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Jefferies, Citi and Wall Street Analysts.
The bustling optimism surrounding AI is also reflected in revenue estimates. Goldman’s September 2024 research shows that 2025 revenue estimates of semiconductor firms, software enablers, and hardware firms except semiconductors are roughly 2.3x, 2.05x, and 1.8x over 2019 levels, respectively. Similarly, non semiconductor hardware companies have seen their revenue forecasts for Q4 2025 jump to $450 billion for a $380 billion gain over Q1 2024’s $70 billion. Makes us wonder whether it’s this group of companies that might see a stock mirror the 1,100% returns of Wall Street’s AI darling.
Our Methodology
To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ best phase 2 AI stocks, we ranked the 20 stocks with the highest year to date returns and some other big tech and data center names that have announced multi billion dollars in capital expenditure by their year to date performance.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the global leader in operating systems and one of the biggest players in the cloud and enterprise computing industry. It is also one of the leading players in the AI industry due to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s multi billion dollar investment in AI means that it is entitled to a share of OpenAI’s revenue, and the firm’s Azure cloud computing platform is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new technology. Through Azure, the company enables customers to store, analyze, and run other operations with their data. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s cloud raked in $28.5 billion in FYQ4 revenue, and its AI investments mean that investors are razor focused on its ability to generate AI profits. This is also why Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks at the bottom of our list, as a lack of profits has made its shares lose 2% since its fourth quarter report. Consequently, the ability to drive AI profits is key to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s hypothesis.
Baron Funds mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:
“Microsoft Corporation is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Oice products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Oice 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing.

Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.

Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.
As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

4,2024-10-11 22:14:58+00:00,Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella calls two CEOs a day: Here’s what he asks,  Marco Quiroz-Gutierrez ,"The CEO of one of the biggest companies in the world doesn’t let a day go by without checking in on his network.
After getting to the gym and practicing some gratitude early in the day, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also makes it a point to call two CEOs to ask them a couple of key questions, The Information reported.
The 57-year-old asks his staff to set up calls with important people, who range from executives like Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas to other prominent leaders like former Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll.
When he gets these important people on the phone (because who would ignore the leader of a $3 trillion company?), he likes to focus on two questions that help him expand his network even further.
First, he likes to ask, “What new startups are you excited about?” The question is essential since, under Nadella, Microsoft has not been afraid to put money into innovative ideas, as evidenced by the company’s $10 billion investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI in 2023.
Apart from the OpenAI investment, Microsoft reportedly invested $95 million into the humanoid-robotics startup Figure, which he was able to persuade to move to Microsoft Azure for AI infrastructure and training, Reuters reported. The company’s venture arm put an additional $25 million into database tech startup Neon earlier this year.
These deals are a trademark of the way Nadella has run Microsoft since he ascended to the top job in 2014. While he took the helm at a time when the company was struggling, Nadella helped turn things around in part through his openness to partnerships and working with other companies when it’s beneficial.
“You have to be open-minded that at the end of the day, sometimes partnerships are the only way to get ahead,” Nadella said of the OpenAI partnership to the Stratechery newsletter in May.
Nadella’s second question has to do with expanding his personal network: “What new people have you met that would be good to know?”
This question keeps Nadella on the pulse of what is happening in his industry, and in areas that could be of interest.
The strategy may already have reaped some benefits: Under Nadella’s leadership, Microsoft has scored some of its biggest acquisitions and investments, among them, its 2016 purchase of LinkedIn for $26 billion, as well as its $7.5 billion purchase of GitHub in 2018.

The AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification.
Another notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. The company recently revealed that Azure, the cloud service offered by the tech giant, is the first cloud unit in the world to run the new Blackwell systems made by chip firm NVIDIA. Blackwell is the latest AI-optimized system from NVIDIA that is the most powerful and efficient yet, but has been beset by production delays. However, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang revealed last month that the demand for the new chips remained insane and the firm was expecting billions of dollars in revenue from these chips in the fourth quarter. Per Microsoft, Azure is running Blackwell via the GB200 AI servers.
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

6,2024-10-10 15:15:02+00:00,"PC shipments fall in Q3 despite AI push by Microsoft, chipmakers", Daniel Howley    · Technology Editor,"The global PC industry hit a snag in the third quarter, as worldwide shipments declined for the first time in three quarters — despite hype around so-called artificial intelligence PCs and growth in the US and Japan.
According to Gartner, third quarter PC shipments, or devices sent out to retailers for sale, fell 1.3% year over year to 62.9 million units from 63.8 million units in the same period in 2023. Shipments dropped the most in China, with Gartner reporting a 10% collapse in demand in the country as government and state-affiliated entities sought out fewer desktops.
Shipments in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa took a less dramatic hit than China, dropping 1.5% due to a flurry of events that Gartner says distracted consumers, including elections in the UK and France and sporting events like the Olympics. The US, meanwhile, saw a 5.6% increase in shipments, while Japan saw double-digit growth in the quarter.
Still, the PC industry is in the midst of a broader comeback after years of declines and the massive amount of growth it experienced at the onset of the pandemic. At the time, consumers and enterprises bought up virtually as many PCs as they could get their hands on to ensure they had the means to work and stay entertained while stuck in their homes for months on end.
But that boom meant people who might have been holding off on buying PCs ended up purchasing them sooner than they otherwise would have, pulling future sales forward. With so many customers outfitted with new PCs, demand crumbled, leading to an extended slump that lasted roughly two years, including the worst decline in 17 years in 2023. The slump hit companies ranging from PC manufacturers for Microsoft (MSFT) to chipmakers Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA).
In Q2 2023, as sales struggled, Microsoft reported that its Windows OEM sales, or sales of its Windows operating system to laptop and desktop manufacturers, fell 39% year over year. Intel and AMD saw similar declines, with Intel reporting that its first quarter 2023 Client Computing Group revenue, the organization responsible for PC chip sales, dropped an incredible 38% compared to Q1 2022. AMD reported a 65% year-over-year drop in net revenue in its Client group in 2023 from $2.1 billion to $739 million.
The shipment declines come as the PC industry is pushing the concept of AI PCs, or computers outfitted with neural processing units (NPUs) or high-powered graphics cards that can run AI applications locally rather than via the cloud.
Microsoft is pushing its own version of AI PCs it refers to as Copilot+ PCs, which meet certain hardware requirements such as powerful NPUs. But the marketing doesn’t seem to be paying off.
According to Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa, AI PCs “did not boost the demand for PCs since buyers have yet to see their clear benefits or business value.”
What’s more, she said, the end of Windows 10 support in 2025 didn’t drive updates in areas like China.
There’s still plenty of debate about whether AI will become a huge selling point for consumer electronics, whether that’s PCs or smartphones. So far, Microsoft has shown off a number of potentially useful AI features for Windows 11, including its Click to Do option that provides you with a context-sensitive set of options to take action on what you’re viewing on your screen.
Microsoft says you can do things like remove or blur the background in a photo or perform a visual search using Bing, allowing the search engine to search for content based on images rather than words.
But it’s not clear yet if AI is a major selling point for consumers. Jefferies recently downgraded Apple’s stock saying that expectations for AI-powered iPhones are overblown. And if that holds true, you can bet it’ll be the same for PCs.
Regardless of the declines in Q3 or whether AI proves to be the kind of catalyst the industry needs, Kitagawa says PC shipments should improve for the year as a whole and blow up in 2025.
“At the worldwide level, PC demand will see more uptake toward the end of 2024 and more robust growth in 2025, when the PC refresh will be at its peak,” said Kitagawa.

8,2024-10-12 16:34:44+00:00,Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) the Best Safe Stock To Invest In For The Long Term in 2024?,  Maleha Afzal ,"We recently compiled a list of 10 Safe Stocks To Invest In For The Long Term in 2024. In this article, we will look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks among 10 Safe Stocks To Invest In For The Long Term in 2024.
The recent market action can be attributed to the Fed’s decision. To discuss the future of the equity market, Drew Pettit, Citi US equity strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance on September 26, 2024.
According to Pettit, the market is yet to hit an all-time high if you look beneath the surface. He suggests that the Fed’s decision and if the potential softness in the labor data comes through, investors may regain confidence positioning the market for recovery. He adds that in the past quarter, cyclical and secular stocks have been performing well, but are yet to hit the market peak.
Speaking of growth sectors, some sectors have outperformed others, growing exponentially. Pettit adds that stocks with mature business models have yielded greater returns from minuscule upsides in sales. As for the tech sector, he believes that stocks will remain resilient and will be able to handle some deceleration. He advises investors to remain cautious of tech stocks moving forward and focus on overlooked areas of the market such as consumer goods, financials, and cyclicals.
The market saw a great run-up after the easing cycle. However, the question of a soft landing still stands. On September 30, Liz Young Thomas, SoFi head of investment strategy, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss the latest market trends and opportunities for investors.
Thomas believes that the maximum gains have already been achieved up until the easing cycle, however, growth may continue till the end of 2024. She stresses that the next 30 to 60 days are extremely crucial for the market and will help investors understand the motive behind the rate cuts, and whether the cuts were needed in the first place.
While growth in the tech sector has been slowing down, other sectors have reportedly grown and more than 80% of the S&P 500 has been trading above the 200-day moving average. She adds that the tech sector has started to strengthen and the optimism surrounding the Chinese economy may combine to yield positive results for the market.
Thomas reiterates that while multiples are rich, to ensure a soft landing, the market must move to trade based on fundamentals rather than on multiples. She explains that this simply means that multiples are unlikely to expand from here, but earnings may get more steady. Sectors such as industrials have been growing and expanding while financials have been slower. Thomas advises investors to focus on stocks that have strong fundamentals and steady earnings growth.
Our Methodology
To come up with the safest stocks to invest in for the long term in 2024 we consulted multiple reports and also screened for reliable growers using the Finviz stock screener. We compiled an initial list of 30 stocks. We then referred to the 10% year revenue growth rate for each of the stocks along with their history of dividend payouts. Companies with the highest growth rates and a history of dividend growth were included in the list. The 10 safe stocks to invest in for the long term in 2024 are in ascending order of their 10-year revenue growth rate.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
10 Year Revenue Growth: 10.94%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world that develops productivity and business suite applications, cloud products, and personal computing products.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported revenue worth $64.7 billion in FQ4 2024, up by 15% year-over-year. During the same quarter, Microsoft Cloud had $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 21%. Its productivity/business processes and intelligent cloud segment, on the other hand, logged revenue worth $20.3 billion and $28.5 billion respectively.
The company is a leading investor in artificial intelligence technology. In July, Microsoft and Lumen Technologies partnered to enhance and modernize Lumen’s workloads to Microsoft Azure. Earlier in August, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnered with Palantir Technologies, a data software company, to deploy its suite of products in Microsoft Azure. Only last week, the company partnered with Rezolve AI to change the online retail landscape with AI-backed solutions.
The company’s partnerships do not end here. BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft, and MGX recently made a $100 billion deal to enhance the functioning of data centers and AI. The company is also expanding its footprint by establishing engineering development centers in Abu Dhabi, UAE. In addition to that, Microsoft invested a staggering EUR 4.3 billion to boost AI infrastructure and cloud usage in Italy.
Overall, Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) financial strength coupled with its strategic partnerships in various industries make it one of the safest stocks to invest in for the long term. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and their stakes amounted to $89.07 billion. As of June 30, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the most dominant shareholder in the company and has a position worth $15.6 billion, according to the Insider Monkey database.
Fred Alger Management’s Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft’s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure’s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.”
Overall MSFT ranks 3rd on our list of safe stocks to invest in for the long term in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of  MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

9,2024-10-06 14:13:48+00:00,Microsoft wants to change the way you use your PC. It needs to succeed., Daniel Howley    · Technology Editor,"Microsoft (MSFT) wants you to talk to your computer. No, not by swearing at it when your boss schedules another 8 a.m. meeting. Rather, the tech giant wants you to have actual back-and-forth conversations with your laptop.
Dubbed Copilot Voice and available as part of Microsoft’s latest Copilot AI platform update, the software feature is designed to let you speak directly to your PC and for it to talk back to you.
“We think that Copilot Voice is going to be really a big unlock in terms of how you interface with technology,” Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi told Yahoo Finance.
“We now have the most advanced AI models that are really fast. So this is not like the old ‘Hey Siri’ or ‘Hello, Alexa,’” Mehdi said, explaining that Copilot’s AI offers more impressive voice recognition capabilities.
In addition to voice, Microsoft is working on a feature called Copilot Vision that will allow Copilot to see what you’re doing on your screen and answer questions and make suggestions based on the content you’re viewing. Copilot Vision is only available to select Copilot Pro subscribers for the moment, but Microsoft plans to roll it out to all users in the future.
Taken together, Copilot Voice and Copilot Vision hold the promise of a major shift in how we use our PCs and a means for Microsoft to potentially boost PC sales as it continues to ramp up its consumer AI push via its Copilot+PC effort.
But the company is facing ever-growing competition from longtime rivals Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL), which already offer or are preparing to debut their own AI features. And if Copilot doesn’t catch on among consumers, it could leave an enormous blemish on Microsoft’s efforts to be the go-to AI company.
Being able to chat with an AI assistant isn’t exactly a wildly new feature. Apple and Google already offer AI helpers that you can speak to, as does Amazon. And with their latest upgrades, Apple's and Google’s offerings should provide the kind of natural-sounding responses that Microsoft’s Copilot does.
But it’s Copilot’s ability to see what you’re doing on your screen and then talk about that content with you that’s truly intriguing. Copilot Vision is designed to work with Microsoft’s Edge browser and allow you to have discussions with your computer about what new shows to watch when you’re bored.
In a demo Microsoft showed off, Copilot and an off-screen user talked about the available shows and movies on the website Rotten Tomatoes and which ones the user might enjoy. The conversation seemed natural enough, though how well the feature works in the real world versus a quick demo remains to be seen.
Still, it’s easy to see how Copilot Voice and Copilot Vision could change how you use your PC. Imagine dropping a few numbers into a spreadsheet and telling Copilot to put them into an attractive chart or playing an Xbox game and asking Copilot how to get past a particularly difficult boss. That’s the direction Microsoft is heading with these technologies.
And while talking to your computer should prove useful, the company says it has no plans to get rid of the classic keyboard and mouse. Rather, Microsoft says the new features will complement the trusted input devices.
Microsoft isn’t just giving Copilot a voice and vision, though. According to Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, the company wants to give its AI the ability to take actions on your behalf.
“It might proactively reach out to you with a reminder or a word of encouragement on your big day. It might help schedule something for you. It might proactively buy something,” Suleyman explained during a press event announcing Copilot Vision on Tuesday.
“Fundamentally, all of these interfaces are about to be represented by different kinds of conversational AI. And so that's the big paradigm shift we're making,” Suleyman added.
But as interesting as Microsoft’s AI features are, they’re largely meant for the PC. Yes, Microsoft offers a Copilot app for smartphone users, but Android and Apple’s iPhone have their own native AI helpers. And chances are users will stick with those rather than download the Copilot app.
That puts Microsoft at a significant disadvantage in the AI wars. That’s because consumers use their smartphones far more than they use their laptops or desktops. Heck, chances are you’re reading this very article on your smartphone.
That means users will spend more time interacting with Apple's and Google’s offerings than Microsoft’s Copilot. Microsoft will undoubtedly benefit from the fact that its Copilot software is also built into its enterprise offerings, but on the consumer side, it will face an uphill battle when it comes to taking on Google’s Gemini and Apple’s Apple Intelligence.
Google is also aiming to roll out its own AI vision software called Project Astra that will allow users' smartphones to see and understand the world around them. Apple is also working on a similar feature. But Apple’s AI platform is still in its early stages, with the company set to roll out more features in the coming months and across 2025.
Microsoft also has the benefit of its relationship with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which will help boost the Windows maker’s portfolio of AI offerings. But the company will need to ensure its AI efforts take off among consumers before Google or Apple steal the spotlight.
If it can’t do that and it doesn’t deliver on its promises of making your laptop speak, its AI services could end up in danger of going the way of another famous Microsoft helper: the long-gone Clippy assistant for Microsoft Office.

10,2024-10-09 11:10:09+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): A Promising AI Stock According to Analysts,  Maleha Afzal ,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other promising AI stocks.
While 2024 has been a solid year for defensive stocks and utilities, the technology sector, on the other hand, experienced significant headwinds. However, the general outlook for technology and AI is starting to improve as we near the end of 2024. On October 9, Dominic Rizzo, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his thesis for the AI industry.
Most investors were disappointed after they failed to generate higher returns for their investments in AI during the second quarter of 2024. While Rizzo expects the theme to prevail for the next few quarters, he suggests that the technology and AI sector is on track to earn better returns, especially companies using artificial intelligence to improve their businesses.
As for the Magnificent Seven, while all companies have distinct business models and offerings, these companies have grown at a 50% to 100% faster rate than the rest of the market, making it reasonable to group them. Overall, Rizzo reiterates that while the group has been under immense pressure, it is well-positioned to leverage AI to its benefit.
Rizzo believes that AI is an innovation that is here to stay rather than a mere disruptive technology, meaning that companies using it to their benefit will most likely perform better than the ones that are not. Therefore, most if not companies have no other option but to direct investments in AI chips and GPUs. He expects the AI chip market to reach $400 billion by 2027.
Technology has been altering the world since humans came into being. On October 8, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan CEO appeared in an interview on Bloomberg Television where he discussed the role of artificial intelligence, initial public offerings, and the easing cycle by the Fed.
According to Dimon, technology was previously limited to certain regions and countries, but now we have tech centers in almost every part of the world including Berlin, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. According to Dimon, the acceleration in technology is great and he is glad that innovation is taking precedence, especially in Europe.
Speaking of AI, Dimon suggests that artificial intelligence is going to change a lot of things that are common elements of our world. As far as job losses go, technology has always been changing the job market and is mostly responsible for taking away jobs. However, he emphasizes the need to look at the bigger picture.
Overall, Dimon suggests that jobs will likely be more enhanced and researched-oriented. As for sectors like finance, people have been using it to detect fraud and minimize risk already. Similarly, AI has limited a lot of marketing jobs but at the same time, it has left a positive impact on productivity. Dimon shares he is not worried about AI changing the job landscape and that we should focus on re-training and re-educating workers losing their jobs as new technologies keep springing.
Now that we have studied the outlook of the AI industry, let's take a look at the most promising AI stocks to buy according to analysts.
Our Methodology
To come up with the most promising AI stocks according to analysts, we sifted through multiple ETFs, our own rankings, and similar rankings on the internet. We then ranked the most promising AI stocks based on the Analyst upside as of October 9, 2024. We also included the hedge fund sentiment for each stock. It is to be noted, that we only considered stocks with a market capitalization of over $1 billion, as of October 9, 2024.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Analyst Upside as of October 9, 2024: 21%
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world that develops productivity and business suite applications, cloud products, and personal computing products.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported revenue worth $64.7 billion in FQ4 2024, up by 15% year-over-year. During the same quarter, Microsoft Cloud had $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 21% year-over-year, and posted record bookings. The company is a leading investor in artificial intelligence technology. Its AI-backed cloud service, Azure OpenAI service witnessed an increase in customer base by 60%, reaching 60,000 clients in the second quarter of 2024.
Previously in July, Microsoft and Lumen Technologies signed a partnership to enhance and modernize Lumen’s workloads to Microsoft Azure. Earlier in August, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnered with Palantir Technologies, a data software company, to deploy Palantir’s suite of products in Microsoft Azure. In the past few weeks, the company initiated investments in other countries, signed new partnerships, and nurtured existing strategic partnerships. On October 8, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that Microsoft Azure is the first cloud to be running on NVIDIA’s Blackwell system backed by AI systems, further strengthening its position in AI.
Overall, Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) outlook toward AI coupled with its strong cloud ecosystem makes it one of the most promising AI stocks according to analysts. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and their stakes amounted to $89.068 billion.
Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
""Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.""
Overall MSFT ranks 10th on our list of the most promising AI stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

11,2024-10-01 14:00:33+00:00,Microsoft unveils AI updates for Windows PCs, Daniel Howley    · Technology Editor,"Microsoft (MSFT) is bringing major updates to its Copilot artificial intelligence platform for Windows, expanding the software's capabilities with a number of new features, and introducing the ability to speak directly to the AI helper.
The announcements, which the company made at a press event at its Microsoft Experience Center in New York on Tuesday, also include a context-aware Click to Do option that provides you with tools and actions to complete tasks related to what you see on your screen, a refreshed version of Windows Search, the ability to upscale your old photos to up to 8K resolution, and an AI-powered edit tool for erasing or adding objects to your images.
The company also said it's working on a feature called Copilot Vision, which is able to view your Edge browser screen and understand questions you ask about what you're looking at.
All of these options come as Microsoft continues its AI push on both the consumer and enterprise sides of its business. The company launched its first wave of Copilot+ PCs in May, including its own Surface line of laptops and devices from partner companies including Dell, HP, and Lenovo.
Shares of Microsoft were off more than 1% on the day, in line with Tuesday's broader market trend.
In addition to its announcements on Tuesday, Microsoft also said it's preparing to roll out its previously delayed Recall feature for Windows 11. Recall is designed to capture screenshots of what you're doing on your computer, providing you with a kind of continuously updated visual library of the apps you've used and websites you've visited.
Security researchers, however, objected to the app saying hackers could exploit it to steal user information. Microsoft has since updated the offering, saying it's improved its overall security and made it an opt-in service.
The new Click to Do feature provides you with a context-aware set of options to complete tasks for what you're looking at on your screen. Press the Windows key, and then click the mouse, and you'll get a pop-up toolbox that will let you do things like remove or blur the background in a photo or perform a visual search using Bing. Microsoft says the feature will also work with text, helping you to rewrite or summarize what you've written.
The improved Windows Search feature now allows you to search for files and photos using descriptions of what they may include rather than their actual names. So, if you're looking for a file about an article you've written about new Microsoft features, you can search using something like ""new Microsoft updates"" and Search should pull up the right file.
Microsoft's improved photo editing and image upscaling will help you take out unwanted objects from your photos, while Super resolution in Photos will improve the look of your older images, so you can grab those old shots you took on your first-generation iPhone and make them look like you shot them on the latest iPhone 16.
Then there's Copilot Vision, which Microsoft says will only be available to a select set of Pro subscribers through Copilot Labs for now. During a pre-recorded demo, Microsoft showed how a user could speak to Copilot about shows they might want to watch while browsing the Rotten Tomatoes web page. The AI is able to look at the screen and make suggestions about what it sees, explaining to the user why they might enjoy certain TV shows or movies.
Microsoft says nothing is saved from your conversations with Copilot Vision after you end the session and the company won't train its AI using your chats.
All of these updates come ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season. Adding new AI features just as PC sales are beginning to take off again should help drive consumers to Microsoft Copilot+ PCs. But Apple's (AAPL) own Apple Intelligence is also set to land on its Mac line of computers in the coming months, setting up an AI showdown for both company's laptop and desktop businesses.

12,2024-09-29 12:00:16+00:00,The cold war between Google and Microsoft has 'gone hot', Alexis Keenan    · Senior Legal Reporter,"A long-standing feud between Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) is spilling into public view once again.
The latest shot from Google came in a complaint filed with the European Commission Wednesday, accusing Microsoft of violating the European Union’s antitrust law.
Google said in a document provided to Yahoo Finance that Microsoft illegally leveraged its dominant enterprise server software “Windows Server” licenses to force customers to stick with Microsoft for cloud computing.
Microsoft predicted Google would ""fail"" in this instance, saying it had already settled similar concerns raised by European cloud providers.
""Having failed to persuade European companies, we expect Google similarly will fail to persuade the European Commission,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.
The new dispute demonstrates ""this is a cold war that's gone hot,"" Adam Kovacevich, CEO and Founder of the tech policy advocacy group Chamber of Progress, told Yahoo Finance.
The two tech giants have spent the last two decades battling for supremacy in technologies ranging from online search and cloud computing to the markets for operating systems, gaming software, online advertising — and now artificial intelligence, or AI.
The feud began in the first decade after Microsoft settled a landmark antitrust case brought by the US Justice Department alleging it boxed out rivals by making its browser free and the default on its dominant Windows operating system.
A 2002 settlement opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market and created an opportunity for Google, then a startup formed by Stanford students Sergey Brin and Larry Page, to begin its period of meteoric growth in the 2000s.
Microsoft defended its reestablished territory in a series of videos first released in 2011, in which Microsoft skewered Google with parodies suggesting that Google’s competing Gmail service, Chrome browser, and accompanying software lacked quality and privacy.
A video titled “Gmail Man” questioned Google's ethics by accusing it of mining every word within its Gmail customers' private emails in order to target them with advertisements.
In other videos titled ""Scroogled"" and ""Googlighting"" — a spoof on the 1980s hit television series ""Moonlighting"" — Microsoft questioned whether consumers should trust Google with handling their private information.
In 2016, the companies entered into a ceasefire with an agreement to end regulatory complaints against each other globally as two new CEOs — Google's Sundar Pichai and Microsoft's Satya Nadella — took over.
The pact came to an end in 2021 as regulators in the US and EU stepped up pressure on both companies, and Microsoft complained that Google used unfair tactics to compete in online search and advertising.
Things really got uncomfortable last year during a high-profile antitrust trial that pitted Google against the US Justice Department — a case that alleged Google illegally monopolized the online search engine market and had echoes of the case the DOJ filed against Microsoft in the 1990s.
The most prominent witness to testify against Google was Nadella, who did not hesitate to take a shot at his rival while on the stand.
“You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth, and you search on Google,” Nadella said, emphasizing Google’s overwhelming dominance in the search engine market.
Nadella said Microsoft’s own search engine, Bing, failed to gain traction because Google had negotiated for Google Search to get default placement on browsers, desktops, and mobile devices like Apple's iPhones and iPads and Android-based smartphones made by Samsung and others.
Nadella went on to describe the imbalance as a “vicious cycle” that he worried would intensify with the development of AI.
Google lost the case in a judge’s ruling that labeled its search business an illegal monopoly. The resolution is now pending a remedies phase that could result in a breakup of Google’s empire.
Microsoft certainly had a lot to gain from a Google defeat, Kovacevich said.
“They were probably the main instigator of the US Justice Department's antitrust suit over Google,” Kovacevich said. “And the guilty verdict against Google probably stands to benefit Microsoft's Bing most of anyone.”
Microsoft is taking a similar approach in yet another antitrust lawsuit against Google that is still in its initial trial phase. It argues there that Google’s control of online advertising technologies has harmed the success of its Bing browser.
It's unknown if the EU will take up Google's most recent attack against Microsoft's cloud computing rules.
Google is arguing that Microsoft imposed a 400% markup on customers to migrate their Windows Server licenses to a competing cloud service, while customers who chose Microsoft's cloud services, Azure, could migrate for “essentially nothing.”
In making its case, Google is using the same sort of ""bundling"" or ""tying"" claims used in the 1998 case against Microsoft brought by the DOJ.
Back then, US prosecutors alleged that Microsoft illegally monopolized the market for personal computing operating systems by using its Windows operating system to give away its browser, Internet Explorer, for free.
The move bundled the browser along with Windows, eventually putting rival browser Netscape Navigator out of business.
Microsoft was eventually required to open up Windows to third party software, which paved the way for companies including Google to ""interoperate"" or run their browser and search software using Microsoft-powered computers.
Now, in the market for cloud computing, Google is arguing that Microsoft leveraged ""dominance in one market to prevent competition on the merits in a separate, unrelated market,"" according to the document shared with Yahoo Finance.

13,2024-10-02 15:16:50+00:00,Microsoft exec reassures staff there’s no plan for Amazon-style RTO,  Christiaan Hetzner ,"Microsoft won't impose a new return-to-office mandate unless management concludes that productivity has dropped, a high-level exec has reportedly told workers.
The software and cloud-computing giant currently allows employees to work remotely, with many new hires promised the flexibility of working from home at least half the week. But that isn’t written in stone.
According to two anonymous sources that spoke with Business Insider, executive vice president Scott Guthrie recently told staff at his Microsoft’s Cloud and AI group, which includes Azure, that a policy change isn’t on the cards at present—so long as workers stay productive.
Fortune has reached out to Microsoft requesting comment on what specific metric for productivity is used, how that would be benchmarked, and whether the process would be made transparent for employees.
While no statement has been provided as of press time, Microsoft told Business Insider that the company's work policies have not changed.
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s bombshell decree has roiled tech employees across the sector, many of whom dread a return to hours wasted in traffic jams on the long daily commute.
That’s assuming a suitable branch office is even within driving distance for those who joined with the understanding they would work remotely on a permanent basis.
As a result a number of staff are now “rage applying” for a new job, with some experts predicting Jassy and other execs like him will eventually be forced to backpedal amid widespread worker revolts.
Experts have suggested RTO mandates may in fact be an excuse to elegantly trim staff numbers without restorting to severance by simply motivating employees to quit. According to a recent survey by anonymous job review site Blind, some 73% of verified Amazon professionals said they’re considering quitting.
The RTO issue is contentious, and Jassy is by no means the most draconian CEO when it comes to the issue.
Elon Musk may very well be the most outspoken executive opposed to remote and hybrid work, having already ended the practice in June 2022 at Tesla. He suggested white-collar employees who want the continued flexibility remote and hybrid work offers were in fact simply lazy. “They should pretend to work somewhere else,” he said in defense of his approach.
The entrepreneur, however, is only demanding the same attendance for his knowledge workers as his shop-floor workers, whom he required to show up in the middle of the pandemic’s first wave. He branded what he called the “laptop class” as out-of-touch elites that give off “real Marie Antoinette vibes” compared with the work ethic of their blue-collar brethren manning assembly lines.
Musk may have had a point when it came to growing resentment over differing treatments within the workforce.
U.S. dockworkers along the Eastern Seaboard and on the Gulf Coast are now going on strike for the first time since 1977, in a move that could cost the U.S. economy up to $4.5 billion every day. Striking port employees are demanding fair compensation from port operators for their efforts over the past six years including the pandemic.
“When [ports] made their most money was during COVID, when my men had to go to work on those piers every single day when everybody stayed home to go to work. Not my men; they died out there with the virus,” said president Harold Daggett of the ILA trade union. “Nobody stayed home. Well, I want to be compensated for that.”

14,2024-07-31 09:06:32+00:00,Microsoft stock drops after results fall short in latest AI disappointment, Daniel Howley    · Technology Editor,"Microsoft (MSFT) released its fiscal fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, beating on the top and bottom lines, but missing on cloud revenue expectations.
For the quarter, Microsoft reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.95 on revenue of $64.7 billion. Wall Street was anticipating EPS of $2.94 on revenue of $64.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft reported EPS of $2.69 and revenue of $56.2 billion during the same period last year.
Microsoft's overall cloud revenue came in at $36.8 billion, in line with expectations of $36.8 billion, but the company's Intelligent Cloud revenue, which includes its Azure services, fell short, coming in at $28.5 billion versus expectations of $28.7 billion.
Shares of Microsoft were about 2% lower in pre-market trading on Wednesday, having fallen over 7% earlier in the wake of the results.
While Microsoft's cloud business missed expectations, overall revenue still rose 21% year over year. Intelligent Cloud revenue, meanwhile, increased 19% year over year. What's more, Microsoft said AI services contributed 8 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue, which increased by 29%.
Microsoft's AI miss sent shares of fellow AI-heavy companies like Meta lower in after-hours trading. The social media giant was off more than 3% on the news.
The report follows rival and Google parent Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) earnings announcement last week, during which the company said it is seeing an uptick in cloud revenue partially due to interest in AI products.
Still, Google didn’t offer specific numbers on the impact of AI on the cloud business, leaving some analysts like UBS’s Stephen Ju to predict that revenue benefits from the company’s AI spending might not come until the first half of 2025 at the earliest.
According to UBS analyst Karl Keirstead, Microsoft has also been grabbing more market share from Google and Amazon.
“In terms of share shifts among AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, the most consistent theme in this round of checks was the number of customers and partners that cited share gains by Microsoft resulting from its early lead on the AI front,” Keirstead wrote in a recent note about the three major cloud players.
“This has been a recurring theme from checks over the last 6-12 months and the commentary about Azure’s relative strength felt consistent with prior checks,” he added.
During Alphabet’s earnings call, CFO Ruth Porat said the company spent $13 billion on capital expenditures, up from $12 billion in the prior quarter, adding that the vast majority of that spending is going toward AI.
Amazon (AMZN) is set to report earnings on Aug. 1.
Shares of Google are up 22% year to date, while shares of Amazon are up 23%.

15,2024-10-13 19:55:55+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Hedge Funds Are Bullish On This Profitable Blue Chip Stock Right Now,  Affan Mir ,"We recently compiled a list of the 8 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other profitable blue chip stocks.
The September inflation report came in hotter than expected and showed that it remains sticky. Headline inflation rose by 2.4%, slightly above the anticipated 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. Month-over-month, CPI increased by 0.2%, exceeding the forecast of 0.1%.
Core inflation, excluding food and energy, also came in higher than expected at 3.3%, compared to the anticipated 3.2%, marking a slight increase from August. On a monthly basis, core CPI rose by 0.3%, which matched August’s figures but was above expectations of 0.2%.
Following the report, the market is expecting a 25 basis points rate cut to no rate cuts in the upcoming Fed meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 79.9% of interest rate traders expect the rate cuts to be at 450-475 bps at the coming Fed meeting while 20.1% expect the rate cut to stay the same. At the beginning of the month, 32.1% expected a 50 bps rate cut, while 67.9% anticipated a 25 bps cut.
Despite the sticky inflation, IBM's vice chair, Gary Cohn believes that the Fed will cut rates by 100 bps this year. In an interview at CNBC's ‘Money Movers', he suggested that the U.S. is experiencing what a soft landing looks like, with inflation decreasing but not steadily. He indicated that reaching the Fed's 2% target will be challenging, as inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around this level.
Cohn noted that for the first time in nearly two decades, the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate, employment, and price stability, after focusing primarily on one at a time. He believes the Fed is making the right decisions and is currently in a delicate position as it missed meeting opportunities this year.
Cohn expects that the Fed will implement a total of 100 basis points in rate cuts this year, likely consisting of 25 basis point reductions over the next couple of months. When asked about inflation targets, he expressed a preference for slightly exceeding the target inflation rate, suggesting that a rate of around 2.2% would be more acceptable in a growing economy than undershooting the target.
Cohn also highlighted concerns about geopolitical risks and said that global tensions could lead to inflationary pressures by disrupting supply chains and increasing shipping costs.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the pioneers of personal computing and is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. It aims to make digital technology and AI accessible to everyone worldwide.
It offers a wide range of products and services, including cloud solutions, software applications, and hardware devices. Its research and development focus on improving productivity and business processes, building smart cloud and edge platforms, and creating more personalized computing experiences.
Moreover, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also maintains data centers to expand capacity for growing AI service demands. Most products are manufactured by third-party contractors, which offers flexibility, though some components rely on a limited number of suppliers, which could disrupt production. Its internal research and development spans several groups, including Cloud and AI, Security, and Gaming, allowing the company to maintain competitive advantages.
Over the last few quarters, the company has taken over a huge part of the AI market and its products are being widely used by other companies. Its tools like Copilots and the Azure OpenAI Service have gained widespread adoption, with 60% of Fortune 500 companies implementing Copilots and 65% using Azure OpenAI Service.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also one of the best AI datacenter stocks. In 2023, the company increased its AI data center spending by 50%, surpassing Amazon's 3% decrease. The company partnered with BlackRock to create a $100 billion fund for AI data center growth and pledged over $4 billion for AI infrastructure in Italy. Reports show that Microsoft is set to double its data center capacity to 5 gigawatts this year. It is one of the most profitable blue chip stocks to invest in.
Generation Investment Management stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Generative AI’s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI’s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called ‘inference’). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category – nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google’s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years.
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the most profitable blue chip stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

16,2024-09-27 17:00:56+00:00,Microsoft to launch delayed Recall feature following security controversy, Daniel Howley    · Technology Editor,"Microsoft (MSFT) is set to finally release its long-delayed Recall feature for Windows 11. The software option, which the company debuted back in May, saves screenshots of virtually everything you do on your computer allowing you to search for and interact with them later on.
For instance, if you were booking a hotel room but forgot the website you were using or need to find an old document and can’t remember what you named it, you can use Recall to describe the site or document and it will find them for you by searching through those screenshots.
It’s a helpful concept, but security researchers quickly raised concerns about the potential for hackers or malware software to gain access to those screenshots, steal users' data, and view some of their most sensitive information.
In response, Microsoft put the feature on hold and instead chose to launch its Copilot+ PCs without Recall. Now, after reworking the software, Microsoft says it’s ready to go and that users’ data will be as secure as it could possibly be. Microsoft has yet to reveal the official launch date however.
“I think this is really a statement from Microsoft saying we're going to put our full power into making AI secure,” David Weston, Microsoft vice president of Enterprise and OS Security, told Yahoo Finance.
One of the biggest changes to Recall is that it is now opt-in, meaning if you want to use it, you’ll need to select a specific box that says as much. Recall was previously enabled by default.
Microsoft also says that users' screenshots, or Snapshots, as the company calls them, are encrypted and that the only way to access them is using Microsoft’s Windows Hello, which requires you to authenticate that you are who you say you are using your laptop’s fingerprint reader or facial recognition capabilities.
If a user’s laptop is infected with malware, Microsoft says it uses rate-limiting and anti-hammering to prevent the malicious software from accessing your information. Rate-limiting and anti-hammering detect when someone or something is trying to log into a program too many times in a short amount of time and require them to reauthenticate via their fingerprint or face ID.

Microsoft also says that Recall is now using the company’s Purview software, which helps protect enterprise systems, to ensure the platform doesn’t save things like users’ passwords, national ID numbers, or credit card numbers. According to Weston, Purview contains a database that allows it to recognize what those types of numbers might look like and prevents Recall from capturing images of them.
What’s more, Microsoft says users will be able to choose what kind of screenshots Recall can take. You can, for instance, tell Recall not to capture Snapshots of specific apps or web browsers or certain types of documents. You can also fully disable or uninstall Recall if you don’t want it on your computer at all.
Additionally, the software will recognize when you’re using private browsing or incognito mode with your web browser and stop capturing images of what you’re looking at.
To prove its security chops, Microsoft says it conducted months of security reviews using its Microsoft Offensive Research and Security Engineering team and third-party security experts to ensure the software is safe.
Recall is one of the marquee features of Microsoft’s Copilot+ PCs, which is a designation for laptops that meet a specific threshold of power and capabilities and are running the latest version of Windows 11. Launching the software without Recall, however, meant that while users still had access to the Copilot assistant software, they weren’t able to access one of the capabilities that Microsoft hoped would be a major selling point for its AI push.
Now Microsoft just has to ensure the software is as secure as it says.

17,2024-09-18 22:02:13+00:00,"I loved my job at Microsoft, but I had to resign on principle. Here’s why",  Holly Alpine ,"In Microsoft’s own words on climate change, “those of us who can afford to move faster and go further should do so.” So why is Microsoft going backwards?
No matter how we vote, what generation we belong to, or what part of the world we live in, many of us have sweltered this summer. During one week in June, the world broke 1,400 temperature records—with 1,300 people dying in the Hajj heatwave alone. That should remind us of our shared reality: Climate issues are among our most urgent challenges worldwide.
I am a Seattle-based, 32-year-old, plant-powered mountain athlete and climate activist who resigned earlier this year from Microsoft, a company hailed by one media outlet as the best ESG company of 2023. Now, I am co-leading a campaign to advocate for effective policy, inform standards, and build a cross-industry coalition to drive change. Before you dismiss me as an idealist tech worker disconnected from our oil-dependent economy, I want you to hear the backstory. 
I painfully quit a job I loved leading multiple global sustainability programs primarily because, after years of organizing internally to make change, I could no longer reconcile Microsoft’s strong public environmental sustainability stance with its assistance to the oil and gas industry—a partnership that was dramatically increasing global emissions. I realized that internal pressure alone wasn’t going to shift the incentives; the public and shareholders needed to know what was happening.
Corporations play a role in many of the greatest challenges of our time, and many have made strong pledges around labor and human rights, conflict minerals, or privacy. Over almost a decade at Microsoft, the challenge I devoted my career to was environmental sustainability. I was in good company, with Microsoft’s laudable sustainability commitments backed by thousands of world-class employees and programs. 
Microsoft is extremely outspoken on the ethics of technology and sustainability. President Brad Smith has ardently emphasized the need to control whether technology is used ""for good or ill,"" and has made strong statements on Microsoft’s role in climate change. Similarly, CEO Satya Nadella has stated to shareholders, ""As we pursue our mission, we also recognize our enormous responsibility to ensure the technology we build benefits everyone on the planet, including the planet itself."" 
I’m proud that the employee group I cofounded played a part in strengthening Microsoft’s environmental pledges. But even as the tech giant promulgates the urgency to act on climate for “a shared future,” its core business activities directly contribute to the climate crisis.
As outlined in an explosive new article in the Atlantic, in truth, Microsoft's advanced technology is enabling a substantial increase in global emissions. The company dominates as the largest cloud provider of advanced technology (e.g. AI) to the fossil fuel industry, surpassing all other vendors combined. Its digital technology is contributing to staggering fossil fuel industry profits, with companies like Chevron last year producing “more oil and natural gas than any year in the company’s history.""
Between 2018-19, Microsoft publicized explicit goals—including “expand production” with Exxon, “generate new exploration opportunities” with Chevron, and accelerate “extracted and refined” hydrocarbons with BP. In one Microsoft customer case study, Staale Gjervik, president of ExxonMobil subsidiary XTO Energy, revealed, “Over the coming decade, we plan to drill thousands of new wells and build dozens of new facilities. It’s challenging to keep up with that pace, but with [Microsoft] Azure, we have the digital technology to help support our growth…”
In 2020, following Microsoft's major carbon announcements and scrutiny from Greenpeace's ""Oil in the Cloud"" report, the company shifted the tone of its public communications, largely omitting such references from its public-facing materials. However, inside the company, the focus on increasing extraction flourished. Over the past four years, fossil fuel companies became among the top consumers of Microsoft's cloud and AI services—and now, generative AI has supercharged the problem.
Analyst reports suggest that advanced technologies—such as AI or machine learning (ML)—have the potential to increase fossil fuel yield by 15%, contributing to a resurgence of oil and potentially delaying the global transition to renewable energy. The real-world impacts are staggering: A single such deal between Microsoft and ExxonMobil could generate emissions that exceed Microsoft’s 2020 annual carbon removal commitments by over 600%. I saw dozens of such deals during the time I was employed at Microsoft.
Internally, discussions highlighted the most significant application of generative AI for the oil and gas industry: optimizing exploration activities. AI was celebrated as a ""game changer"" and the key for the fossil fuel industry to continue to be competitive.
Microsoft makes billions of dollars from helping fossil fuel companies accelerate all phases of oil and gas production. This makes their claims of facilitating the transition to a decarbonized economy and establishing AI guardrails toward a “nature-positive future” seem to me to be misleading for shareholders, employees, and customers who trust and invest in Microsoft due to its strong sustainability reputation. While Microsoft’s public statements and reports highlight the beneficial applications of AI for sustainability, they crucially omit the fact that a substantial part of Microsoft’s business is providing technology to fossil fuel companies to increase production.
Even if AI reduces emissions per barrel, its role in boosting overall production leads to a net increase in global emissions. Enhanced efficiency translates into more drilling, which undermines the transition to renewables, as the additional fossil fuels brought to market far outweigh any modest extraction-related emission cuts.
Microsoft’s dual approach—promoting sustainability publicly while aiding fossil fuel expansion privately—creates a misleading narrative that can obscure the true environmental impact of their business practices.
To be clear: While we were at Microsoft, my colleagues and I never advocated for the company to sever its ties with the fossil fuel industry; we understood we were still operating in a world dependent on oil. But we did argue that Microsoft needed to align its AI policies with broader global climate aims. The company needed to work to change the system, not capitulate to it.
Microsoft, and other AI companies, can do this by ensuring they are aligning their work in a way that supports climate policies. They can conduct audits of their impact, disclose the climate risks the application of their technologies pose, and actively shift revenue to renewable energy. Most importantly, doing these things and being transparent about the progress they are making—and the challenges they are facing—will encourage competitors to follow.
Relying on fossil-fuel companies to lead the clean-energy transition is risky, as their interests fundamentally remain tied to high-carbon activities. We can leverage their expertise without supporting their entire business, while public investment and green innovators drive the real shift to sustainable infrastructure.
Microsoft's influence can reshape market dynamics and set an industry precedent, akin to its decisions on facial recognition and Google’s moratorium on custom AI for the oil and gas sector. As stated by Microsoft, “If the world is going to meet net zero goals by 2050, companies need to use their entire ecosystem and all of their positions of influence.” But this will only happen if they are transparent with the public about the progress they are making.
We presented these carefully considered recommendations to top Microsoft leadership, who enthusiastically agreed with us, but failed to follow through with implementation.
Microsoft has the capacity to do better than unfulfilled promises to employees and energy principles—their response to our internal pressure—that fail to address the core issues. Microsoft, and the tech industry at large, must take responsibility for the emissions enabled by their technology and lead the way toward a truly sustainable future for all.

18,2024-09-16 19:26:56+00:00,Microsoft bringing more AI technology to its productivity software as it works to monetize investments, Daniel Howley    · Technology Editor,"Microsoft (MSFT) is pouring more of its AI-powered Copilot technology into its Microsoft 365 productivity products, including Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. The updates, which include the ability to use Copilot to draft PowerPoint presentations and a feature that prioritizes your emails in Outlook, are a part of what the tech giant refers to as its Copilot Wave 2 rollout.
In addition to the improvements to its Microsoft 365 apps, Microsoft also announced a new collaborative tool called Copilot Pages, which lets teams of workers access, edit, and manipulate data on a single page using information pulled from Copilot.
The company also debuted a new agent builder option that lets users easily create Copilot-powered agents, AI assistants designed to automate and executive business processes.
The moves are all a part of Microsoft’s broader efforts to infuse its vast portfolio of business software products with AI capabilities as it seeks to outpace rivals in the space ranging from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Salesforce (CRM) and monetize its enormous investments in AI technology.
Microsoft says the number of customers using Copilot increased more than 60% quarter over quarter and that the number of people who use it daily at work doubled. What’s more, the Windows maker says Vodafone is purchasing 68,000 Copilot licenses for its 100,000 employees after it found that the software helped workers save an average of three hours per week per person.
The new Copilot features for Microsoft’s 365 apps are all designed to help improve worker efficiency, whether that means tracking meeting transcripts and chats to make it easier to catch up or quickly adding references to documents, PDFs, and emails in a Word document.
The Copilot agent builder for Copilot Studio, meanwhile, is designed to help put together an AI-powered agent that fits your company’s needs without needing much technical know-how.
“One of the things which we heard very consistently was ... it's not one size fits all when it comes to Copilot,” Charles Lamanna, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of business and industry Copilot, told Yahoo Finance.
“If you have this company and this company, say, Disney versus Novartis, what they want to do in Microsoft 365 with Copilot is going to be slightly different. They have different data sources, they have different workflows, they have different processes. They have just … different ways of working.”
That’s where Microsoft’s agent builder comes in. Say, for example, you want to make it easier for new employees to better understand their health benefits. You can use Copilot Studio to tell an agent to answer questions about your company’s healthcare offerings and point it to any relevant documents.
When a worker uses the agent, it will automatically pull data from those documents, providing them with the information they need without having to scour multiple microsites and digital pamphlets.
“Everyone in a company will be able to create agents and to use agents,” Lamanna said.
Microsoft’s Copilot software is a major part of its broader push into the generative AI space, which includes investing in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, and is at least part of the reason the company’s stock price is up more than 30% over the last 12 months. Rival and Google parent Alphabet’s stock is up 14% in the same period.
During its most recent earnings report, Microsoft announced that its Intelligent Cloud segment revenue, which includes Azure services, was $28.5 billion. That was just short of Wall Street’s expectation of $28.7 billion. And while that was a 19% year-over-year revenue increase, investors reacted negatively to the news, sending shares lower following the earnings announcement.

As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.

Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.

However, as Azure capacity comes online and AI revenue continues to scale, Microsoft should execute well against Goldman's expectations for 14% revenue growth, the advisory told investors in a research note. The investment firm said Microsoft’s earnings growth is still 300 basis points faster than the S&P 500, which justifies the stock's valuation.
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

20,2024-09-23 14:15:00+00:00,"Bill Gates Says If He Started Microsoft Today, He'd Focus On This Industry Instead",  AJ Fabino ,"Microsoft co-founder and one of the world’s most prominent tech visionaries, Bill Gates, is turning his attention toward a new type of technology.In an interview with CNBC, Gates said that if he were to launch a startup today, he would leave his software roots behind and focus squarely on artificial intelligence (AI).
""Today, somebody could raise billions of dollars for a new AI company [that's just] a few sketch ideas,"" Gates told CNBC, reflecting AI’s fervor. So far this year, startups in the field have attracted more than $26 billion in investments, according to CNBC citing data from PitchBook.

Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.
Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.
If Microsoft’s co-founder were to embark on the venture, Gates said his AI company would aim to compete with tech giants like Nvidia, Google and OpenAI or find an area where AI could deliver unique value.“To really stand out as a small company, you have to pick something you're going to do uniquely,"" Gates told CNBC.
His shift in focus from software to AI mirrors a changing tech landscape. CNBC noted that when Microsoft was founded in 1976, Gates and co-founder Paul Allen were among the few who envisioned a future where computers would be part of everyday life.

""I was lucky that my belief in software made me unique,"" Gates said. ""Just believing in AI, that's not unique. So I would have to develop some unique view of how you design AI systems – something that other people didn't get.""
The billionaire said that entering the AI space at this stage comes with its own set of challenges. With foundational technologies already being developed by well-funded companies, new entrants may struggle to make an impact. Gates told entrepreneurs to focus on how AI could address specific business needs or improve daily life – whether by automating expensive tasks or generating strategic insights with broader applications.
Trending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.
At 68, Gates' priorities have shifted. While he once measured success by Microsoft’s growth, today he is more focused on adding value to the world, particularly through his philanthropic work with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and his clean-energy investment firm, Breakthrough Energy.
He has been encouraging younger minds at Microsoft, OpenAI and other tech companies to push the boundaries of AI, telling them, ""Because you're taking a fresher look at this than I am, and that's your fantastic opportunity.""
Just as his early faith in personal computing was prophetic, Gates' focus on AI may again prove to be a bellwether for the future of technology.

21,2024-09-16 22:05:34+00:00,Microsoft approves new $60 billion share buyback program,Reuters ,"(Reuters) -Microsoft said on Monday its board has approved a new share buy back program of up to $60 billion.
The tech giant declared a quarterly dividend of $0.83 per share, reflecting an 8 cent, or 10%, increase over the previous quarter.
Microsoft said it will hold its annual shareholders meeting on Dec. 10.
In July, the company said it will spend more this fiscal year on AI infrastructure. It reported a 77.6% rise in capital spending in the quarter ended June 30, largely due to AI-related expenses.
The company reported a slowdown in growth at its Azure cloud business in the reported quarter but said growth would accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2025.
Big tech companies, including Microsoft and Alphabet's Google, are facing investor pressure to show a pay off for the billions of dollars they have been investing in AI infrastructure.
Microsoft is one of the few big companies that break out AI contributions in their quarterly earnings, as most firms are yet to see a big boost from AI investments.
Last month, it had restructured how it reports results for its business units, moving some search and news advertising revenue under the Azure cloud-computing unit.
Among other big technology companies, Apple unveiled a record $110 billion share buyback program in May after it reported upbeat quarterly results.
Shares of Microsoft rose marginally in aftermarket trade. Stock has risen about 15% so far this year.

22,2024-10-11 14:29:18+00:00,PPL partners with Microsoft for insurance trading hub,  GlobalData ,"Placing Platform Limited (PPL) has entered into a multi-year agreement with Microsoft to enhance its specialty insurance trading platform.
Under the alliance, PPL will be integrating Microsoft's data and AI capabilities.
This collaboration is aimed at enhancing the way brokers and carriers trade and bind risks, transitioning PPL from a document-centric process to an intuitive trading platform and intelligent data hub.
It will see the creation of a suite of PPL productivity tools using Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Power BI.
These tools are expected to be a catalyst in the shift towards data-driven trading, allowing brokers and carriers to be more responsive.
Enhanced collaboration is a key goal of the initiative, with a PPL market directory curated on Microsoft Teams and managed across Microsoft 365 set to improve contact and response times.
This integration is also set to simplify the capture of trading activity, which is currently completed outside of the platform.
In addition to facilitating better communication, the collaboration promises to provide actionable insights for brokers and carriers through bespoke PPL Copilot prompts.
These prompts will enable users to compare, analyse and gain real-time insights to aid in decision making.
Moreover, an intelligent Microsoft Fabric-powered data hub will house end-to-end trading data, providing PPL clients with access to structured, secure data to support business decisions.
PPL CEO John Mason said: “In collaboration with Microsoft, PPL has the ability to create a step-change in how our clients interact with each other across the end-to-end trading cycle.
“We have engaged some of our key clients early in this process, allowing PPL to test our theories and focus on how we can empower and strengthen digital connectivity between market participants. We have been delighted with their feedback and are now focused on detailed design and delivery.”
Microsoft corporate vice-president of worldwide financial services Bill Borden said: “This latest initiative between PPL and Microsoft is rooted in our shared vision of empowering the insurance industry with innovative tools that boost efficiency and unlock new avenues for growth.”
Last month, insurance broker Howden launched the Howden Resilience Laboratory, a new platform that utilises Microsoft’s technology to assist clients in assessing and managing climate risks.
""PPL partners with Microsoft for insurance trading hub "" was originally created and published by Life Insurance International, a GlobalData owned brand.

23,2024-09-17 14:04:02+00:00,"Microsoft Plans New $60 Billion Buyback, Raises Dividend 10%",  Andrew Pollack ,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. raised its quarterly dividend 10% and unveiled a new $60 billion stock-buyback program, matching the size of a repurchase plan three years ago. The company’s shares gained as much as 2.4%.

The software company said late Monday that shareholders as of Nov. 21 will receive a quarterly dividend of 83 cents a share, compared with the current 75 cents. The share repurchase agreement, which has no expiration date, replaces a buyback program announced in 2021 that was also $60 billion.
While the figures are sizable in absolute terms, the buyback agreement represents less than 2% of Microsoft’s market value. The Redmond, Washington-based company’s shares have gained 31% in the past 12 months, taking its market value to $3.2 trillion as of Monday’s close. Microsoft spreads its share purchases over several years, and they totaled about $17 billion in the fiscal year ending in June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The company’s shares were up 1.7% at 10:02 a.m. New York time at $438.74.
Microsoft’s stock has been pushed to new historical highs in the last several months as investors bet on gains from its push into artificial intelligence. The software maker has infused its product line with technology from its partner OpenAI and has touted the tools’ abilities to augment business applications, such as Teams, Word and Outlook. Microsoft earlier Monday released a new range of AI tools.
Microsoft had $75.5 billion in cash and equivalents as of June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Free cash flow in the fiscal fourth quarter was $23.3 billion, the company said in July, “up 18% year-over-year reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings.”

In this piece, we will look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks among the list of Goldman Sachs' Phase 2 AI stocks.
While consumer technology stocks had soared in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, back then, their share price gains were due to. the growing demand for technology products and services due to lock downs. Now, big technology stocks have persisted in their strong performance despite high interest rates since they have been judged by the market as the top innovators and performers in the artificial intelligence industry.
Since AI is somewhat of a ubiquitous technology, its impact is on several industries. So far, we’ve seen most of the stock market returns related to AI directly tied to just one stock. This stock continued to be the fifth most trending AI stocks as recently as in mid October and its share price returns are nothing short of unbelievable. From its bottom in October 2022 when the split adjusted share price was a mere $11.23, the shares have gained a stunning 1,100%. In other words, if you had invested just $100 back then in the shares and then held onto them for dear life, your investment would be worth $1,200 today.
This is the magic of AI, a technology that has caught Wall Street and retail investors alike by storm. However, AI’s impact, and its enablement, aren’t limited to the GPU designer we’ve mentioned above. While GPUs are the ‘oil’ for this technology, a wide variety of other components from data center infrastructure, networking equipment, connectivity, and energy all will have to play their part if OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s plans of initially building as many as 7 AI data centers across the US, with each data center guzzling an unbelievable 5 Gigawatts of electricity, are to come to fruition.
This then makes us ask, what are such stocks that might enable 35 Gigawatts of AI data centers across the US? After all, in order to meet the world’s demand for AI chips, Altman believes that an unfathomable $7 trillion will need to be spent for building 36 chip manufacturing fabs and additional AI data centers. This money has to be spent somewhere, and therein lies the answer to our question. Things get clearer when we look at a detailed research report from investment bank Goldman Sachs. This report segregated the AI sector into four categories.
The first category only included Wall Street’s AI darling, the second was made of AI capacity providers like server companies, other semiconductor firms, and utilities, the third included firms that sell AI products and software, and the fourth category firms were those that will benefit from AI adoption. In its report, the investment bank shared that year to date in July, the first category had returned 139%. As of mid October, this category has gained 179% on the stock market, so safe to say returns have accelerated despite some turbulence in between. By July, the second group of firms was also doing well. Its returns ranged between ~-8% to ~50%, with the average stock having delivered 22%.
Zooming into these firms, the utility sector is one which had particularly impressed the bank. It shared that utilities were the best performing sector in the flagship S&P index between March and May courtesy of their 16% returns. Their three month returns ranked in the 98th percentile since 2022 and were the third highest after 2003 and 2020 rallies. This outperformance is unsurprising given the strong investments in data centers that have taken the US by storm this year.
These investments have led to estimates suggesting that America’s data center hub, Northern Virginia, will require 11,000 megawatts of electricity by 2035 – demand which has already spurred $5.2 billion in investments for transmission lines and coal fired power plants. Estimates from Boston Consulting Group believe that by 2030, AI will account for 16% of America’s energy consumption and touch 130 gigawatts. For a detailed look at the link between electricity use and data centers, you should read 15 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Jefferies, Citi and Wall Street Analysts.
The bustling optimism surrounding AI is also reflected in revenue estimates. Goldman’s September 2024 research shows that 2025 revenue estimates of semiconductor firms, software enablers, and hardware firms except semiconductors are roughly 2.3x, 2.05x, and 1.8x over 2019 levels, respectively. Similarly, non semiconductor hardware companies have seen their revenue forecasts for Q4 2025 jump to $450 billion for a $380 billion gain over Q1 2024’s $70 billion. Makes us wonder whether it’s this group of companies that might see a stock mirror the 1,100% returns of Wall Street’s AI darling.
Our Methodology

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the global leader in operating systems and one of the biggest players in the cloud and enterprise computing industry. It is also one of the leading players in the AI industry due to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s multi billion dollar investment in AI means that it is entitled to a share of OpenAI’s revenue, and the firm’s Azure cloud computing platform is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new technology. Through Azure, the company enables customers to store, analyze, and run other operations with their data. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s cloud raked in $28.5 billion in FYQ4 revenue, and its AI investments mean that investors are razor focused on its ability to generate AI profits. This is also why Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks at the bottom of our list, as a lack of profits has made its shares lose 2% since its fourth quarter report. Consequently, the ability to drive AI profits is key to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s hypothesis.
Baron Funds mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:
“Microsoft Corporation is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Oice products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Oice 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over- quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year- over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best- positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.”
Overall MSFT ranks 24th on our list of Goldman Sachs' top phase 2 AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

25,2024-10-11 21:23:47+00:00,Unlocking Potential: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Hits Over 500 Million Monthly Active Users in Gaming!,  Ali Ahmed ,"We recently published a list of 7 Best Gaming Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other best gaming stocks to buy now.
The gaming industry does not only provide entertainment but also drives innovation in technology and creativity. The global gaming market was valued at $249.55 billion in 2022. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.1% during 2023-2030 to reach $665.77 billion by ​the end of the forecast period. This expansion is driven by several key trends that are reshaping how games are developed and played.
The growing popularity of cloud gaming, the introduction of VR and AR technologies, and the rising interest in online gaming are some of the key trends driving market growth.
The rising interest in esports and online gaming tournaments is expected to boost consumer spending on games and contribute to market growth. Esports features teams and individual players competing in various video games. In July and August, the first-ever Esports World Cup took place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, attracting over 1,500 players and offering a massive prize pool of $60 million. The event spanned eight weeks and included 23 competitions across 22 different video games, such as Call of Duty and Fortnite. This tournament is part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 initiative, aimed at diversifying the country’s economy.
Another key trend is the integration of generative AI in gaming. This technology allows for the creation of dynamic storylines and realistic characters that can interact with players in a more lifelike manner. Experts believe this will enhance player engagement by personalizing experiences based on individual actions. The potential for AI to craft entire game worlds opens up new avenues for creativity in game design.
According to Bernard Marr, a world-renowned futurist and author of “Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is Changing Business and Society”, generative AI is revolutionizing video game development by providing tools that enable developers to create engaging content, realistic visuals, and immersive gameplay experiences. Marr believes that generative AI can help developers create vast, unique game environments through procedural generation, allowing for dynamic gameplay experiences that change with each session.
Moreover, this technology can generate music and sound effects that adapt to in-game events, enriching the overall player experience. By automating tasks like quest creation and dialogue writing, generative AI can help developers enhance storytelling and design. Marr thinks that although generative AI won’t replace human creativity, it can speed up game development and reduce costs, which is a big step forward for the gaming industry.

26,2024-10-09 20:54:40+00:00,Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) the Best AI Data Center Stock to Buy Now?,  Usman Kabir ,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI data center stocks.
The AI data center industry is experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the massive computational power they require. AI data centers are specialized facilities designed to handle high-intensity AI workloads, including machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network training. These facilities integrate advanced hardware and software to process large-scale data efficiently, creating a crucial infrastructure for the global digital economy. Leading technology companies are making substantial investments in AI data centers. For instance, Meta announced plans to invest $33 billion in data center expansion to support AI research and development. Google is also investing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, committing $3.3 billion in just one region of the United States​. These investments highlight the significance of AI data centers in the broader tech ecosystem.
AI workloads demand hardware that can process vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This need has led to the development of AI-specific chips, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These chips are essential components in AI data centers.

While AI data centers are essential for technological progress, they consume enormous amounts of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide account for about 1% of global electricity demand, a figure that could increase significantly with the rise of AI. Cooling systems, necessary to maintain optimal hardware performance, further contribute to this energy demand. To address this, companies are increasingly focused on building energy-efficient data centers. For example, Google has implemented machine learning algorithms to reduce energy use in its data centers by 30%.
The AI data center industry will continue to evolve as the demand for AI-driven applications grows. Experts predict a significant shift toward edge computing, where data centers are decentralized and located closer to the source of data generation. This reduces latency and improves performance for real-time AI applications such as autonomous driving and smart cities. Moreover, the integration of quantum computing into AI data centers could revolutionize the field. Quantum computers are capable of processing complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers, making them ideal for AI and big data applications. Companies like IBM and Google are already exploring quantum technology in their AI research.

27,2024-07-31 09:06:32+00:00,Microsoft stock drops after results fall short in latest AI disappointment, Daniel Howley    · Technology Editor,"Microsoft (MSFT) released its fiscal fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, beating on the top and bottom lines, but missing on cloud revenue expectations.
For the quarter, Microsoft reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.95 on revenue of $64.7 billion. Wall Street was anticipating EPS of $2.94 on revenue of $64.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft reported EPS of $2.69 and revenue of $56.2 billion during the same period last year.
Microsoft's overall cloud revenue came in at $36.8 billion, in line with expectations of $36.8 billion, but the company's Intelligent Cloud revenue, which includes its Azure services, fell short, coming in at $28.5 billion versus expectations of $28.7 billion.
Shares of Microsoft were about 2% lower in pre-market trading on Wednesday, having fallen over 7% earlier in the wake of the results.
While Microsoft's cloud business missed expectations, overall revenue still rose 21% year over year. Intelligent Cloud revenue, meanwhile, increased 19% year over year. What's more, Microsoft said AI services contributed 8 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue, which increased by 29%.
Microsoft's AI miss sent shares of fellow AI-heavy companies like Meta lower in after-hours trading. The social media giant was off more than 3% on the news.
The report follows rival and Google parent Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) earnings announcement last week, during which the company said it is seeing an uptick in cloud revenue partially due to interest in AI products.
Still, Google didn’t offer specific numbers on the impact of AI on the cloud business, leaving some analysts like UBS’s Stephen Ju to predict that revenue benefits from the company’s AI spending might not come until the first half of 2025 at the earliest.
According to UBS analyst Karl Keirstead, Microsoft has also been grabbing more market share from Google and Amazon.
“In terms of share shifts among AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, the most consistent theme in this round of checks was the number of customers and partners that cited share gains by Microsoft resulting from its early lead on the AI front,” Keirstead wrote in a recent note about the three major cloud players.
“This has been a recurring theme from checks over the last 6-12 months and the commentary about Azure’s relative strength felt consistent with prior checks,” he added.
During Alphabet’s earnings call, CFO Ruth Porat said the company spent $13 billion on capital expenditures, up from $12 billion in the prior quarter, adding that the vast majority of that spending is going toward AI.
Amazon (AMZN) is set to report earnings on Aug. 1.
Shares of Google are up 22% year to date, while shares of Amazon are up 23%.

Constellation Energy Corp., the biggest US operator of reactors, expects Three Mile Island to go back into service in 2028, according to a statement Friday. While one of the site’s two units permanently closed almost a half-century ago after the worst US nuclear accident, Constellation is planning to reopen the other reactor, which shut in 2019 because it couldn’t compete economically.
Shares of Constellation Energy jumped as much as 22%, the most on record, to an all-time high on Friday.
Microsoft has agreed to purchase the energy for two decades and declined to disclose financial terms. This is the first time Microsoft has secured a dedicated, 100% nuclear facility for its use.
The decision is the latest sign of surging interest in the nuclear industry as power demand for AI soars. More than a dozen reactors went dark over roughly the past decade in the face of increasing competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. But growing demand for electricity — from factories, cars and especially from data centers — has spurred interest in nuclear plants that can provide carbon-free power around the clock.
“Policymakers and the market have received a huge wake-up call,” Constellation Chief Executive Officer Joe Dominguez said in an interview. “There’s no version of the future of this country that doesn’t rely on these nuclear assets.”
Constellation — which has seen its shares jump this year thanks to mounting investor awareness of the value of power plants — plans to fund the project from its own coffers rather than seek state or federal support. That’s in contrast to Holtec International, which is pursuing the only other disclosed effort to restart a closed reactor, with about $1.8 billion in conditional funding from the US Energy Department and the state of Michigan. NextEra Energy Inc. has also said it’s considering reviving a closed Iowa reactor, in part to supply data-center customers. However, beyond these three, experts say there are few other mothballed reactors that may be suitable for restarting.
While Constellation isn’t averse to outside financial support, Dominguez said government approvals move slowly and he doesn’t want to wait. Work at Three Mile Island is expected to start immediately. The deal to supply Microsoft with electricity from the 837-megawatt reactor is Constellation’s biggest-ever power purchase deal.
The restart effort has been in the works since early 2023, when Constellation began evaluating whether it made sense to switch the reactor back on. By early this year, the company had concluded that it wanted to pursue the project, and began talking to potential customers. Microsoft was immediately interested, Dominguez said.
The nuclear power purchase will aid Microsoft’s plans to run all of its massive global network of data centers on clean energy by 2025, Bobby Hollis, Microsoft’s vice president for energy, said in an interview. This nuclear energy will be used to fuel data-center expansion in areas like Chicago, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
While the additional nuclear power will help Microsoft’s climate goals, it does not address the most intractable issue – emissions from concrete, steel and chips used in the data centers, Hollis said.
“This is not a simple piece, but it’s easier than figuring out how to decarbonize the entire supply chain,” he said.
Still, data centers make a useful customer for nuclear power. Wind and solar power outputs can vary, while a nuclear plant generally runs constantly and requires a customer that can take all of that electricity, Hollis said. That makes tech companies selling cloud computing an ideal option.
“We run around the clock. They run around the clock,” he said.
Microsoft isn't the only tech company looking to nuclear power to fuel its AI ambitions. Earlier this year, Amazon.com Inc.'s cloud computing division agreed to spend $650 million to acquire a data center campus connected to Talen Energy Corp.’s 40-year-old nuclear power plant on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania.
While the Three Mile Island reactor was mothballed in 2019, Dominguez said the equipment is still in good shape. Still, restarting it will require significant investments in the main transformer, turbine and cooling systems. The company will have to restaff the facility and must seek approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Constellation will also seek to extend its operating license through 2054, and is planning to rename the facility the Crane Clean Energy Center, after the late Chris Crane, former CEO of Exelon Corp., which spun out its generation unit to become Constellation in 2022.
One of the biggest hurdles will be connecting the plant to the power grid operated by PJM Interconnection LLC, which has a lengthy queue. If PJM can move fast enough, Dominguez said the facility could potentially be ready to supply power as early as 2027.
“I’m so glad we’re reversing a terrible mistake that shouldn’t have happened,” he said. “It will be a lot more difficult to achieve the energy transition if we only want to use wind and solar and storage.”

29,2024-09-15 17:48:24+00:00,Bill Gates explains the keys to his success during Microsoft’s early years,  Jason Ma ,"Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates looked at the big picture and the small picture as he was growing his software company in the early years.
In an interview with CNBC's Make It published on Wednesday, the tech billionaire revealed that his definition of success included his software and its global impact.
""Back then, it was just: Is my code really good? Does it work? And can this company show the world that these microcomputers are big?"" Gates said.
His view also spoke to his evangelism about the potential of personal computers to transform business and society. While the PC's impact is clear now, it wasn't obvious to everyone four decades ago, even to some of the early innovators.
In 1981, IBM launched its PC and famously estimated that it would only sell 241,683 units over a five-year period. Instead, it sold about 3 million in that time and hundreds of millions over a decade.
Of course, all those PCs needed software, and that's where Gates saw an opportunity, applying a relentless single-mindedness to it.
""It was the magic of software,"" he told CNBC. ""And I was willing to focus my life, in my 20s, just on software, just on the one job.""
In fact, he and Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen had a vision of putting a PC on every desk and in every home, ""which sounds boring today, but back then [it] was completely crazy,"" Gates added.
Looking back on those early years, he characterized his view of success as ""very much Microsoft-centric,"" describing his life during his 20s as ""all Microsoft, all the time.""
Gates stepped down as CEO in 2000, gave up his day-to-day duties in 2008, relinquished his chairmanship role in 2014, and left the board in 2020. Now focused on his philanthropy, he said his definition of success has evolved and includes ""adding net value"" to the world as well as empowering other people.
During a commencement address to Northern Arizona University’s graduating class in 2023, he expressed some regret for his approach to work in Microsoft's early years, when he said he didn't believe in weekends or vacations and pushed others to put in long hours.
""As I got older—and especially once I became a father—I realized that both in terms of doing your best work and having a great life, that that intensity was not always appropriate,"" he said. ""Don’t wait as long as I did to learn this lesson.""
But he still plans on staying busy, telling CNBC earlier that he intends to keep working for at least another two decades if his health allows—following in the footsteps of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. That’s because retirement “sounds awful” to Gates.

30,2024-10-10 10:00:26+00:00,Meta Platforms or Microsoft: Oppenheimer Chooses the Superior AI Stock to Buy,  TipRanks ,"The tech sector has been powering market gains over the past year, and AI stocks have been at the forefront of tech. AI has the potential to overturn the tech world and recast the general economy; in doing so, it also has the potential to be a gold mine for investors.
But not every AI stock will fully realize that potential. Some are clearly going to lead in innovation or bring higher returns, and Wall Street’s analysts are busy now sorting out the equity landscape to find those shining opportunities.
Covering the AI/tech world from Oppenheimer, two 5-star analysts are taking divergent views on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Both companies have been making waves in the AI world lately; Microsoft was an early backer of generative AI, while Meta has recently been finding innovative ways to use the technology.
So, let’s take a closer look to find out which one is the investment bank’s choice as the superior AI stock to buy.
Meta Platforms
We’ll start with Meta, the parent firm of Facebook and the world’s leader in the social media field. The company was founded as Facebook, 20 years ago; in 2021, after Facebook had made several social media acquisitions, the company rebranded as Meta Platforms. Today, Meta owns and operates Facebook, as well as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Through these platforms, the company can reach out to a huge audience – at the end of 2Q24 this year, Meta reported a Daily Active People (DAP) number of 3.27 billion, or nearly 40% of the world’s total population. An audience of that magnitude is an asset that cannot be discounted.
Meta’s audience-asset lies at the heart of the company’s chief revenue driver, digital advertising. This is Meta’s core business, and in the second quarter of this year, the last quarter reported, the company showed a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across its platforms – as well as a 10% increase in the average price paid per ad. That led to a 22% year-over-year revenue gain, to a quarterly top line of $39.07 billion – a figure that also beat the forecast by $760 million. At the bottom line, Meta beat the Q2 forecast again, with the $5.16 EPS coming in 40 cents per share ahead of expectations.
Solid revenues and consistent profits are only part of the story, however. Meta has been preparing itself to meet the future of the online world – and understands that that future is AI. The company is no stranger to AI tech, having put it to use in developing targeted digital advertising over the past several years, and using AI in its translation algorithms to make its social media platforms more widely accessible.
But the real work is in generative AI, and Meta has two chief developments in this field. The first is Llama, Meta’s open-source AI software model. The company has already released Llama 3, and aims to use the platform to create a flexible and readily usable AI environment. Making the platform open-source allows users to develop tweaks and additions that will meet idiosyncratic needs, as well as permitting the public to make improvements.
In addition to Llama, Meta has released an online AI chatbot/assistant, dubbed Meta AI. This interactive tool is available across all of the company’s social platforms, and has rapidly become a successful addition to the company’s toolbox – and popular with users. The chatbot had 400 million monthly active users at the end of August this year, with that number trending upwards quickly. Meta created Meta AI as a gen AI challenger to ChatGPT, and is well on that path.
For Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, the most important factor here is Meta AI. He notes the recent expansion of the online assistant, and lays out how it will benefit the company as a whole. “META AI on track to be most-used AI assistant by year-end, ~500M MAU, with more country launches,” the 5-star analyst explained. “We believe the long term benefits from AI content recommendation, ad targeting, business messaging and ads generation will become more exciting to investors overtime, and support META’s terminal value. We believe China ecommerce remains strong, with results/guidance implying continued acceleration on 2-year growth (and no cautionary comments). Near term, we are also encouraged from the positive commentary surrounding US Facebook and Whatsapp young adult engagement.”
These comments support Helfstein’s Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, although his price target of $615 implies a modest 4% gain on the 12-month horizon, a low upside that is indicative of the stock’s continued gains (up 68% year-to-date). (To watch Helfstein’s track record, click here)
Overall, META shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 46 recent reviews that include 42 to Buy, 3 to Hold, and 1 to Sell. However, due to the strong rally, the average target price of $611.20 suggests an upside of just 3% over the coming year. (See Meta stock forecast)
Microsoft Corporation
Now on to another tech giant. Microsoft made its name in the 70s and 80s as a leader in the PC market, and now its Windows operating systems and Office software packages have become the industry standard for home, small business, and enterprise-level PCs and laptops. Microsoft has managed this through a combination of developing quality products that do what the user needs and wants – and through smart marketing, making its Windows logo one of the world’s most recognizable brands. Today, Microsoft boasts a market cap of $3.08 trillion and is the world’s third-largest publicly traded company.
Like Meta above, Microsoft has not been resting on its laurels. The company reached the top of the heap on its track record of proven products, and it’s using its deep resources and long expertise to adapt itself to the changes that AI is bringing to the world of tech. One of the most prominent of Microsoft’s uses of AI is the integration of the AI-powered Copilot online assistant feature to its Windows and Office software packages.
Microsoft has been able to do this by building on its status as an early backer of generative AI tech. The company put billions into OpenAI, the firm that brought ChatGPT to the market – $13 billion, more precisely. In return for that investment, Microsoft has secured rights to 75% of OpenAI’s future profits. Microsoft’s royalties will drop to 49% once the initial investment is recouped.
The company’s large AI investment hasn’t just brought it an additional income stream – Microsoft has also been able to integrate generative AI technology into its search engine, Bing. Bringing AI to the search engine has made the engine more responsive to natural language queries and improved search results, both of which make the search feature easier to use and more competitive with Google.
AI has also become ever-more important to Microsoft’s cloud computing system, Azure, which competes with Google’s Cloud and Amazon’s AWS. Azure already has more than 200 cloud-based software tools available to subscribers, and adding AI to the mix provides enhancements and greater flexibility for users.
Building out all of these AI features and tools, and adding them to existing platforms, does not come cheap – but as noted, Microsoft has deep pockets. And the company has buttressed that with consistent revenue growth. In the last quarter reported, fiscal 4Q24, the company brought in $64.7 billion at the top line, beating the forecast by $260 million and growing 15% year-over-year. The company’s earnings came to $2.95 per share, up 10% y/y and 2 cents per share ahead of the forecast.
The company’s Azure cloud segment, however, grew at a slower pace than expected – rising 29% y/y compared to the 30% to 31% revenue growth that analysts were looking for.
5-star analyst Timothy Horan, however, is more worried about potential slowdowns and headwinds in the AI field. In his Oppenheimer note on MSFT, Horan explains his position, “We believe estimates for revenue and EPS are too high. Open AI losses are the primary concern and could be in the $2-3B range in FY25, which we were not previously modeling. As per our recent AI report, enterprises have been slow to adopt AI and associated revenues will likely disappoint. Other factors include the impact of heightened CapEx on higher depreciation, lower interest income and higher OpEx to support AI. Because MSFT are investing in once-in-a-generation technology, we don’t believe expanding margins will be a short-term priority. MSFT is trading at the midpoint of its five-year range of ~25x-35x P/E, and could trade to the lower end.”
Horan follows this by downgrading his stance on MSFT from Outperform to Perform (Hold) and withholding a price target for the stock. (To watch Horan’s track record, click here)
While the Oppenheimer view is cautious, Wall Street remains bullish on Microsoft. The 30 recent reviews, including a lopsided 22 to 3 Buy-Hold ratio, give the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating, while the $504.73 average target price and $414.71 trading price together suggest a 22% gain on the one-year horizon.

Revenue from Azure, Microsoft’s main growth engine in recent years, rose 29% in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared with a 31% jump in the previous period. About 8 percentage points of the increase in the recent period was attributable to AI, up from 7 percentage points in the prior quarter.
“It was really about the cloud services number — it needed to just be a little higher,” Doug Clinton, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said on Bloomberg Television. Still, the accelerated contribution from AI confirms business momentum with that emerging technology, wrote Raimo Lenschow, an analyst at Barclays.
Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been infusing Microsoft’s product line with AI technology from partner OpenAI, including digital assistants called Copilots that can summarize documents and generate computer code, emails and other content. The company also is selling Azure cloud subscriptions featuring OpenAI products. Alongside rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Google, Microsoft has been spending billions to construct new data centers to meet demand for cloud computing and power-hungry AI services.
On a call with analysts Tuesday, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said that although Azure growth will continue to slow in the current quarter, which ends in September, investments in data centers and servers will let the company capitalize on demand and accelerate Azure growth in the second half of fiscal 2025.
Microsoft shares fell less than 1% on Wednesday as the markets opened in New York. As of the Tuesday close, the stock had gained about 12% in 2024.
In the fourth quarter, which ended June 30, capital expenditures — closely watched by investors as the company embarks on its historic AI build-out — jumped to $19 billion, including server farm leases, from $14 billion in the previous quarter. That number will increase in the new fiscal year, Hood said.
In an interview, investor relations chief Brett Iversen said Microsoft currently lacks sufficient capacity to fulfill customer demand for cloud and AI services. “We’re building out for that as quickly as we can,” he said.
In recent weeks, skittish investors have signaled impatience with tech companies’ efforts to profit from their massive investments in AI. Last week, the shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. sank after the company surprised Wall Street with sharply higher costs that overshadowed strong sales.
Many of Microsoft’s corporate customers are only just starting to use new AI assistants, which still struggle to understand the context of some requests and handle commands involving multiple apps. The Copilot service, which doubles the cost of a monthly subscription to about $60 per user for corporations, is expected to eventually generate a robust flow of recurring revenue.
Iversen said customers are increasingly adopting the company’s higher-tier Office 365 product, which includes generative AI features. Sales from commercial cloud products including Azure and office applications rose 21% to $36.8 billion, Microsoft said, about in line with Wall Street estimates.
Total revenue in the fourth quarter increased 15% to $64.7 billion, while adjusted profit was $2.95 a share, the company said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts on average estimated sales of $64.5 billion and per-share earnings of $2.94.
On the call, Nadella said the number of people using Copilot at work doubled quarter-over-quarter. Use of Copilot within GitHub, which allows for AI assistance in software development, accounts for 40% of revenue growth within that business, he added.
The company’s Xbox video-gaming unit posted 61% growth in content and services revenue, much of that fueled by the $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, which was completed in October.
Hours before reporting its financial results, Microsoft’s Azure and Office 365 services suffered partial outages, which also took down services by customers including Starbucks Corp.
Just a couple of weeks earlier, some 8 million computers running Microsoft’s Windows operating system crashed after the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. released a flawed software update. Though the outage was caused by CrowdStrike, “Microsoft may still have to deal with negative perception around perceived vulnerabilities to its operating system,” Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup, wrote ahead of earnings.
Nadella touted progress in the company’s cybersecurity products during the call with investors. The company says it has more than 1.2 million security customers, and Defender for Cloud, a security product, passed $1 billion in revenue over the past year. “We continue to prioritize security above all else,” Nadella said.

32,2024-10-10 20:32:01+00:00,Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT): Leading the AI Revolution and Driving Tech Growth,  Attiya Zainib ,"We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. Since Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.
Venu Krishna, Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that he is not revising his S&P 500 year-end projection of 5,600 because he believes stock valuations are “full.”
“If you see what’s happening, numbers (earnings)  have been cut sharply going into the end. What is still anchoring the market is big tech, even though their earnings themselves are kind of decelerating. Then seasonality comes into play. October is the weakest month, and you don’t want to get ahead of that.”
Asked whether he does not believe the market really broadened out, Krishna said while there were some signs of market broadening, the “anchor” of the rally remains big tech, which according to him, are just six stocks.
Moving beyond the earnings and valuations debate, another factor still impacting investor sentiment is the Federal Reserve’s next moves.
Talking about the latest Fed minutes released October 9,  Wolfe Research’s Stephanie Roth said on CNBC that a “substantial” majority of Fed officials wanted a 50-basis-point rate cut. However, she said in the next meeting, a 50bps rate cut is “off the table.”
For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news. With each stock we mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Wedbush Securities highlights Nvidia and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) as frontrunners in the ongoing AI revolution, with new data suggesting the AI infrastructure market could expand tenfold by 2027. AI spending is rising across the tech supply chain, driven by the regular launch of generative AI projects in enterprise settings, according to Dan Ives. This signals that AI is becoming a “top priority” for IT budgets heading into 2025, potentially unlocking new AI applications.
“While Nvidia and Microsoft are the core drivers of AI now, we are seeing many other tech stalwarts join the AI party, including Oracle, ServiceNow, Palantir, Salesforce, Dell, IBM, Apple, AMD among others,” Ives said. He believes tech stocks are poised to gain more than 10% by year-end, with an additional 20% rise expected in 2025, as the AI-driven tech bull market enters its next phase.
However, some believe OpenAI was the only key edge Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) had in the AI race and it’s quickly fading away.
DA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company’s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum.
Luria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA’s, according to Luria.
Following a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft’s dependence on NVIDIA.
Luria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins.
The analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities.
The concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta’s Llama 3.1.
Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Generative AI’s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI’s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called ‘inference’). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category – nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google’s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years.
Overall, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. While we acknowledge the potential Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

33,2024-09-04 11:37:20+00:00,UK clears Microsoft's partnership with Inflection AI,Reuters ,"(Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator, on Wednesday, cleared Microsoft's hiring of some former staff of Inflection AI and its partnership with the startup and said the deal did not required a deeper investigation.
The Competition and Markets Authority began a probe in July to examine if the deal might lead to competition concerns in the country since both companies develop and supply consumer chatbots.
The CMA said that even before being bought, Inflection had a small portion of UK visits for chatbots and AI tools and, unlike its rivals, couldn't significantly grow or maintain its chatbot users.
In March, Microsoft hired Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of Google DeepMind, as head of its newly-created AI unit. It also hired a number of employees from Inflection, which he set up in 2022.
Reuters reported that Microsoft had agreed to pay about $650 million as part of the deal, which gave it access to Inflection's AI models and enabled the startup to reimburse its investors, who include former Bill Gates and Google CEO Eric Schmidt.

34,2024-05-10 21:13:00+00:00,Microsoft hit with $242 million US verdict in Cortana patent lawsuit,  Blake Brittain ,"By Blake Brittain
(Reuters) - Microsoft must pay patent owner IPA Technologies $242 million, a federal jury in Delaware said on Friday after determining that Microsoft's Cortana virtual-assistant software infringed an IPA patent.
The jury agreed with IPA after a week-long trial that Microsoft's voice-recognition technology violates IPA's patent rights in computer-communications software.
IPA is a subsidiary of patent-licensing company Wi-LAN, which is jointly owned by Canadian technology company Quarterhill and two investment firms. It bought the patent and others from SRI International's Siri Inc, which Apple acquired in 2010 and whose technology it used in its Siri virtual assistant.
""We remain confident that Microsoft never infringed on IPA's patents and will appeal,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.
Representatives for IPA and Wi-LAN did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict.
IPA filed the lawsuit in 2018, accusing Microsoft of infringing patents related to personal digital assistants and voice-based data navigation.
The case was later narrowed to concern one IPA patent. Microsoft argued that it does not infringe and that the patent is invalid.
IPA has also sued Google and Amazon over its patents. Amazon defeated IPA's lawsuit in 2021, and the Google case is still ongoing.

35,2024-07-09 18:04:18+00:00,Microsoft ordered employees in China to only use iPhones due to security threats,  Paolo Confino ,"Microsoft will require its employees in China to only use iPhones due to their enhanced security features.
The move comes as Microsoft undertakes a major cybersecurity overhaul. The project, internally known as the Secure Future Initiative, comes after Microsoft faced scrutiny for its subpar security practices. Microsoft’s new policy, which will go into effect in September, means that employees in China will only be allowed to use iPhones for work, as first reported by Bloomberg. The new rule is meant to effectively limit the number of Android phones used by Microsoft’s Chinese employees.
Microsoft will begin requiring employees to verify their identities and use two-factor authentication when logging into their work phones.
Microsoft had to ask its employees to only use iPhones for work because certain security apps like Microsoft Authenticator and the Identity Pass app weren’t available on any other operating systems in China. In the U.S. and other countries, those two apps are also available on Google Play. But Google Play doesn’t operate in China, which means Microsoft’s employees could only get the relevant security apps on an Apple iPhone.
“Due to the lack of availability of Google Mobile Services in this region, we look to offer employees a means of accessing these required apps, such as an iOS device,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Fortune in an email.
Employees in China who don’t have an iPhone will be given one by Microsoft, according to Bloomberg.
Chinese Android phones made by companies like Huawei and Xiaomi operate their own platforms. Microsoft’s banning of Chinese smartphones is emblematic of a diverging digital ecosystem between China and the U.S. where the two governments and major corporations that work with them have become increasingly wary of allowing the other to access sensitive materials.
China has its own search engines and social media platforms, where U.S. giants like Facebook are banned. Its internet censors are legendary for their breadth and strictness. Meanwhile, in the U.S. the White House has limited exports of the most sophisticated semiconductor technology to Chinese companies. And Congress passed a bill that would force the sale of the Chinese-owned TikTok to an American buyer over concerns the social media platform could be used to influence public opinion.
Cyber security became a top priority for Microsoft after it was found its cloud systems were breached by state-backed Chinese hackers last year. The cyber attack came ahead of Secretary of State Anthony Blinken’s visit to Beijing in June 2023, further exacerbating tensions between the U.S. and China. The hack raised major red flags about Microsoft’s security practices. In April a federal agency released a scathing report that found “Microsoft’s security culture was inadequate.”
In March, a U.S. federal court charged a group of Chinese hackers for a separate set of cyber attacks that took place in 2018. The Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. said the charges were baseless. “Without valid evidence, the U.S. jumped to an unwarranted conclusion and made groundless accusations against China,” Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the embassy said at the time.
As the relationship between the U.S. and China becomes more fraught, both sides have tried to firewall the others’ cyber capabilities. Since 2023, Chinese government-backed companies have ordered employees to stop using foreign smartphones from manufacturers like Apple and Samsung. Meanwhile China has attempted to surveil parts of the U.S. with its own surreptitious methods. Early last year China sent several spy balloons into the U.S. Even electric vehicles and connected cars have been caught in the crosshairs, seen as a covert way to surveil Americans. The Biden administration is weighing a ban of all Chinese smart cars after a national security investigation found they collect data on passengers and use external sensors to gather information on U.S. infrastructure. A recent Fortune investigation found China’s self-driving cars have already traveled 1.8 million miles on American roads.
Those tensions have only grown after a report published on Tuesday by an Australian-led consortium of intelligence agencies including those from the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Germany detailed repeated cyber attacks from China’s top spy agency.

36,2024-07-01 20:38:25+00:00,"Ballmer Is Richer Than Gates, a First for Microsoft Billionaires",  Vernal Galpotthawela ,"(Bloomberg) -- Steve Ballmer passed Bill Gates on Monday to become the sixth-richest person in the world, the first time the former chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp. has been wealthier than the company’s co-founder.

The move came as Microsoft shares rose to a fresh record, bringing their total gain this year to 21%. The company, through its partnership with OpenAI, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence rally that has powered the US stock market higher.
More than 90% of Ballmer’s $157.2 billion net worth is in Microsoft shares, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Gates, meanwhile, has diversified his $156.7 billion fortune: About half his wealth is held through Cascade Investment, which was created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. He also owns a $21 billion stake in waste-management company Republic Services Inc. through Cascade.
Gates, 68, has been slowly reducing his fortune through philanthropy. Along with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates and his friend Warren Buffett, Gates has funneled billions of dollars of his personal money to build up the $75 billion Gates Foundation, one of the biggest charitable organizations in the world.
Since they started the foundation more than two decades ago, Gates and his former wife have given almost $60 billion from their personal fortunes. French Gates recently stepped down as co-chair of the foundation and received $12.5 billion to use for her own charitable purposes.
In 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world’s richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills. Ballmer, 68, who has not signed the Giving Pledge, has his own philanthropic work but nowhere on the scale of Gates.
Gates founded Microsoft with his friend Paul Allen in 1975 and led it until 2000, when Ballmer — one of the company’s earliest employees — replaced him as CEO. Ballmer retired in 2014 and became Microsoft’s largest shareholder that same year. He bought the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion in 2014, an investment that is estimated to be worth $4.6 billion today.

37,2024-06-04 10:36:09+00:00,Microsoft lays off hundreds from Azure cloud division,  GlobalData ,"Microsoft has initiated layoffs impacting hundreds of employees within its Azure cloud business, reported Business Insider, citing sources.
The reductions have affected the Azure for Operators and Mission Engineering teams, which are integral parts of the Strategic Missions and Technologies (SMT) division.
SMT was established in 2021 to focus on advanced projects such as quantum computing and space technologies.
One of the sources said that the job cuts within the Azure for Operators team could number as many as 1,500.
The SMT division, led by former Azure head Jason Zander, was formed to consolidate Microsoft's 'moonshot' initiatives, including its government cloud services.
Microsoft is known to make minor workforce adjustments at the end of its fiscal year on 30 June, but the frequency of layoffs has increased both at Microsoft and across the tech industry.
Last year, Microsoft announced it would reduce its workforce by 10,000 employees in the early months of 2023, and it has since implemented additional layoffs.
Requests for comment from Microsoft did not elicit a response.
The news of Microsoft's layoffs coincides with reports from CNBC that Alphabet is also reducing staff across various teams within Google's cloud unit.
According to internal communications seen by CNBC, at least 100 positions have been eliminated, spanning sales, consulting, strategy, operations, and engineering.
A spokesperson for Google informed CNBC that these incremental cuts across teams are part of an effort to better align its market strategy.
“As we have shared before, we continue to evolve our business to meet our customers’ priorities and the significant opportunity ahead,” the spokesperson was quoted by CNBC as saying.
“We maintain our commitment to investing in areas that are critical to our business and ensure our long-term success.”

38,2024-09-20 13:00:00+00:00,Better AI Stock: Microsoft vs. Alphabet,"  Chris Neiger, The Motley Fool ","The artificial intelligence (AI) race is still in its early stages, though it might not feel like it, and there's still plenty of time for tech companies to overtake each other. For investors looking for opportunities in the space, it may be appealing to pick a small AI start-up that might grow by leaps and bounds, but larger companies have deeper pockets, making their AI investments (and shifting strategies) much more likely to succeed.
Which ones will prove to be the best AI stocks in the coming years? Let's take a look at what Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are doing to shore up their AI dominance, and consider which one is more likely to be the better artificial intelligence stock in the coming years.
Let's start with the most obviously smart AI move Microsoft has made: It invested an estimated $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. That gave Microsoft early access to some of the most advanced AI models available, and it wisely started embedding them into nearly all of its software products.
ChatGPT is the underlying AI tech in Microsoft's Copilot tools, which are now in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. The software bundle they comprise, Microsoft 365, is used by 1.3 million companies in the U.S. alone. For tens of millions of workers, Microsoft's software is now synonymous with the advanced AI tools they use every day.
This integration is already paying off for Microsoft, and the best example may come from the company's GitHub developer platform, in which 40% of its recent revenue growth came from Copilot, according to management. Microsoft's leadership said on the fourth-quarter earnings call that AI is driving GitHub's growth and has boosted its annual revenue run rate to $2 billion.
Of course, Microsoft isn't just a software company these days. Its Azure unit is the second-largest cloud computing infrastructure provider in the world, with 25% of the market. Microsoft has integrated new AI tools into Azure, and management said on the Q2 earnings call that Azure now has 60,000 AI customers -- a 60% increase from the prior-year period.
Microsoft will probably make another noteworthy AI investment soon. OpenAI is about to have another funding round, and Microsoft is reportedly going to participate. Keeping OpenAI close is a wise bet right now. Microsoft is already benefiting from the companies' close working relationship, and there's no reason to believe it won't continue to reap the rewards in the near future.
Alphabet has long been a major player in artificial intelligence, mostly with behind-the-scenes tech. For example, AI is a fundamental part of the systems that provide its Google Search results and YouTube recommendations, which feed relevant content to users and help power its ad business.
But on the generative AI front, Alphabet had to play catch-up over the past two years, releasing its own AI model called Gemini to compete with ChatGPT, and integrating more AI-powered responses into its search results.
So far, Gemini appears to be a success. On Alphabet's second-quarter earnings call, management said that all six of its Workspace products, which have more than 2 billion users, are now using Gemini. Gemini is sold as an add-on feature to the company's suite of products.
But one of the biggest AI opportunities for Alphabet may be in cloud computing. Google Cloud is the third-largest cloud infrastructure provider (behind Amazon Web Services and Azure), and its artificial intelligence integrations are already paying off. Google Cloud sales increased 29% in the second quarter to $10.3 billion, and part of that growth came from ""increasing contribution from AI,"" according to Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat.
And, just like Microsoft, Alphabet has made investments in AI start-ups. Most notable was its $2 billion investment in OpenAI rival Anthropic, which makes the popular AI chatbot Claude. The investment should help Alphabet keep abreast of the newest AI capabilities coming from start-ups.
While both of these companies could be good long-term AI plays, I think Microsoft has an edge over Alphabet for two reasons.
First, Microsoft has a 49% ownership stake in OpenAI, which is arguably the leading generative AI software company right now. The decision to hitch its wagon to OpenAI's tech already looks like a smart one, and Microsoft could continue to benefit as OpenAI releases more advanced models and new services down the road.
Second, while Alphabet will benefit from selling AI services for Google Cloud, Microsoft is a larger cloud company and will probably see more benefit from AI-related demand. Goldman Sachs estimates cloud revenue from all tech companies could climb to $2 trillion by 2030, and much of the growth will be fueled by AI. With Microsoft already holding a quarter of the cloud market, it's well positioned to benefit.
Microsoft trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 32, which is more expensive than Alphabet's forward P/E of 17.6. ​​While I'd usually prefer to pick the stock that's technically less expensive, I think Microsoft has enough of a jump on its rivals in the AI space that it could outperform them in the software and cloud computing arenas for years to come.

One center will help develop best practices and industry standards for the responsible use of AI, according to a statement Tuesday. The US firm will also open its first ‘AI for Good Research Lab’ in the region to support social goals, including advancing food security and strengthening climate resilience.
“We are committed to additional steps with G42 that advance responsible AI use for customers and that strengthen the relationship not only between our two companies, but between our two countries,” Brad Smith, vice chairman and president of Microsoft, said in a statement.
The moves build on Microsoft’s partnership with G42, which is seeking to become an AI superpower in the Middle East. It’s part of the $1.5 trillion empire of Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who’s one of Abu Dhabi’s deputy rulers, national security adviser of the UAE and brother to its president.
G42 has also teamed up with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, which is looking to expand in the Gulf region.
The Abu Dhabi-based firm has drawn criticism in Washington in the past, with one lawmaker calling for sanctions citing alleged links to Chinese businesses including Huawei Technologies Co. G42 denied it had “connections to the Chinese government and their military industrial complex.”

The US has limited chip exports to the Middle East in part due to concerns that Chinese companies, which are largely cut off from cutting-edge American technology, could access them through data centers in the Middle East.
The UAE’s minister for artificial intelligence told Bloomberg Television in June that US concerns were justified. Still, Semafor reported earlier this month that the US had approved the sale of Nvidia Corp. chips to the Abu Dhabi firm.

42,2024-10-05 15:09:52+00:00,The big winner if OpenAI becomes a for-profit business? Microsoft., Alexis Keenan    and Daniel Howley    ,"OpenAI is considering transitioning from a nonprofit into a for-profit company, and its deep-pocketed benefactor, Microsoft (MSFT), has a lot to gain if the ChatGPT developer gets the green light to act more like a startup.
""Anything that frees up OpenAI to focus on profit is likely to benefit Microsoft's investment in the company,"" said Sarah Kreps, director of the Tech Policy Institute in the Brooks School of Public Policy at Cornell University.
A reconfigured business structure would give Microsoft an opportunity to renegotiate its already generous profit cap, as well as discard a provision that denies Microsoft an interest in OpenAI-created general artificial intelligence (GAI), according to another observer.
“[OpenAI] is clearly saying that the nonprofit will no longer be in control, so presumably that means Microsoft and other investors will have more say about what OpenAI does,"" said Rose Chan Loui, founding executive director of the University of California Los Angeles's Lowell Milken Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofits.
But there are potential snags for Microsoft as OpenAI attempts to shed its charitable cloak.
OpenAI's huge valuation, labyrinth of for-profit subsidiaries, and potentially risky technology make a for-profit switch legally and publicly complicated — and could invite pushback from regulators.
Still, OpenAI's investors see plenty of upside. On Wednesday, the company announced it raised some $6.6 billion in its latest funding round, valuing the Sam Altman-helped firm at $157 billion. However, that valuation is largely contingent on OpenAI becoming a for-profit entity.
OpenAI is in the midst of a whirlwind of change.
It is experiencing an extended executive exodus including, most recently, the departure of chief technology officer Mira Murati. It also faces increased competition from rivals including Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon-backed (AMZN) Anthropic.
The reclassification to a for-profit structure would be yet another seismic shift for OpenAI, upending the way it was established nearly a decade ago.
It began in 2015 as a nonprofit under the name OpenAI Inc., a nod to its mission of advancing humanity instead of pursuing profits.
“The corporation is not organized for the private gain of any person,” OpenAI’s certificate of incorporation stated in its organizing documents, along with a promise to keep its technology as open source for public benefit.
Things evolved in 2019 when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and his team created a for-profit subsidiary to raise outside venture capital — including billions from Microsoft.
It was structured in such a way that the for-profit subsidiary, technically owned by a holding company owned by OpenAI employees and investors, remained under the control of the nonprofit and its board of directors while giving its biggest backer (Microsoft) no board seats and no voting power.
The inherent tension between these two parts of the enterprise is what contributed to a dramatic boardroom clash in 2023, when Altman was ousted by the board and then brought back five days later.
In the aftermath, Microsoft took a non-voting observer position on OpenAI’s board, only to relinquish that seat this year as both OpenAI and Microsoft came under more regulatory scrutiny.
The idea of upending the current structure has already attracted interest from US and European regulators and exacerbated an ideological divide between scientific and business leaders who warn that machine learning technologies like those developed by OpenAI should remain accessible to the public.
The technology, they argue, poses an existential threat to humankind and, therefore, should be operated in a way that's subject to public scrutiny.
OpenAI and Microsoft are also part of an ongoing inquiry by the US Federal Trade Commission over concerns that AI market consolidation is “distorting innovation and undermining fair competition.”
And multiple calls have been made for California’s attorney general to probe the legality of OpenAI’s business structure. One came from Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI with Altman. He sued OpenAI, Altman and 21 named OpenAI subsidiaries.
Musk said the defendants fraudulently promised that his $100 million in OpenAI investments would be used for public benefit.
A transition by OpenAI to for-profit status could also attract the attention of the Internal Revenue Service, given that OpenAI was granted tax-exempt status as a charitable organization.
One unknown question is to what extent Microsoft will be able to directly extract profits from its investments.
By law, a nonprofit must use its assets only for its stated charitable purposes. And OpenAI's assets, which include all of OpenAI's subsidiaries, may not be sold for anything less than fair market value.
The question regulators will want to confirm is, ""Did they get fair market value for the asset at the time?"" said Gene Takagi, a principal at NEO Law Group.
Chan Loui added that regulators would require OpenAI to realistically value its assets, including residual interest. And she suspects that figure may be in excess of OpenAI's latest valuation.
“I think the greatest sensitivity probably is with how they remove the nonprofit's control,” she said. ""And I think their best shot of avoiding conflict relating to restructuring is to compensate the nonprofit enough,” Chan Loui said.
“I think that's the best way for them to get the public on their side, the states on their side, and the IRS on their side.""
What OpenAI is expected to do as part of its transition is register as a public benefit corporation.
Such entities are like traditional corporations but with more freedom to spend on civically minded initiatives, according to Rick Alexander, a veteran corporate structuring lawyer and founder of the Shareholder Commons,
""It's a permission structure,"" Alexander said.
Other public benefit corporations include Elon Musk's xAI, Warby Parker (WRBY), Allbirds (BIRD), Lemonade (LMND), and Etsy (ETSY).
And based on the success of Musk's xAI, OpenAI could benefit handsomely from the change. In May, xAI raised $6 billion.
""This type of transition can generate considerable investor interest quickly,"" Kreps said. ""This is such a capital-intensive industry, so anything OpenAI can do to attract investment will act as a positive feedback loop and accelerate its advantages.""

44,2024-08-08 10:59:00+00:00,Palantir and Microsoft Partner to Deliver Enhanced Analytics and AI Services to Classified Networks for Critical National Security Operations,Business Wire ,"DENVER, August 08, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) announce today a significant advancement in their partnership to bring some of the most sophisticated and secure cloud, AI, and analytics capabilities to the U.S. Defense and Intelligence Community. This is a first-of-its-kind, integrated suite of technology that will allow critical national security missions to operationalize Microsoft’s best-in-class Large Language Models (LLMs) via Azure OpenAI (AOAI) Service within Palantir’s AI Platform (AIP) in Microsoft’s government and classified cloud environments.
Palantir and Microsoft have a long history operating in secure and accredited environments to deliver leading technology for the most critical U.S. Defense and Intelligence missions. Now, through this partnership, Palantir will deploy their suite of products – Foundry, Gotham, Apollo, and AIP – in Microsoft Azure Government and in the Azure Government Secret (DoD Impact Level 6) and Top Secret clouds. Palantir will also be an early adopter of Azure’s OpenAI Service in Microsoft’s Secret and Top Secret environments.
This integrated solution of Microsoft’s Azure cloud compute and powerful language models (GPT-4 and others) with Palantir’s Foundry data integration and ontology capabilities, and AIP’s use case building capabilities will help enable operators to safely and responsibly build AI-driven operational workloads across Defense and Intelligence verticals — from logistics, to contracting, to prioritization and action planning, and more.

Lumen's migration to Microsoft Azure and the use of Microsoft Entra solutions for security are expected to improve its cash flow by more than $20m in the next 12 months, while also enhancing customer experience.
Microsoft corporate vice president of Azure Core product and design Erin Chapple said: “AI is reshaping our daily lives and fundamentally changing how businesses operate. We are focused both on the impact and opportunity for customers relative to AI today, and a generation ahead when it comes to our network infrastructure.
“Lumen has the network infrastructure and the digital capabilities needed to help support Azure’s mission in creating reliable and scalable platform that supports the breadth of customer workloads—from general purpose and mission-critical, to cloud-native, high-performance computing, and AI, plus what’s on the horizon.”
Lumen Technologies president and CEO Kate Johnson said: “We are preparing for a future where AI is the driving force of innovation and growth, and where a powerful network infrastructure is essential for companies to thrive.
“Microsoft has an ambitious vision for AI and this level of innovation requires a network that can make it reality. Lumen’s expansive network meets this challenge, with unique routes, unmatched coverage, and a digital platform built to give companies the flexibility, access and security they need to create an AI-enabled world.”
Microsoft recently unveiled plans for new data centres in Spain's Aragon region, representing an investment exceeding $7bn (€6.4bn).
These facilities, to be constructed near Zaragoza, align with Microsoft's investment in a new AI centre outside Madrid.
""Microsoft partners with Lumen to enhance AI data centre capabilities "" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.

46,2024-10-07 11:00:00+00:00,"Enbridge Collaborates with Microsoft to Use AI for Enhanced Safety, Emissions Reduction, and Asset Optimization",CNW Group ,"CALGARY, AB, Oct. 7, 2024 /CNW/ - Enbridge Inc. (TSX: ENB) (NYSE: ENB), in collaboration with Microsoft, is harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to drive significant advancements in safety, emissions reduction, and asset optimization across its operations.
Building on a strong digital foundation, the company began implementing AI over five years ago and is now leveraging it to support operational and environmental excellence.
""Our long-term collaboration with Microsoft has enabled us to apply cutting edge technology, which is helping to solve critical business problems and deliver powerful outcomes,"" said Bhushan Ivaturi, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer at Enbridge. ""The investments we're making today will play a critical role in enabling technological solutions to the biggest challenges in the evolution of our energy systems as we transition to a lower-carbon future.""
Enbridge embarked on a digital transformation in 2020 to drive productivity and efficiency and empower employees with the tools and capabilities they need for personal productivity. At the core of this strategy was a secure and modern technology foundation enabled by Microsoft.
This led to an ambitious cloud migration and modernization program, with over 80 percent of workloads moved to Microsoft Azure cloud platform within two years. This initiative not only enhanced computing, network, and storage capabilities but also bolstered cybersecurity measures and reduced data centre emissions through server decommissioning and a smaller physical facility footprint. Today, that strong digital foundation has positioned Enbridge as a leader in AI. Earlier this year, Enbridge rolled out Microsoft 365 Copilot to nearly one third of all employees, while the entire workforce has access to Bing Enterprise and ChatENB, an internal chat bot using Azure OpenAI Service.
""The Enbridge leadership team drove a cloud-first strategy, a big bet that opened the door to broader opportunity that positions Enbridge today to take full advantage of AI,"" said Tom Kubik, Enterprise Commercial Multi-Industry Lead at Microsoft Canada. ""We are proud of the work we've done together and are working towards our common goals of supporting a more connected and collaborative workforce and increasing data and analytics capabilities.""
AI-Powered Initiatives
Enbridge is leveraging AI across its operations to optimize assets, increase efficiencies, enhance safety, and contribute to its broader sustainability goals. Powered by Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, key examples include:
Energy Optimizer
The Energy Optimizer tool leverages AI to provide real-time operational insights, enabling Control Center operators to make decisions about how to move the energy Enbridge transports in the most efficient way possible. By managing the amount of power required, Enbridge can achieve cost savings and GHG reductions, while ensuring the safe, reliable and efficient operations of its liquid pipelines.
Right of Way Monitoring
Enbridge utilizes aerial surveillance to patrol its pipelines, detecting potentially damaging activities, conditions, or loss of containment. With AI, the company can now monitor the right of way more efficiently, reviewing data and detecting issues quicker and more accurately. This AI-driven approach has improved threat detection and response, significantly reducing the risk of third-party damage.
Integrity Engine
Enbridge employs intelligent automation for pipeline integrity, using AI to identify potential maintenance needs. Through workflow automation, data controls, advanced analysis, and machine learning models, the company gains new insights for rapid and effective asset maintenance, enhancing safety and efficiency while reducing process complexity and maintaining the health of our assets.
""Looking forward, we see ongoing opportunities and benefits of AI, in terms of data analytics, asset and process optimization, security and cost and emissions savings,"" said Ivaturi. ""At Enbridge, we are enabling the accessibility, sustainability, and security of energy through applied technology and innovation, and our collaboration with Microsoft will continue to play a pivotal role in that.""

48,2024-09-10 23:36:12+00:00,Microsoft hosts cybersecurity summit after global IT outage,Reuters ,"(Reuters) -Microsoft held a summit on Tuesday to discuss steps to improve cybersecurity systems, after a faulty software update from CrowdStrike caused a global IT outage in July.
The conference marked the first significant step by Microsoft to address the issues that affected nearly 8.5 million Windows devices on July 19, disrupting operations across industries ranging from major airlines to banks and healthcare.
It was held at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington.
The July outage raised concerns that many organizations are not well prepared to implement contingency plans when a single point of failure such as an IT system, or a piece of software within it, goes down. Analysts have said the outage also exposed risks of dependence on a single vendor providing a one-stop shop for security solutions.
Microsoft executive David Weston told the summit that the ""Windows security ecosystem must come together to innovate a safer and more reliable world,"" according to a Microsoft post on X.
Delta Air Lines has said it was pursuing legal claims against CrowdStrike and Microsoft, after the outage caused mass flight cancellations and cost the carrier at least $500 million.

49,2024-01-03 15:00:00+00:00,"If You Invested $10,000 in Microsoft When Satya Nadella Became CEO, This Is How Much You Would Have Today","  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ","Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is back on top of the tech world these days, but it's easy to forget that the company was left in the hinterlands for much of this century. While Microsoft was an early pioneer in personal computing with operating systems like DOS and then Windows, it missed the mobile transition, falling behind Apple after the iPhone was released.
A decade ago, Microsoft was regarded as a laggard in technology, known for a lack of innovation and underperforming the stock market, though it continued to generate profits from its entrenched personal computing and enterprise software ecosystem.
However, its legacy of underperformance changed when Satya Nadella took over as CEO nearly 10 years ago on Feb. 4, 2014.
Nadella overhauled Microsoft philosophically and strategically. He ended the company's war against Apple, allowing Microsoft Office products to be used on Apple devices. Nadella also invested heavily in Microsoft Azure, the company's cloud infrastructure business, which has grown to become the company's biggest profit driver. Azure is now the second-largest cloud infrastructure business behind Amazon Web Services, though it's growing significantly faster than its larger rival.
The Microsoft chief has made key acquisitions like LinkedIn, GitHub, and Activision Blizzard, diversifying the company and strengthening its pipeline upstream and downstream in areas like advertising and open-source code development. However, Nadella's biggest coup now seems to be the partnership he forged with OpenAI, of which Microsoft now owns nearly 50%. That partnership has made Microsoft a leader in generative artificial intelligence (AI), and OpenAI's technology has been incorporated across a range of products including Azure, its Office software suite, Bing search, and others.
That's helped make Microsoft a winner in 2023, and since Nadella took over, the stock gained 934%, outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin as the chart below shows.
According to those results, $10,000 invested in Microsoft when Nadella took the helm would now be worth $123,000 with dividends reinvested or $103,400 without dividends. That would give you a compound annual return of 29% with dividends reinvested or 27% without, which is roughly triple the historical average of the S&P 500 with dividends reinvested. That's a pretty stellar track record over a decade.
By comparison, Microsoft stock increased just 34% in the decade before then, which compared to a 55% gain in the S&P 500 as that decade included the crash during the financial crisis.
Nadella's record as Microsoft's CEO shows the power of a CEO to breathe new life into a company. The CEO is ultimately responsible for corporate strategy, capital allocation, and other key decisions, and a bad CEO like predecessor Steve Ballmer can be equally damaging.
Leadership could be especially important these days in the tech industry as the AI revolution takes off. Though each company competing in the generative AI race comes with a different set of strengths, the choices and investments that CEOs like Satya Nadella are making could make a difference in billions of profits over the long term.
Nadella has also succeeded in making Microsoft much more resilient than it was a decade ago thanks to the growth of its Azure cloud infrastructure business, the integration of its Office suite in Apple products, and acquisitions like LinkedIn and GitHub. That diversification also gives the company an advantage over its big tech rivals as it can deploy new generative AI across a wide range of products.
Microsoft stock jumped more than 50% in 2023, and its valuation has gotten a bit expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of 36.
However, Microsoft executed effectively in 2023, and it strengthened its competitive advantages by incorporating its new AI Copilot into a wide range of products, including its office productivity software.
Demand for those products should continue to ramp up in 2024, and Microsoft investors are in good hands with Nadella -- especially as the company continues to leverage its partnership with OpenAI, which also gives it an edge in AI.
Although the stock might be pricey, Microsoft's stock still looks like a smart buy in 2024.

The European Commission concluded that the collaboration does not constitute a takeover, and Microsoft does not exercise control over OpenAI’s operations.
The decision follows scrutiny sparked by revelations of Microsoft’s close relationship with the ChatGPT developer, leading to a review under the EU’s merger regulation, Bloomberg cites familiar sources.

However, the EU typically only approves most deals with unresolved competition issues.
Microsoft referenced a previous statement emphasizing that the partnership with OpenAI promotes innovation and competition while maintaining both companies’ independence.
The Commission’s spokesperson highlighted that to address any competition concern, a permanent change of control between the companies needs to be established.
The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is scrutinizing Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI and may investigate their collaboration for potential competition issues.
Microsoft is in talks with the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) to resolve a complaint filed with the European Union about the tech giant’s cloud computing licensing practices.
The complaint, launched in late 2022 by CISPE, which includes Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and 26 smaller EU cloud providers, charges Microsoft with contractual conditions that negatively affect Europe’s cloud computing market.
Over the last decade, Microsoft has incurred €1.6 billion in EU antitrust fines.
Microsoft stock gained over 42% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via SPDR Select Sector Fund – Technology (NYSE:XLK) and Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF (NYSE:FTEC).
Price Action: Microsoft shares traded lower by 0.73% at $411.55 on the last check Wednesday.

51,2024-06-26 14:33:00+00:00,"Microsoft (MSFT) Faces Charges by EU for Bundling Teams, Office",  Zacks Equity Research ,"Microsoft MSFT has been accused of breaching antitrust rules with the “abusive” bundling of its Teams and Office products by the European Union (EU) regulators.In a preliminary finding, EU officials stated that Microsoft has breached the bloc's competition rules by bundling Teams with its popular Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites for businesses.The potential consequences for Microsoft are significant, with the company facing a possible fine of up to 10% of its global annual revenues, a staggering amount of $211.9 billion in revenues reported for fiscal 2023.The investigation, initiated nearly a year ago, stems from a 2020 complaint by Slack, now owned by Salesforce CRM. Slack alleged that Microsoft's practice of automatically including Teams with its Office software suite gave the communication tool an unfair advantage, stifling competition in the market for remote communication and collaboration tools.The European Commission's preliminary findings suggest that Microsoft's practices may have restricted customer choice and hindered innovation. Specifically, the EU body is concerned that Microsoft has been forcing customers to acquire Teams by automatically bundling it with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites since at least April 2019. Furthermore, the Commission believes that interoperability limitations between Teams' competitors and Microsoft's offerings may have exacerbated the situation.In response to earlier concerns, Microsoft had already taken steps to unbundle Teams from its productivity suites in Europe and globally. (Read More: Microsoft Splits Teams and Office to Counter EU Scrutiny)However, the Commission deemed these changes insufficient, stating that ""more changes to Microsoft's conduct are necessary to restore competition."" As the investigation proceeds, the outcome could have far-reaching implications for how software suites are packaged and sold in Europe, potentially affecting millions of users and reshaping the competitive landscape in the business productivity software market.

This case highlights the EU's ongoing efforts to regulate major technology companies, with recent actions against Microsoft, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google, highlighting the bloc's determination to ensure fair competition in the digital marketplace.Shares of Microsoft have gained 19% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Apple and Alphabet’s growth of 22.4%, 28.4% and 8.1%, respectively. These cases underscore the growing tension between the EU's regulatory ambitions and the business practices of dominant platform providers.Simultaneously, Apple finds itself grappling with multiple regulatory challenges in the EU. The company faces its first charges under the bloc's new Digital Markets Act (DMA), accused of preventing app developers from directing users to cheaper options outside the App Store. This action strikes at the heart of Apple's tightly controlled ecosystem and could have far-reaching implications for its business model.Google is also facing increased scrutiny from EU regulators. The company is under investigation for potentially non-compliant measures related to the DMA's provisions against self-preferencing. The European Commission has expressed concerns that Google's current practices may not treat third-party services fairly in search results, a core issue in the ongoing debate about the power of dominant search engines.Furthermore, the European Commission has launched a new investigation into Apple's support for alternative iOS marketplaces, including the company's controversial core technology fee for developers. In response to these regulatory pressures, AAPL has taken the drastic step of announcing the blockage of certain features, including Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing, for EU users, citing security concerns related to DMA compliance.For Microsoft, the outcome of this investigation could have far-reaching consequences. If found in violation of EU antitrust rules, the company not only faces potential financial penalties but may also be forced to make significant changes to its product strategy and distribution model in Europe.Looking ahead, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company will need to carefully navigate its product development and marketing strategies to align with evolving regulatory expectations, not just in Europe but potentially worldwide.

54,2024-10-07 22:15:06+00:00,Nvidia Overtakes Microsoft as World's Second-Largest Company by Market Cap,  Andrew Kessel ,"Nvidia's market capitalization overtook Microsoft's on Monday, making it the second-largest company in the world behind Apple.
The semiconductor company and its partners are seeing robust demand for products to support artificial intelligence (AI).
Analysts suggested Nvidia shares could still climb higher, given the strength of AI spending and seasonal tailwinds.
Nvidia's (NVDA)market capitalization overtook Microsoft's (MSFT) on Monday, making it the second-largest company in the world behind Apple (AAPL).
Nvidia shares climbed just over 2% Monday, lifting the chipmaker's market cap to $3.13 trillion, ahead of Microsoft's $3.04 trillion. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a partner of Nvidia, reported strong shipments of its GPUs driven by artificial intelligence (AI) demand, helping send shares of both companies higher.
Nvidia and Microsoft have been jockeying with Apple for the top spot by market cap in recent months. In June, Nvidia briefly took the crown when it surpassed Microsoft, but Microsoft later reclaimed the title, and Apple has since pulled ahead.
Nvidia's stock price has more than doubled in value since the start of the year, as demand for its AI chips surged. Analysts suggested Nvidia shares could still climb higher, given the strength of AI spending trends and seasonal tailwinds.
Semiconductor companies typically perform better in the fourth quarter than they do in the third quarter, with Nvidia “still set to lead,"" Melius Research analysts said Monday, adding ""the setup here is still pretty darn good.""
Melius holds a price target of $165 for Nvidia, a 29% premium on Monday's closing price of $127.72. That compares to an average price target of $152.52, according to Visible Alpha.

55,2024-09-26 15:48:45+00:00,"Microsoft to make $2.7 billion cloud, AI investments in Brazil",Reuters ,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT)on Thursday pledged to invest 14.7 billion reais ($2.70 billion) in Brazil over three years to enhance its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence (AI) in Latin America's largest economy.
WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
The amount is the largest-ever investment to be announced at once in Brazil by Microsoft, which said massive adoption of AI could add as much as 4.2 percentage points to Brazil's economic growth by the end of the decade.
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT
The investments are part of the broader ""Microsoft Mais Brasil"" program disclosed by the U.S. tech giant in 2020 to reinforce its long-term commitment to the South American nation.
The company said it will expand its cloud and AI infrastructure in several datacenters in Sao Paulo state and offer AI training to some 5 million people over the next three years.
KEY QUOTES
""We are committed to supporting the AI ​​transformation in Brazil and ensuring it benefits everyone,"" Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said.
Brazilian Vice President Geraldo Alckmin said the investment proves the country can be a global AI protagonist, and emphasized the renewable energy supply available in Brazil to power datacenters.

56,2024-03-08 13:00:01+00:00,Microsoft's Strategic Stake in OpenAI Unlocks Unique Investment Avenues,  Hammad Sadiq ,"In the dynamic landscape of artificial intelligence, OpenAI has made a name for itself as an innovator, particularly with ChatGPT. This AI chatbot, together with other tools like Dall-E and an easy to use API, has done more than just demonstrate OpenAI's technical know-how, but also its ambition to create artificial general intelligence. Within 12 months, the value of the annualized revenue of OpenAI reached $2 billion by December 2023, with demand from business customers increasing significantly and the projections for 2025 showing this figure is set to more than double. Despite OpenAI's many accomplishments, though, its private nature is a challenge for investors wishing to be part of its expansion. There are no openly traded shares to buy, and so a direct investment is not an option for the general public. This is where software giant Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a visionary stake in OpenAI through its funding, comes in.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.
Microsoft's strategic partnership and investment in OpenAI indicates it is the company that will be at the forefront of the AI revolution and makes an interesting investment opportunity. The company began with a $1 billion investment in 2019, followed by an additional $10 billion and, as such, now holds a 49% ownership stake and rights to up to 75% of profits until the time it receives back its investment. The collaboration enables the incorporation of OpenAI technologies into all Microsoft products, which thus far has led to a substantial upsurge in sales.
The financial performance of Microsoft shows the technology giant is not only surviving, but also benefiting from the AI revolution. With the reported increase in revenue to $62 billion in the latest quarter, which represents 18% year-over-year growth, and cloud revenue surging by 24%, Microsoft exhibits a strong financial health and an aggressive pursuit of market share, mainly in the cloud sector.
The successful acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, which closed in October 2023, has lifted Microsoft's gaming division and is expected to generate additional revenues, besides giving it a stronger footing in the market. Activision will give the company a strong standing in the mobile gaming segment in which historically it was lagging behind. This step not only provides Microsoft with various revenue sources, but also strengthens its competitiveness in a market worth over $250 billion. As a result of this acquisition, the company is expected to grow its top line by 4.10% ($8.84 billion) in the coming year.
The rapidly growing cloud infrastructure market, which reached over $68 billion worldwide (up 18 % from the previous year), has undergone some dramatic changes. Such growth points to the fifth straight quarter of significant expansion and signifies the sturdy and continuing growth of the cloud sector. Inside this flourishing market, Microsoft Azure has shown remarkable growth and the market share has increased by approximately one point to 23%. This is in contrast to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, which has consistently remained about 33%, and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Cloud, which has retained its place at 11%. The amounts in terms of revenue are as follows: about $15.6 billion for Microsoft, $22.4 billion for Amazon and $7.4 billion for Google.
It is worth noting competitors are maintaining their market share, which is happening across the board with the revenue pie becoming bigger, meaning even stability translates into significant growth of the overall market. The fact Microsoft's market share increased by 1% to reach 23%, mainly in the period of such growth, shows it is the most bullish of the giants in the tech industry. A key factor of this success has been the company's strategic vision to implement generative AI technologies with the support of its multibillion-dollar investments in OpenAI. Microsoft Azure's incorporation of generative AI in its suite of day-to-day software products is not only riding the wave of cloud infrastructure expansion, but is also designing the future of how businesses and individuals interact with cloud services and AI technologies.
The expected decrease in inflation from 3% to 2.50% this year, as well as a lower probability of a recession, point to a very favorable macroeconomic background for Microsoft. Along with the strategic AI investments and the growth of the cloud infrastructure, the company, in my opinion, is well-positioned for continued growth.
In the coming months, the company is set to launch the Copilot chatbot for its Office 365 platform, which already has a significant user base of 345 million paid subscribers. Microsoft will offer the Copilot subscription for an extra $30 per month in addition to the existing fees. By assuming that 100 million users will subscribe, the company could see its annual revenue growth by at least $36 billion. This increase will represent an approximate 17% growth from the current annual revenue figures of $212 billion.
Microsoft has been beefing up its expenses, particularly with its cloud, AI and gaming platforms, but managed to expand its operating margin to 490 basis points on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2024, registering 43.60%. In view of this, the operating margin for the full year is expected to expand from 42.30% in 2023 to 43.70%, which will directly improve the bottom line.
Investors still have to pay attention to the issues of regulations and the related security risks. The AI market is dependent on ongoing demand, which is also influenced by technological advances, so investors need to balance opportunity with unpredictability. Microsoft's stock is not a bargain selling at forward price-earnings ratio of 35. In comparison, Alphabet, which is expected to achieve a similar rate of growth in earnings per share over the next three years, trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 21. The higher valuation of Microsoft could limit its upside potential if Azure's growth suddenly declines.All in all, I think Microsoft is a company that shares its values with me personally and that is why I am sure of buying the stock. It is not just doing its best, but has grown its business and seems to be getting ahead of the competition in the cloud and AI sectors. The stock could experience some ups and downs in the short term, but should surge over the next couple of years.

Analyst Timothy Horan lowered his view to perform from outperform and warned that investors were too optimistic about the potential of artificial intelligence to act as a near-term tailwind for the stock.
“The Street is likely overestimating near-term AI revenues as enterprise adoption and infrastructure remains a bottleneck,” Horan wrote in a note to clients. “Enterprises have been slow to adopt AI and associated revenues will likely disappoint.”
Losses at OpenAI, which Microsoft has invested in, are a “primary concern,” he said. Those losses “could be in the $2-3B range in FY25, which we were not previously modeling.”
Shares fell 0.4% in premarket trading. A lower close would represent a sixth straight negative session, the longest losing streak in more than a year. The stock — as of its last close — has declined 12% from its July peak, trading below key moving averages.
Investors have cited “AI fatigue” and the stock’s high multiple as factors behind the recent underperformance. It remains up 8.9% this year, below the Nasdaq 100 Index’s 18% rise, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Microsoft shares trade near 30 times estimated earnings, below a recent peak of 35 times, but still above its 10-year average. The Nasdaq 100 has a multiple of 25.5 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The downgrade is the latest example of how — at the margins — Wall Street is taking a more skeptical view toward big tech. Amazon.com Inc. on Monday received rare downgrade of its own, with Wells Fargo Securities cautioning on margin trends.
In addition, analyst Edison Lee assumed coverage of Apple Inc. at Jefferies and moved the rating to a hold from buy, citing overly optimistic expectations for the company’s latest iPhones, the first to come with artificial-intelligence tools.
Oppenheimer’s downgrade follows a move by D.A. Davidson, which cut its view on Microsoft in late September.
“Competition has largely caught up with Microsoft on the AI front, which reduces the justification for the current premium valuation,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria wrote in a note to clients, pointing to cloud rivals Alphabet Inc. and Amazon. A diminished lead in AI “will make it hard for MSFT to continue to outperform,” Luria said.
But, even with the downgrades, Wall Street remains overwhelmingly positive on Microsoft’s stock, and on big tech in general. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying Microsoft shares, while none have the equivalent of a sell rating. The average analyst price target points to upside of more than 20% over the coming 12 months.
Similar ratios are seen across other megacap names. The percentage of buy ratings on Amazon, Nvidia Corp., and Meta Platforms Inc. make up nearly or more than 90% of analyst ratings, while in Alphabet’s case, buy recommendations represent more than 80% of ratings. Apple however is an outlier, as only 65% of analysts recommend buying the stock.

60,2024-02-09 13:30:04+00:00,"If You Invested $1000 in Microsoft a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",  Zacks Equity Research ,"For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.
Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.
What if you'd invested in Microsoft (MSFT) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MSFT for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?
Microsoft's Business In-Depth
With that in mind, let's take a look at Microsoft's main business drivers.
Microsoft Corporation is one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world. The company dominates the PC software market with more than 73% of the market share for desktop operating systems.The company’s Microsoft 365 application suite is one of the most popular productivity software globally. It is also one of the prominent public cloud providers that can deliver a wide variety of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions at scale.Redmond, WA-based Microsoft’s products include operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools and video games. Its software solutions and hardware devices are playing an important role in developing the metaverse.The company designs and sells PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. Through Azure, it offers cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms and content.Microsoft reported revenues of $211.9 billion in fiscal 2023. The company reports operations under three segments: Productivity & Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing.Productivity & Business Processes accounted for 32.6% of fiscal 2023 revenues. The segment offers productivity and collaboration tools and services including Office 365, Dynamics business solutions, Teams, Relationship Sales solution, Power Platform and LinkedIn.Intelligent Cloud, which include Azure cloud services, contributed to 41.4% of fiscal 2023 revenues.In Jan, 2022, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard. The acquisition will accelerate the growth in Microsoft’s gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud gaming. Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have jointly agreed to extend the merger agreement through Oct 18, 2023 to allow for additional time to resolve remaining regulatory concerns.More Personal Computing represented 25.8% of fiscal 2023 revenues. The segment comprises mainly the Windows, Gaming (Xbox hardware and Xbox software and services), Devices (Surface, PC accessories, and other intelligent devices) and Search (Bing and Microsoft Advertising) businesses.
Bottom Line
Anyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Microsoft a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.
A $1000 investment made in February 2014 would be worth $11,326.86, or a gain of 1,032.69%, as of February 9, 2024, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.
Compare this to the S&P 500's rally of 178.12% and gold's return of 54.15% over the same time frame.
Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for MSFT.
Microsoft’s second-quarter results gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise. However, Office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.
Shares have gained 7.66% over the past four weeks and there have been 15 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.

61,2024-10-01 14:02:24+00:00,"Microsoft revamps AI Copilot with new voice, reasoning capabilities",  Jeffrey Dastin ,"By Jeffrey Dastin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft has given its consumer Copilot, an artificial intelligence assistant, a more amiable voice in its latest update, with the chatbot also capable of analyzing web pages for interested users as they browse.
The U.S. software maker now has ""an entire army"" of creative directors - among them psychologists, novelists and comedians - finessing the tone and style of Copilot to distinguish it, Mustafa Suleyman, chief executive of Microsoft AI, told Reuters in an interview.
In one demonstration of the updated Copilot, a consumer asked what housewarming gift to buy at a grocery store for a friend who did not drink wine. After some back-and-forth, Copilot said aloud: ""Italian (olive) oils are the hot stuff right now. Tuscan's my go-to. Super peppery.""
The feature rollout, starting Tuesday, is one of the first that Suleyman has overseen since Microsoft created his division in March to focus on consumer products and technology research.
Long identified with business software, Microsoft has had a much harder road in the consumer realm. Its Bing search engine, for instance, is still dwarfed by Google.
Suleyman is hoping for a bigger splash with Copilot, which launched last year in a crowded field of AI chatbots, including OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.
Copilot's newly fashioned voice capabilities make it seem much more of an active listener, giving verbal cues like ""cool"" and ""huh,"" Suleyman said.
Underlying the product are Microsoft AI, or ""MAI,"" models, plus a technology suite from partner OpenAI, Suleyman said.
Suleyman added that consumers who spend $20 monthly for Copilot Pro can start testing a ""Think Deeper"" feature that reasons through choices, like whether to move to one city or another.
He said an additional test feature for paying subscribers, Copilot Vision, amounts to ""digital pointing"" - the ability for users to talk to AI about what they see in a Microsoft Edge browser. Consumers have to opt in, and the content they view will not be saved or used to train AI, Microsoft said.
These updates represent ""glimmers"" of AI that can be an ""ever-present confidant, in your corner,"" Suleyman said. It's a vision he articulated as CEO of Inflection AI, whose top talent Microsoft poached in a closely watched deal this year.
Suleyman said that eventually, Copilot will learn context from consumers' Word documents, Windows desktops, even their gaming consoles if they grant permission.
Asked what Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, thinks of the company's AI efforts, Suleyman said Gates was excited.
""He's always asking me about when Copilot can read and parse his emails. It's one of his favorite ones,"" Suleyman said. ""We're on the case.""

62,2024-03-07 10:40:00+00:00,"This 1 Chart Shows How Microsoft Became the Biggest ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock and World's Most Valuable Company","  Keith Noonan, The Motley Fool ","Earlier this year, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) dethroned Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) to become the world's most valuable company. With a market capitalization of roughly $3 trillion, Microsoft is currently worth about $400 billion more than the iPhone manufacturer and stands atop the illustrious list of ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks.
Following Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) lead, Microsoft began building its own cloud infrastructure business in 2008. In 2010, the company launched its Azure cloud platform. But Azure wasn't really in a state that would allow it to be a credible competitor to Amazon Web Services (AWS) until 2013.
Coinciding with the appointment of Satya Nadella as CEO in 2014, Microsoft reorganized and reclassified its business segments. The company also began placing a much bigger emphasis on cloud and subscription-based businesses. While this shift helped drive substantial sales and margin growth for its productivity-and-business-processes segment, the company's intelligent cloud segment and the Azure unit within that segment have been even bigger performance drivers.
As the chart shows, intelligent cloud revenue has grown at a rapid pace -- and the segment is now Microsoft's biggest overall sales driver. For the company's 2023 fiscal year (ended June 30, 2023), the segment generated sales of $87.9 billion and accounted for roughly 41.5% of the business's $211.9 billion in total sales. The division also accounted for roughly 43% of the $88.5 billion in operating income that Microsoft posted that fiscal year.
Strong performance for the Azure unit and overall intelligent cloud segment has continued in the current fiscal year and helped Microsoft become the world's most valuable company. While AWS remains the overall market leader in cloud infrastructure services, Azure continues to gain market share and it sees strong demand tailwinds in conjunction with the rise of artificial intelligence.
Even though Apple continues to generate more revenue than Microsoft, the more software-focused nature of Microsoft's business helps it have lower costs and achieve superior margins. Thanks to rapid growth and strong profits from the intelligent cloud segment, the software giant tops the list of the world's most valuable companies.

63,2024-09-18 17:59:46+00:00,Analyst Sees Upside in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Rate Cuts,  Attiya Zainib ,"We recently published a list of 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. Since Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.
While everyone is talking about rate cuts, some analysts are questioning whether it was necessary even to start cutting rates at this time. Latest data released on Tuesday showed retail sales in the US rose while Wall Street analysts were expecting to see a decline. Oksana Aronov, JPMorgan Asset Management head of market strategy for alternative fixed income, said while talking to CNBC that rate cuts are not even warranted as she thinks there are no signs of broader weakening except for the labor market.
Aronov said cutting rates would “loosen” the financial conditions further. The analyst said that about 14 months ago, everyone was looking at the CPI that was clocking in at 3% and expected the metric to fall to 2%. But even after all these months, CPI year over year is at 2.9%. She said that the Fed should move carefully and the 2% inflation target would be “elusive” because fiscal spending will continue to rise.
AI investors are however looking beyond this debate and already positioning to pile into more growth stocks amid the beginning of the rate-cut cycle.
For this article, we picked 10 buzzing AI stocks and discussed the latest news around them.
With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 279
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a latest note that tech stocks tied to AI can move higher amid rate cuts.
“In a nutshell we believe the stage is set for tech stocks to move higher into year-end and 2025 in our opinion as the Fed and Powell kick off its rate cutting cycle this week, macro soft landing remains the path, and tech spending on AI remains a generational spending cycle just starting to hit the shores of the tech sector,” Ives said. The analyst mentioned MSFT as one of the stocks that can benefit from rate cuts.
In a separate note, Ives recently talked about his bullish thesis on MSFT.
Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the top stocks Ives believes can benefit from the AI wave.
“While investors may fret about this massive spending wave and frustrated that top-line growth/margins from these investments could take time to materialize, this ultimately speaks to our view this is a 1995 (almost 1996) start of the Internet Moment, and not a 1999 Tech Bubble-like moment despite bears getting louder during some of these head for the elevators tech sell-offs,” Ives added.
Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently fell following its latest quarterly results which showed the company’s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.
But what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office’s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year’s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year’s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year’s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.
While Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and would bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year’s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.
Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft’s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure’s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.”
Overall, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

64,2024-04-22 14:09:25+00:00,Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Says 'OpenAI Wouldn't Have Existed' Without Microsoft's Support,  Caleb Naysmith ,"Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella emphasized the pivotal role the company played in the growth of leading artificial intelligence company OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence company, during a recent interview posted on YouTube
""OpenAI wouldn’t have existed but for our early support. Today, they are an incredible company, and we are thrilled to be a part of their journey,"" Nadella said.

Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019, followed by an additional $10 billion in 2021. Despite these substantial financial contributions, Microsoft does not hold any ownership in OpenAI. Instead, it is entitled to a share of profits, limited to a certain amount, from a specific OpenAI subsidiary.
“While details of our agreement remain confidential, it is important to note that Microsoft does not own any portion of OpenAI. We are simply entitled to a share of profit distributions,” Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw said in December.
“Microsoft, employees and investors hold an economic interest in the for-profit subsidiary, which entitles them to a share of the profits,” a source familiar with the arrangement told the Financial Times.

Other investors in OpenAI include Khosla Ventures and the Reid Hoffman Foundation.
In addition to his comments about OpenAI, Nadella discussed the broader artificial intelligence (AI) landscape, noting the healthy competition among major tech firms. He believes this competition is beneficial, creating significant opportunities for global advancement.
""One of the things that I think is understated is competition amongst big Tech players. I think it’s very healthy when you have all of the folks competing with each other, that means it’s creating a real opportunity for the world to benefit. Whenever anyone gets excited about the existing incumbents, you have to watch out for new entrants,"" Nadella said.
This highlights the fact that even Microsoft is watching for the latest innovative startup looking to disrupt an industry.
Microsoft, which is committed to advancing AI and cloud infrastructure globally, also has invested in other AI companies such as Figure AI, Mistral AI and Vengo AI. Last week, the company announced plans to invest $2.9 billion in AI and cloud infrastructure in Japan.
“As digital activities increase, it is crucial for the Japanese industry to collaborate with global companies like Microsoft, equipped with robust digital infrastructure,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said.
The investment in Japan follows Microsoft's previous commitments of $3.2 billion in the U.K., $3.5 billion in Germany and $2.1 billion in Spain, highlighting its continuous investment in technology across various regions.

65,2024-09-17 22:31:29+00:00,Which Tech Stock Is Better: Apple or Microsoft?,  TipRanks ,"In this article, I evaluate two leading technology stocks, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), to determine which is the better investment. In preview, I have a neutral view of Apple and a bullish outlook on Microsoft.
Apple is known for its popular consumer electronics such as the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and MacBook computer. The company also provides digital content via its App Store, Apple TV, and the Apple Card payment service. Microsoft is known for the Windows personal computer (PC) operating system, its Office 365 software suite, the Xbox video game console, and its Azure cloud computing platform.
AAPL stock has risen 13% year-to-date and is up 22% over the last year. Microsoft’s share price has gained 15% year-to-date and is up 32% over the past 12 months. These share price performances make Apple and Microsoft the laggards of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” technology stocks, with only Tesla (TSLA) performing worse. AAPL and MSFT stocks have also underperformed the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite index that is up nearly 20% this year.
The valuation of Apple stock has a lot to do with my neutral view. Currently, AAPL is trading at 32 times future earnings estimates, which is less than the average price/earnings ratio of 44 among technology stocks. MSFT is also trading at a higher multiple of 36 times future earnings expectations. Additionally, Apple’s stock has been largely trading sideways since June of this year. Because of this, a neutral view of the stock seems appropriate.
There are also concerns about iPhone sales to consider. When the company launched the iPhone 16 earlier in September, AAPL stock jumped. However, there have been reports about weak sales immediately following the newest iPhone’s public unveiling. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that iPhone 16 demand is weak, dropping 12% compared to last year’s iPhone 15 launch.
Kuo and other analysts have also expressed disappointment with the lack of new features on the iPhone 16. One of the most anticipated features, the company’s AI application known as “Apple Intelligence,” won’t launch until October of this year and is only in a beta format. Of course, Apple remains a strong company overall, and the current iPhone slump is likely temporary. However, patient investors might be able to buy the stock at a more attractive share price in the coming weeks if iPhone 16 sales disappoint.
Apple has a consensus rating of Moderate Buy among 32 Wall Street analysts. There are currently 23 Buy ratings, eight Hold ratings, and one Sell recommendation assigned to the stock. At $249.46, the average Apple stock price target implies upside potential of 15.39%.
Read more analyst ratings on AAPL stock
There are many reasons to be bullish on MSFT stock. Like Apple, Microsoft is trading at a discount to the technology sector. Microsoft’s stock has been in decline in recent months, falling 7% since early July. Some of that decline has been reversed on news that the company is raising its dividend by 10% and has approved a new $60 billion stock buyback program, boosting shareholder returns in the process. The company raised its dividend from $0.75 to $0.83 per share, payable on Dec. 12 of this year.
Microsoft also continues to be a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, capturing market share in both fast-growing segments. Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform continues to grow at a brisk clip and is more all-encompassing than Apple’s upcoming AI features for the iPhone.
Microsoft has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on the views of 30 Wall Street analysts. This is comprised of 29 Buy and one Hold rating on the company’s stock. No Sell ratings have been assigned over the last three months. At $501.15, the average price target on Microsoft stock implies upside potential of 16.16%.
Read more analyst ratings on MSFT stock
Apple and Microsoft could be long-term additions to any portfolio. However, Microsoft is preferred based on the company’s leadership role in AI and future growth potential. The fact that the company raised its dividend payout to shareholders and initiated a $60 billion share repurchase program are other reasons to like MSFT stock. Apple, on the other hand, is struggling with weak iPhone demand and to clarify its AI strategy. As such, I remain bullish on MSFT stock and neutral on AAPL stock.

66,2024-07-23 18:00:21+00:00,I Got Rich Off Microsoft: Here Are 5 Companies You Should Invest in Now,  Sean Bryant ,"In 2023, Microsoft celebrated the 40th birthday of Microsoft Windows. Not long after that launch, they decided to become a publicly traded company. Even though the company has had a few ups and downs, many people have become quite wealthy because of its success.

“Back in 2015, I saw potential in Microsoft’s cloud strategy and invested when their stock was around $40,” says John Pennypacke, VP, Sales & Marketing at Deep Cognition. “Yes, that decision has paid off handsomely, with my investment growing over 600% since then. Microsoft’s pivot to cloud computing and its grip on the enterprise software market really drove this success.”
It’s no secret that Microsoft has been extremely profitable for investors recently. A significant part of that success has been due to its AI and cloud products. Its most recent quarterly earnings reported a profit of $12.51 billion, a 32% year-over-year (YoY) growth for the intelligent cloud unit.
Based on Microsoft’s success for investors, we wanted to find out what other companies people should be optimistic about.
Also here’s ten other companies best to invest in right now.
Like Microsoft, Nvidia has been on a tear over the past year. Year to date (YTD), the stock is up 144%, and its one-year return is at 164%. Much of the recent success has been powered by its push into generative AI.

“At Deep Cognition, Nvidia’s GPUs power our AI development,” says Pennypacke. “Their lead in AI and graphics processing sets them up to ride the wave of growing AI applications across industries. I’ve seen up close how their tech keeps pushing the boundaries of what we can do in AI.”
Even though some will tell you the AI and Nvidia run is starting to lose steam, others think there is still plenty of room for it. It’s also important to remember that Nvidia was an important company before AI came into the picture. It helps run laptops, video game consoles, cloud platforms, self-driving technology, and more.

Sketchers, a designer and developer of casual footwear for men, women, and children, is another company to watch out for. YTD, they’ve had a modest gain of 2%, but their stock price is up more than 19% over the past year.

“We like SKX’s (Sketchers) attractive projected double digit growth in both revenue and earnings, which the market currently prices at a very reasonable Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E) of 13.1x (2025),” says Ulrich Ebensperger, Founder and CEO of Ziggma.
Sketchers will report their latest earnings on July 25, and the consensus is that quarterly sales growth will be roughly 10% to $2.21 billion. This comes after they announced quarterly revenue of $2.25 billion in the previous quarter, up 12.5%.
Many people think of Amazon as one of the biggest retailers of consumer products. While that’s true, Amazon’s revenue is much more complex.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s largest cloud services business, with more than $100 billion in annual revenue. Similar to Nvidia, much of its recent growth has come from AI. They offer businesses everything from chips to customized language models.
“While their e-commerce platform is everywhere, it’s AWS that gets me excited as a tech leader,” says Pennypacke. “We lean heavily on AWS, and I’ve watched it become a must-have for businesses big and small. Their moves into healthcare and advertising also look promising for future growth.”
Amazon isn’t the cheapest stock, with a P/E ratio of 40.1X, but its ability to continue to generate sustainable growth from its different business units should be exciting for investors.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, social media websites like Pinterest were on fire. With people stuck inside their homes, they turned to social media to occupy their time. Unfortunately, once restrictions ended and people started venturing outside again, social media usage declined. For companies like Pinterest, this significantly impacted the stock price.
However, with significant improvements made to the platform, including better search functionality and videos, Pinterest is once again starting to soar. They recently announced that their monthly active users were up 12% YoY to 518 million people, an all-time high.
Pinterest is also benefiting from the input of activist investor Elliot Advisors, who has been very vocal about the strategic changes needed within the company.
“We like PINS because famous activist investor Elliott Advisors has identified a number of ways to drive shareholder value through growth and profitability initiatives,” says Ebensperger. “Elliott is hard at work pushing the Board to implement these initiatives after having obtained a Board seat.”
Taiwan Semiconductor recently reported a blowout quarter, with revenue up 33% to $20.8 billion. 52% of this revenue was due to chips being used for AI.
One of the biggest unknowns for a company like Taiwan Semiconductor is what the impacts of a Trump victory in November might mean. While most production is outside the United States, they are building a complex in Phoenix, Arizona. The first part should be ready in 2025, and the next two by the decade’s end. Its ability to manufacture inside the United States could greatly impact its profitability. However, even with these unknowns, the projected full-year revenue growth is 21%.
“As we cook up cutting-edge AI solutions, we know how vital advanced semiconductors are,” says Pennypacke. “Taiwan Semiconductor’s manufacturing chops make them a key player in the tech supply chain, and they’ll only become more important as demand for advanced chips in AI, 5G, and IoT keeps climbing.”

67,2024-09-27 07:16:28+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Why Are Billionaires Bullish on This Stock Right Now?,  Sheryar Siddiq ,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks To Invest In According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other billionaire-approved stocks.
Billionaires and top hedge fund managers typically dominate the stock market, focusing on leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. They usually don’t waste time with underperformers—they target the market's elite.
Before diving into the top stock picks among billionaires, reviewing how the market has performed so far this year is essential. On September 18, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, lowering it to 4.75%–5.00% from 5.25%–5.50%. This move fueled a market rally, pushing stocks to a new intraday record high, and marking the 39th all-time high of 2024—the first since mid-July. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari acknowledged that while the rate cut was unusual historically, shifting the policy focus from controlling high inflation to addressing a weakening labor market was necessary. Here are some comments:
“Right now, we still have a strong, healthy labor market. But I want to keep it a strong, healthy labor market, and a lot of the recent inflation data is coming in looking very positive that we’re on our way back to 2%. So I don’t think you’re going to find anybody at the Federal Reserve who declares mission accomplished, but we are paying attention to what risks are most likely to materialize in the near future.”
Market expectations point to an equal probability of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cutting rates by either a quarter- or half-percentage point at its November meeting, with a higher chance of the larger reduction in December. Overall, markets are signaling the Fed’s intent to bring rates to a ""neutral"" level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth.
For nearly two years, bulls have dominated Wall Street, driven by a resilient U.S. economy and growing enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI). This momentum has propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to multiple record highs in 2024. Despite the surge, not everyone seems hopeful about the market, with some of the most influential billionaire investors, including Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, signaling caution. Buffett, known for his long-term optimism, has been a net seller of stocks for seven straight quarters.
On the other hand, billionaire investor Ray Dalio recently raised concerns about the ""enormous amount of debt"" burdening the U.S. economy. He cautions that neither former President Donald Trump nor Vice President Kamala Harris is likely to focus on addressing debt sustainability in the upcoming presidential election, suggesting that the pressure from the $35.3 trillion national debt will persist, regardless of the election outcome.

In fiscal Q4 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported $64.7 billion in revenue, a 15% increase year-over-year. Net income rose 10% YoY to $22 billion. A major driver of this growth is Microsoft Azure, which has benefitted from AI integrations. With a 31% market share, Azure is poised to generate substantial value amid strong demand for cloud solutions.
Mizuho recently reiterated its positive outlook on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), maintaining an Outperform rating and a price target of $480. The endorsement followed Microsoft's announcement of a new $60 billion share buyback program, matching the previous plan set three years ago. The company also raised its quarterly dividend by nearly 11%, continuing a six-year trend of dividend growth.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) tops the list of the 10 best stocks to buy, with 34 billionaires holding stakes in the company as of the June 2024 quarter.
Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft’s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure’s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.”
Overall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the stocks to invest in according to billionaires.

68,2024-07-08 14:21:37+00:00,"Microsoft Hack Also Impacted VA, Global Media Agency","  Charles Gorrivan, Jamie Tarabay and Evan Gorelick ","(Bloomberg) -- The US Department of Veterans Affairs and a US agency that provides news overseas are among a growing list of Microsoft Corp. customers that have acknowledged they were impacted by a breach of the technology giant that was blamed on Russian state-sponsored hackers.

The US Agency for Global Media, an independent federal agency that provides news and information in countries where the press is restricted, was notified “a couple months ago” by Microsoft that some of its data may have been stolen, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. No security or personally identifiable sensitive data was compromised, the spokesperson said.
The agency is working closely with the Department of Homeland Security on the incident, the spokesperson said, declining to answer additional questions.
Microsoft disclosed in January that a Russian hacking group it calls Midnight Blizzard had accessed corporate email accounts and later warned that they were attempting to use secrets shared between the technology giant and its customers. The company has declined to identify the customers who were impacted.
“As our investigation continues, we have been reaching out to customers to notify them if they had corresponded with a Microsoft corporate email account that was accessed,” a Microsoft spokesperson said on Wednesday. “We will continue to coordinate, support and assist our customers in taking mitigating measures.”
In addition, the Department of Veterans Affairs was notified in March that it was impacted the Microsoft breach, officials for the agency said.
The hackers used a single set of stolen credentials — found in the emails they accessed — to break into a test environment in the VA’s Microsoft Cloud account around January, the officials said, adding that the intrusion lasted for one second. Midnight Blizzard likely intended to check if the credentials were valid, presumably with the larger intention of breaching the VA’s network, the officials said.
The agency changed the exposed credentials, along with log-in details across their Microsoft environments, once they were notified of the intrusion, they said. After reviewing the emails that the hackers accessed, the VA determined that no additional credentials or sensitive email was taken, the officials said.
Terrence Hayes, the VA’s press secretary, said an investigation is continuing to determine any additional impact.
The Peace Corps was also contacted by Microsoft and notified about the Midnight Blizzard breach, according to a statement from its press office. “Based on this notification, Peace Corps technical staff were able to mitigate the vulnerability,” according to the agency. The Peace Corps declined further comment.
Bloomberg News asked other federal agencies for comment, and none of the others disclosed that they were impacted by Midnight Blizzard’s attack on Microsoft. Bloomberg previously reported that more than a dozen Texas state agencies and public universities were exposed by the Russian hack.
Midnight Blizzard, also known in secularity circles as “Cozy Bear” and “APT29,” is part of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, according to US and UK authorities.
In April, US federal agencies were ordered to analyze emails, reset compromise passwords and work to secure Microsoft cloud accounts amid fears that Midnight Blizzard may have accessed correspondence. Microsoft has been notifying some customers in the months since then that their emails with the tech giant were accessed by the Russian hackers.
The Midnight Blizzard breach was one in a series of high-profile and damaging security failures at the Redmond, Washington-based technology company, which has drawn strong condemnation by the US government. Microsoft President Brad Smith appeared before Congress last month where he acknowledged security failures and vowed to improve the company’s operations.

It's also the most valuable public company in the world at the moment at $3.4 trillion. In addition to providing cloud-computing services, market-leading operating systems, and productivity software, the technology giant is also at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
Strong earnings results and emerging opportunities in AI have helped power strong performance for the company's stock lately. The software giant's share price is up 34% over the last year alone.
Even more impressive, the stock has delivered a return of more than 1,160% since Satya Nadella became the company's CEO in February 2014. That means that if you invested $1,000 on the day Nadella took over on Feb. 4, 2014, your investment would now be worth more than $12,570.
With Microsoft on a winning streak, it might be easy to forget that the company was facing some major challenges at the time Nadella took over in the CEO role. Due to some failed projects and unproductive strategic directions, the company and its stock had a rocky start to the 2010s. But Microsoft managed to deliver an incredible turnaround.
Nadella spearheaded a pivot to a new strategy that focused on subscription services. The company shifted Office and other software away from being one-time licensing purchases and instead started selling them on a subscription basis. This made the company's sales more dependable and also helped boost margins.
He also oversaw the strategic prioritization and growth of the company's Azure cloud infrastructure services. Azure has grown at an incredible rate over the last decade, and it currently stands as the second-largest player by market share -- trailing behind only Amazon's AWS.
Microsoft's cloud business is generating strong sales, growing rapidly, and posting impressive profit margins. It's also helped the company tap into emerging AI-driven demand, and the best is likely still to come.

70,2024-03-29 21:14:58+00:00,"Microsoft, OpenAI plan $100 billion data-center project, media report says",Reuters ,"(Reuters) -Microsoft and OpenAI are working on plans for a data center project that could cost as much as $100 billion and include an artificial intelligence supercomputer called ""Stargate"" set to launch in 2028, The Information reported on Friday.
OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence technology has led to sky-rocketing demand for AI data centers capable of handling more advanced tasks than traditional data centers.
The Information reported that Microsoft would likely finance the project, which is expected to be 100 times more costly than some of the biggest existing data centers, citing people involved in private conversations about the proposal.
The proposed U.S.-based supercomputer would be the biggest in a series the companies are looking to build over the next six years, the report added.
The Information attributed the tentative cost of $100 billion to a person who spoke to Altman about it and a person who has viewed some of Microsoft's initial cost estimates. It did not identify those sources.
Altman and Microsoft have spread the supercomputers across five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase. Microsoft is working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI to be launched around 2026, according to the report.
Microsoft and OpenAI are in the middle of the third phase of the five-phase plan, with a significant portion of the cost for the next two phases involving acquiring the needed AI chips, the report said.
AI chips are often sold at high prices. Chip company Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC earlier in March that the latest ""Blackwell"" B200 artificial intelligence chip will be priced between $30,000 and $40,000.
Microsoft had also announced a duo of custom-designed computing chips in November last year.
The report said the new project would be designed to work with chips from different suppliers.
""We are always planning for the next generation of infrastructure innovations needed to continue pushing the frontier of AI capability,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Reuters. The spokesperson did not comment directly on the report about the planned launch of the Stargate supercomputer.
Expenses for the plan could exceed $115 billion, more than triple Microsoft's expenditure last year on capital spending for servers, buildings and other equipment, the report stated.

71,2024-04-10 14:00:02+00:00,Microsoft's Free Cash Flow Could Push Its Value Significantly Higher,"  Mark Hake, CFA ","Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) could be at least 20% undervalued despite the stock's recent rise. This is based on its free cash flow, which is powered by the company's focus on artificial intelligence products.
As of April 3, at $420.45 per share, the stock could be worth about 20% more at $504 over the next 12 months. This discussion will cover how this value can be seen by using a free cash flow margin analysis along with a FCF yield metric approach.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.
Moreover, Microsoft's upcoming release of its fiscal third-quarter results ending March 31 can show investors if it is on track to continue strong FCF growth.
But first, let's review why FCF growth is so important with a stock like Microsoft. Free cash flow is the amount of cash flow left over after all cash operating expenses, including capex spending and net changes in working capital, that is free to spend on dividends, buybacks, acquisitions and debt reduction.
For example, Microsoft closed on its $75 billion all-cash acquisition of Activision Blizzard in October 2023. The company would not have been able to finance this deal if it was not producing cash that was free of any need to cover its own cash spending needs.
This year Microsoft is likely to generate about $69.9 billion in FCF based on analyst revenue estimates and using the company's guidance on its capex spending. That works out close to 29% of its revenue, which is close to its historical averages. That can be seen in the chart below.
It shows that Microsoft has been making between 28% and 33% of its sales in FCF over the past several years.
The details of the FCF growth estimates will be discussed below. But first, let's review the company's focus on AI products.
Moreover, management has been benefiting from strong revenue growth based on its focus on artificial intelligence products. CEO Satya Nadella said in a Jan. 30 earnings call that We have moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale.
He says that the company has been infusing AI across every layer of the company's tech stack. For example, AI is now part of the Azure product lineup using Microsoft's close relationship with OpenAI. He said:
And we have great momentum with our Azure OpenAI Service. This quarter, we added support for OpenAI's latest models, including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 with Vision, Dall-E 3, as well as fine-tuning.
As a result, revenue rose 18% in its latest fiscal quarter (second-quarter 2024) ending Dec. 31, 2023. Moreover, for the six months ending Dec. 31, sales were up 15.2% year over year and for the trailing 12 months in the same period, they rose 11.5%.
This is leading to strong FCF growth as well.
For example, in the trailing 12-month periods in the last four quarters, Microsoft has shown strong FCF growth. This can be seen in the chart and table below.
This shows that in the past five quarters, as Microsoft has begun to focus on AI-driven products, its FCF margins have held up well. They have ranged from 28.1% to 29.6% on a trailing 12-month basis in the last four quarters.
This is despite higher spending on capital expenditures such as data centers to reap the benefits of generative AI products.
Moreover, based on estimates from a survey of 52 analysts, revenue for the year ending June 30, 2024 is forecast to rise by 15.2% from $211.9 billion last year to $244.3 billion.
And for the next year, these analysts forecast a rise of 14.3% in sales to $279.3 billion. As a result, using margin analysis it is possible to forecast the company's FCF going forward.
For example, look at the table below. We assume the company's capex spending will increase. This is what the CEO said in the Jan. 30 earnings call:
We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout.
As a result, we can expect that its capital expenditures as a percent of sales will increase from 13.30% last fiscal year to at least 16% this year.
The net result, despite this higher capex spending, is that FCF will still stay strong at $69.9 billion this year and $79.9 billion next year.
As a result, a price target for the stock can be set using these FCF figures.
One way to value a stock is to assume the company, assuming it generates positive FCF, was to pay out all of the FCF as a dividend. That way we can set a FCF yield metric for the stock.
In this case, Microsoft pays an annual dividend of $3 per share and there are now 7.43 billion shares outstanding. That means its dividend costs Microsoft $22.29 billion, or just 31.9% of its estimated $69.9 billion in FCF. That means if the company were to pay out 100%, it would increase the payments to shareholders by 3.10 times (i.e., 1.00/0.319 = 3.1347).
The market is presently giving the stock a 0.71 % dividend yield (i.e., $3.00/$420.45). So, theoretically, we should use an FCF yield that is 3.130 times this 0.71% dividend yield, or 2.22%.
That implies a good FCF yield metric is 2% since the stock is likely to have a lower yield with the higher dividend payment. This is also the same as multiplying the FCF estimates by 50 since the inverse of 2% is 50 (i.e., 1/0.020 = 50).
The table below shows how this works out.
Multiplying the 2024 $69.9 billion FCF estimate by 50 results in a market cap estimate of almost $3.5 trillion. And for 2025, the market cap forecast is almost $4 trillion. This implies that Microsoft's stock is worth, on average, 20% more at $3.75 trillion, or $504 per share.
The bottom line is that based on reasonable cash flow estimates and company guidance on its capex spending, Microsoft is set to produce a strong FCF result. This implies over the next 12 months it could be worth 20% more than today.

72,2024-06-03 21:55:59+00:00,"Microsoft to lay off hundreds at Azure cloud unit, Business Insider reports",Reuters ,"(Reuters) -Microsoft is cutting hundreds of jobs at its Azure cloud unit, Business Insider reported on Monday, adding to a flurry of layoffs seen in the technology and media industries this year.
The layoffs will impact teams including Azure for Operators and Mission Engineering, according to the report. The Azure for Operators layoffs involve as many as 1,500 job cuts, it added, citing people familiar with the situation.
""Organizational and workforce adjustments are a necessary and regular part of managing our business. We will continue to prioritize and invest in strategic growth areas for our future and in support of our customers and partners,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told Reuters.
The cuts come after the company shed 1,900 jobs at Activision Blizzard and Xbox in January this year. Tech firms including Amazon.com and Salesforce also laid off several hundred employees in 2024.
Microsoft's Azure cloud is witnessing sharp growth due to the company's heavy investment in AI and its access to the coveted technologies of ChatGPT maker OpenAI through their strategic partnership.
Azure for Operations and Mission Engineering are a part of an organization called Strategic Missions and Technologies formed in 2021 tasked with quantum computing and space, the Business Insider reported.
Separately, Microsoft has started restructuring its mixed reality organization but will continue to sell its augmented reality headset, the HoloLens 2, a spokesperson for the company told Reuters on Monday.
Business Insider reported in 2022 that the company scrapped plans for HoloLens 3.

Microsoft's performance in the fourth quarter of 2024 is expected to have shown robust growth, primarily driven by its Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segments. The company's strategic focus on cloud services, particularly Azure and the Office 365 suite, is likely to have contributed significantly to top-line growth.In the Intelligent Cloud segment, the company anticipates revenues between $28.4 billion and $28.7 billion. Our model estimate for this segment is pegged at $28.54 billion, indicating growth of 19% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. In Azure, Microsoft expects revenue growth in the range of 30-31% at cc. Microsoft's Azure platform is spearheading the company's AI-driven growth strategy.A key factor in Microsoft's growth strategy has been Teams, its enterprise communication platform. Teams has been expanding its customer base and feature set, effectively competing against rivals like Zoom. The platform's growth is closely tied to the rising popularity of hybrid and flexible work models. In the quarter under review, Microsoft announced that it is set to sell Teams separately from its Office product globally. The decision comes after the company unbundled the two products in Europe to avert a possible EU antitrust fine.Microsoft anticipates its Productivity and Business Processes segment to generate revenues between $19.9 billion and $20.2 billion. Our model estimate is pegged at $20.03 billion, indicating an increase of 9.5% year over year.This growth is underpinned by strong performance across various product lines. Office 365 Commercial is expected to see revenue growth of approximately 14% at constant currency (cc), which is in line with our model estimate. However, traditional Office Commercial products are projected to experience a decline in the mid-to-high teens range, highlighting the ongoing shift from on-premise to cloud-based solutions.The company's diversified portfolio continues to show promise, with Office Consumer products and cloud services expected to achieve revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digits. LinkedIn is projected to achieve mid-to-high single-digit growth. Our model estimate for LinkedIn is pegged at revenue growth of 6.6%.Dynamics 365, Microsoft's enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management platform, is another steady performer, with the company projecting revenue growth in the low-to-mid teens. For the More Personal Computing segment, the company projects revenues between $15.2 billion and $15.6 billion. Revenues from Windows are likely to have been driven by steady traction seen in Windows Commercial products and cloud services growth amid improving personal computer (PC) demand.The Traditional PC market delivered its second quarter of growth following eight consecutive quarters of decline. According to preliminary results from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Personal Computing Device Tracker, worldwide shipments reached 64.9 million units in the second quarter of 2024, representing year-over-year growth of 3%.Among other major PC vendors, Lenovo (LNVGY) and Hewlett Packard (HPE) registered an increase in shipments. Lenovo's shipments increased 3.7% year over year to 14.7 million units, while HPE's shipments grew 1.8% year over year to 13.7 million units. Additionally, Apple (AAPL) registered a 20.8% year-over-year improvement in shipments, reaching 5.7 million units.Microsoft expects Windows OEM revenues to grow in the mid to low-to-mid single-digit range. In the Gaming segment, MSFT expects revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including roughly 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Furthermore, Microsoft anticipates Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s, driven by roughly 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. In the quarter under review, Microsoft announced the renewal of a publishing agreement with NetEase, which will bring back Blizzard Entertainment's games like World of Warcraft to players in China.
Shares of MSFT have returned 17.8% year to date compared with the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 21.5%. Shares of HPE and AAPL have gained 21.3% and 16.3%, respectively, while shares of LNVGY have declined 2.8%.

Now, let’s look at the value Microsoft offers investors at current levels. MSFT is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 11.73X compared with the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s 8.13X and higher than the median of 10.05X, reflecting a stretched valuation.

Microsoft presents a strong investment case with its dominant position in cloud computing (Azure) and productivity software (Office 365), driving consistent revenue growth. The company's strategic focus on AI integration and partnerships, like with OpenAI, positions it at the forefront of technological innovation. Microsoft's diversified portfolio, including gaming (Xbox) and professional networking (LinkedIn), provides stability and multiple growth avenues. However, potential challenges include intense competition in the cloud market, particularly from Amazon and Google, and the cyclical nature of enterprise IT spending. Regulatory scrutiny over market dominance and data privacy concerns pose additional risks. Despite these challenges, Microsoft's strong balance sheet, consistent cash flow, and history of shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks make it an attractive option for investors seeking a balance of growth and stability in the tech sector.
Microsoft's strong performance in productivity and collaboration offerings is expected to drive substantial growth in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 despite a premium valuation and fierce competition in the cloud market. The company's strategic focus on cloud services, AI integration, and innovative product development has positioned it favorably in the competitive market. Maintaining a position in Microsoft appears prudent at present. Investors looking to buy the stock should, however, wait for a better entry point.

The association of Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe struck a deal with Microsoft on Wednesday that will see the lobby withdraw its complaint to the EU’s competition department, Microsoft said in a statement. CISPE had argued Microsoft made it too difficult for customers to change cloud providers by tying its business software to its Azure cloud services.
“After working with CISPE and its European members for more than a year, I am pleased that we’ve not only resolved their concerns of the past, but also worked together to define a path forward that brings even more competition to the cloud computing market in Europe and beyond,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said in the statement.
The agreement will allow CISPE members to use enhanced Microsoft Azure features, with service providers permitted to offer Microsoft applications and services on their local cloud infrastructures, the association said in a statement.
A European Commission spokesperson said it would assess the impact of the settlement on competition in European cloud markets.
The deal however was not offered to CISPE’s largest member, Amazon Web Services or to Google’s Cloud Platform and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s cloud service, CISPE said.
AWS said in a statement that the settlement “does nothing for the vast majority of Microsoft customers who are still unable to use the cloud of their choice in Europe and around the world.”
The agreement between Microsoft and CISPE puts an end to a long-running back-and-forth between the parties, that saw Microsoft make a spate of concessions in order to appease the concerns of cloud service providers. On the heels of those complaints, EU regulators had been informally asking market rivals and customers about Microsoft’s conduct.
“We are exploring our options to continue to fight against Microsoft’s anti-competitive licensing in order to promote choice, innovation, and the growth of the digital economy in Europe,” Amit Zavery, head of platform at Google Cloud, said.
Microsoft is no stranger to EU antitrust scrutiny and in previous decades fought a long battle with regulators over abuses linked to the market dominance of Windows.
More recently, its $13 billion investment into OpenAI Inc. is the focus of an informal investigation by regulators, after concerns emerged about the AI firm’s exclusive use of Microsoft’s cloud technology. In June, the EU also accused the company of abusing its market power by bundling the Teams video-conferencing app to its other business software.

75,2024-04-25 13:17:41+00:00,How Many Microsoft Shares Do You Need To Earn $100 Per Month In Dividends? (Hint: You're Better Off With This Alternative),  Kevin Vandenboss ,"Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
If you’re looking to generate steady passive income from your investments, dividend stocks like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) might seem like an obvious choice. After all, the tech giant has been a reliable dividend payer for years, consistently increasing its quarterly payout. But before you start loading up on Microsoft shares, let’s crunch the numbers.
To earn $100 per month in dividends from Microsoft, you’d need to own a staggering 400 shares at the current quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share. With Microsoft trading around $409 as of this writing, that would require an eye-watering investment of $163,600.
Sure, you’d be generating a cool $1,200 per year in dividend income. But that only translates to a paltry 0.73% yield on your investment. Suddenly, the passive income dream starts to look a bit less dreamy.
What if I told you there was a way to earn significantly higher yields without having to tie up hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single stock? Enter Arrived Homes, the real estate investing platform that lets you buy shares of rental properties for as little as $100.
On Arrived, the average annualized dividend yield across all offerings is an enticing 4.2%—that’s over five times higher than Microsoft’s current yield. And unlike Microsoft, which pays dividends quarterly, Arrived investors get paid every single month.
Let’s do the math: To generate $100 per month in passive income at a 4.2% yield, you’d need to invest just $28,571. That’s a fraction of the $163,600 you’d have to sink into Microsoft shares to achieve the same income stream.
But here’s the kicker – you don’t need to come up with that full $28,571 all at once. With Arrived, you can get started with just $100 and build your portfolio over time by investing in $10 shares of individual rental properties. That means you can start generating meaningful passive income right away and scale up at your own pace. To help you grow your portfolio even faster, those monthly dividends can be reinvested right back into more properties if you choose.
Of course, no investment is without risk. But by diversifying across multiple properties – each carefully vetted by the platform’s team of real estate experts – you can potentially mitigate some of the risks associated with owning physical real estate directly.
The bottom line? While Microsoft may be a rock-solid company, its dividend alone is unlikely to fund your financial freedom anytime soon. For investors seeking higher yields and the ability to start small, Arrived’s rental property shares offer a compelling alternative.
So why settle for a measly 0.73% yield when there are reliable higher yield options available? Click here to explore current offerings and start building your passive income portfolio today.

76,2024-07-24 22:34:42+00:00,Why Microsoft Stock Dived by Almost 4% Today,"  Eric Volkman, The Motley Fool ","Inaction rather than action was a key cause of tech incumbent Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock dip on Wednesday. A media report stating that the company is apparently unwilling to modify its relationship with a troubled business partner dampened investor sentiment. Ultimately, the shares closed the day nearly 4% lower, a worse performance than the 2.3% dip of the S&P 500 index.
In a brief article published that morning and citing an unidentified ""person familiar with the issue,"" Reuters said that there is no indication the company plans to limit CrowdStrike's (NASDAQ: CRWD) access to Microsoft's Windows operating system.
The news agency did not elaborate, and Microsoft has not yet commented on the story.
Last Friday, CrowdStrike updated its cloud-based software offerings. This didn't exactly go smoothly; a defect found its way into the update, and it crashed millions of Microsoft Windows devices throughout the world. Many of these devices were operated by businesses dependent on them, and the resulting shutdowns were extremely disruptive in numerous instances.
CrowdStrike isn't doing a good job of handling the fallout from the crisis and reassuring clients, and Microsoft isn't pursuing a much smarter strategy. It seems determined to maintain silence on the issue, likely in a play at keeping CrowdStrike sweet (the cybersecurity company is still an important business partner, at least as of this writing).
Neither is a particularly wise approach since many of those customers suffered real reputational and even financial damage from the incident. Microsoft wasn't directly responsible, of course, but it wouldn't hurt the company to be more communicative and contrite about the matter.

77,2024-10-02 08:49:02+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): One of the Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds,  Maleha Afzal ,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other widely held stocks.
The last trading day of September is upon us and so are many questions about the market. On September 30, Dana D’Auria, Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the financial market.
D'Auria regards employment data to be a major concern at the moment. Since inflation rates are subsiding, employment data is something investors should be on the lookout for, along with other data points including GDP and consumer confidence. She suggests that to ensure a soft landing, the Fed must initiate larger rate cuts, and that recessionary conditions are out of the picture.
September is notoriously volatile along with October, and, with elections in another 35 days, the conditions may be slightly different or even more turbulent. According to D'Auria, the 50 basis point cut is a catch-up for July, and expecting a 50 basis point cut in November is borderline questionable.
Overall, she believes that the market has been overshooting and we may have to settle for two 25 basis point cuts before the end of 2024. She reiterates that the job market is crucial and investors must get out of their comfort zone to invest in non-cash opportunities. Investors concerned about low-risk options may consider equities in the defensive sectors that are innately low volatile.
Wall Street is heading to close September and Q3 on a high note and stocks have experienced their best September in over a decade. On September 30, Kevin Gordon, harles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis.
Gordon believes that stocks in the utilities and defensive sectors have caught up to tech stocks amid the AI boom, compared to their financials at the end of FY 2023. However, he does acknowledge that sectors like industrials, financials, and materials are performing relatively well, calling it a case of market broadening.
In terms of market breadth, most sectors are experiencing an upward trajectory. Almost 81% of the S&P 500 members are experiencing an uptrend, despite the quality bias investors may have towards certain stocks. According to Gordon, large-cap quality stocks will continue to perform well despite the volatility and the Fed's decisions. Speaking of smaller-cap stocks, he believes that some stocks may struggle a bit especially when it comes to earnings growth.
Our Methodology
To come up with the 10 most widely held stocks by hedge funds, we sifted through Insider Monkey's database that tracks over 900 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. We ranked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

During the same quarter, Microsoft Cloud had $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 21%. Its productivity/business processes and intelligent cloud segment, on the other hand, logged revenue worth $20.3 billion and $28.5 billion respectively.
The company is a leading investor in artificial intelligence technology. In July, Microsoft and Lumen Technologies partnered to enhance and modernize Lumen’s workloads to Microsoft Azure. Earlier in August, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnered with Palantir Technologies, a data software company, to deploy its suite of products in Microsoft Azure.
The company’s partnerships do not end here. BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft, and MGX recently made a $100 billion deal to enhance the functioning of data centers and AI. The company is also expanding its footprint by establishing engineering development centers in Abu Dhabi, UAE. In addition to that, on September 28, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnered with KT Corporation to accelerate its presence in AI. The five-year partnership with help more than 650,000 businesses and 17 million consumers become a part of the AI wave.
Overall, Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) financial strength coupled with its strategic partnerships make it one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and their stakes amounted to $89.07 billion.
Fred Alger Management’s Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
""Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft’s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure’s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.""
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

79,2024-10-06 16:27:45+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Maintains Overweight Rating Amid Concerns Over Generative AI Revenue and Data Center Demand,  Usman Kabir ,"We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.
US technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk.
While tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI.

This has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave — particularly in software and cloud services.
Their scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants.
Let's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss recently penned an investor note on the firm, maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $508. In the note, the analyst highlighted that investor patience appeared to be wearing thin with the tech giant regarding generative AI revenue, and questions were being asked around the return on investment in GPU spending and the environmental impacts of rising data center demand. Weiss underlined that as a perceived leader in the GenAI opportunity, investors looked to Microsoft for indications on the proper time horizons for seeing revenues start to flow.
Weiss also discussed the return of investment on capex spending by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has risen 75% year-over-year to $55.7 billion, including capital leases. In fiscal 2025, that is expected to rise another 41% to reach $78.4 billion. Per the analyst, the spending question needed to be split into two, with one focused on the gross margin potential of GenAI related solutions, and the other on future model training costs.
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The updated Copilot app will read users a summary of news, a feature called Copilot Daily, and, eventually, personalized reminders. Copilot Vision, which is in preview, can answer questions about text and images users are browsing online and offer guidance — such as suggesting how to furnish an apartment someone is considering purchasing.
The upgraded AI assistant, which starts rolling out Tuesday, works with iOS, Android, Windows and the web, and includes a new version for WhatsApp.
The vision tool requires customers to opt in. In preview, it’s being tested with a limited list of popular web sites so Microsoft can collect data and ensure safety. The data also won’t be stored or used for training, the company said, and the tool won’t work with paywalled and “sensitive” content in the preview.
While Microsoft staked out an early lead in consumer AI owing to its investment in OpenAI, rivals Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are now rolling out AI services aimed at the millions of people who use Android and iOS mobile devices. Microsoft is shut out of that market, so its AI strategy relies heavily on Windows computers, notebooks and tablets.
Earlier this year, the company teamed up with hardware makers to market a line of PCs specially designed to run artificial intelligence applications. So far, reaction to the machines — sold under the Copilot+ PC brand — has been mixed.
In an effort to generate some excitement, Microsoft on Tuesday also announced several new AI features for the devices.
A photo-editing tool lets users enhance older or lower-quality images as well as fill in and erase parts of photos to make them easier to edit. A plain-English search lets users find documents and photos by describing them rather than having to know the file name, while a Click to Do feature brings up a menu of suggested steps or tasks based on what the customer is working on. The new Copilot app will also be available with a click on the Copilot+ PC
Microsoft’s AI consumer chief, Mustafa Suleyman, has pledged to move beyond the utilitarian products the company has long been known for. In an interview, he talked about creating new interfaces and building “experiences that deeply empathize” with users. He acknowledged that getting there will require changing the mindset inside Microsoft, not to mention building new business models.
“Now that we actually have these very conversational interfaces that give you a feeling — that focus on the emotional intelligence of the experience not just the utility — it requires us to exercise a totally new muscle in the organization,” he said.
Suleyman in a blog post explained his vision for Microsoft’s AI future. “With your permission, Copilot will ultimately be able to act on your behalf, smoothing life’s complexities and giving you more time to focus on what matters to you. It will be an advocate for you in many of life’s most important moments,” he wrote, listing things like doctor’s appointments, planning a kid’s birthday party and a “tricky life decision.”

81,2024-05-06 14:47:33+00:00,"Microsoft readies new AI model to compete with Google, OpenAI, The Information reports",Reuters ,"(Reuters) -Microsoft is training a new, in-house AI language model large enough to compete with those from Alphabet's Google and OpenAI, the Information reported on Monday.
The new model, internally referred to as MAI-1, is being overseen by recently hired Mustafa Suleyman, the Google DeepMind co-founder and former CEO of AI startup Inflection, the report said, citing two Microsoft employees with knowledge of the effort.
The exact purpose of the model has not been determined yet and will depend on how well it performs. Microsoft could preview the new model as soon as its Build developer conference later this month, the report said.
Microsoft declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
MAI-1 will be ""far larger"" than the previous smaller, open source models Microsoft had previously trained which means it will be more expensive, according to the report.
Microsoft last month launched a smaller artificial intelligence model called Phi-3-mini as it looks to attract a wider client base with cost-effective options.
The company has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and deployed the ChatGPT maker's technology across its suite of productivity software, allowing it to take an early lead in the generative AI race.
Microsoft has been setting aside large cluster of servers equipped with Nvidia's graphic processing units along with large amounts of data to improve the model, according to the report.
MAI-1 will have roughly 500 billion parameters, the report said, while OpenAI's GPT-4 is reported to have one trillion parameters and Phi-3 mini measures 3.8 billion parameters.
Microsoft tapped Suleyman in March as the head of its newly created consumer AI unit and hired several employees of Inflection.
The new model is not carried over from Inflection, although it may build on training data from the startup, the report added.

82,2024-04-18 11:52:00+00:00,Is Microsoft Stock Going to $475? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So,"  Rich Smith, The Motley Fool ","On a red day for the stock market, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) investors, at least, were happy to hear that CFRA analyst Angelo Zino raised his price target on Microsoft stock to $475 per share.
You will no doubt be shocked to learn that the reason he raised his price target has something to do with artificial intelligence (AI).
Specifically, Zino argued that Microsoft's Azure cloud computing division -- already the company's biggest business by both revenues and profits, earning $37.9 billion on $87.9 billion in revenue last year -- grew a further 29% in Q1 2024. Zino says AI work contributed up to 8 percentage points of the growth.
Combined with contributions from the now Microsoft-owned Activision, the analyst forecasts Microsoft will earn $11.74 per share this year ($0.10 ahead of consensus) and grow that between 14% and 15% in each of the next two years.
That's pretty brisk growth for a behemoth like Microsoft. And yet, despite raising his estimates and price target on Microsoft -- indeed, despite predicting the stock will rise 15% this year -- Zino nonetheless rates Microsoft stock a ""sell.""
Why is that?
It's not entirely clear, but I can at least tell you why I am leery of Microsoft stock. Consider firstly that Microsoft's $82.5 billion in reported net income overstates the cash the company is generating ($67.4 billion in trailing free cash flow [FCF]) by 22%. In fact, it's been three years since Microsoft last generated FCF that matched its reported profits.
Valued on FCF, Microsoft stock trades for a 45x multiple. But Microsoft isn't growing anywhere near quickly enough to justify that valuation. As Zino says, the stock will average only 15% growth over the next few years (and that's faster than other analysts estimate).
Long story short, Microsoft is a very profitable company and is growing quickly for its size. But its FCF is underwhelming and expected to continue to lag reported earnings for years. I'm more inclined to sell it than to buy it.

“We are adjusting the release model for Recall to leverage the expertise of the Windows Insider community to ensure the experience meets our high standards for quality and security,” the company said Thursday in a blog post on its website. “Following receiving feedback on Recall from our Windows Insider Community, as we typically do, we plan to make Recall (preview) available for all Copilot+ PCs coming soon.”
Security researchers criticized Recall almost immediately after its introduction, saying that bad actors could access and scoop up records that are gathered by the tool and stored locally on a user’s PC. Microsoft reacted by saying Recall would be shipped in the “off” position, meaning PC owners would have to choose to use the feature. Additional security measure would be needed before Recall could be activated, the company said.

84,2024-09-19 11:30:39+00:00,Microsoft Corp. (MSFT): Among the Best Fortune 500 Stocks to Buy Now,  Maham Fatima ,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fortune 500 Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other Fortune 500 stocks.
The aggregate revenue of the Fortune 500 companies in 2023 reached a record $41 trillion, up 0.1% year-over-year. Profits also rose 2% after declining earlier in 2022. The US took the lead from Greater China with the most companies on the Fortune 500 list for the first time since 2018. It has 139 companies as of August this year, an increase of 3 from 2023, while Greater China has 133 companies, down 9 from last year.
The financial sector, including banks and insurance companies, led all industries with the most Fortune 500 companies. Collectively tech giants brought in $282 billion in net income, up from $233 billion the previous year. Currently, 13 companies are making their Fortune 500 debut, reflecting the world's fascination with AI and weight-loss drugs.
While the S&P 500 has recovered most of its losses, the rebound is being led by sectors like real estate, utilities, and consumer staples rather than major tech companies. Investors are shifting focus due to concerns over economic growth and expectations of Fed rate cuts.
Still, it seems like investors think that while investment portfolios should be diversified given the current economic conditions, this sentiment does not imply divesting from tech stocks, which of course contribute greatly to the aggregate Fortune 500 revenue. Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management head of Americas Asset Allocation, emphasized this sentiment and we covered this earlier in our article about the 10 Best Tech Stocks To Buy Right Now Under $10:
“...investors should view potential dips in tech stocks as good long-term buying opportunities, as 10% corrections are historically good entry points in tech... He thinks that this market volatility is acyclical. The recent sell-off in the tech sector was not primarily due to economic concerns but rather to sector-specific issues. Despite this, tech giants will continue to benefit from the AI CapEx investment story. While there may be short-term challenges, the long-term outlook for these companies remains positive... Draho also cautioned against over-concentrating portfolios in the sector. He suggested diversifying exposure by investing in sector leaders as well as companies likely to benefit from tech disruption as a way to manage potential downside risks in tech stocks.”
Just last week, Dan Greenhaus, Solus Alternative Asset Management's chief strategist discussed markets, and the rebound's staying power, all while suggesting that predicting the Fed's next move had become more difficult.
He discussed the ongoing recession concerns, particularly after negative comments from financial representatives. Despite these worries, he believes the US consumer is performing well, the economy is stable, and corporate profits are exceeding expectations. This context suggests that the recent sell-off in certain AI stocks was followed by a justified rebound, as issues appear limited to recent trends.
The S&P 500 is currently facing resistance around the 5,600 level, a key point of concern for investors. Dan Greenhaus noted that the recent inversion of the yield curve raised anxiety but the 2-10-year curve is slightly positive. Despite these worries, credit spreads for investment-grade bonds remain stable, and overall cross-asset indicators suggest a stable market environment.
Recently, discussions around potential interest rate changes have gained momentum, particularly following insights from Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. He indicated a likely 25 basis point cut by the Federal Reserve, although he also acknowledged the possibility of a 50 basis point reduction. Greenhaus believes the Fed will opt for a 25 basis point cut, marking the start of a series of reductions. This perspective is supported by the normalization of inflation and a slowing economy.
According to Greenhaus, the cyclical components of the stock market appear to be performing well, indicating that the overall economic fundamentals remain robust, and there is no concrete case for any specific rate cut scenario. As Fortune 500 companies continue to generate record revenues and profits as well, investor sentiments should not be shifting drastically. With that being said, we're here with a list of 10 best Fortune 500 stocks to buy now.
Methodology
We first looked at the list of Fortune 500 companies, as of 2024.

88,2024-05-20 16:43:43+00:00,Is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) the Best Quality Dividend Stock to Buy According to Reddit?,  Vardah Gill ,"Dividend stocks are in the limelight this year as many tech companies have joined the dividend club since the start of 2024. In addition to this, global companies have distributed a record amount in dividends last year. Retail investors are always on the lookout for income stocks. For this reason, we have analyzed the 15 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Reddit in a new article. In this article we are going to take a look at whether Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the best quality dividend stock to buy according to Reddit.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based multinational technology company that is mainly known for its Windows operating systems. In addition to this, the company also offers a wide range of services through its cloud-computing platform. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the most popular company among elite funds at the end of Q4 2023, with 302 hedge funds holding stakes in the company, as per Insider Monkey’s database. The collective value of these stakes is over $87.3 billion.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has revolutionized both personal and business computing with its products for the software industry. The company’s Azure cloud computing platform is widely gaining momentum among business professionals. Its revenue from cloud services is a significant contributor to its total earnings. In the company’s most recent quarter, it reported a 23% year-over-year growth in its cloud revenue at over $35 billion.
Vulcan Value Partners mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software company with a broad range of offerings including Microsoft office, gaming, Azure cloud computing, LinkedIn, and more. It was a material contributor for the second consecutive quarter, and we discussed it at length in last quarter’s letter. The company continues to execute well.”
Where tech companies mainly prefer reinvesting profits into growth and innovation, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) changed the paradigm and initiated its dividend policy in 2003 with a per-share dividend of $0.08. The company has been growing its payouts for the past 18 consecutive years, currently offering a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share. In addition to this, the company’s 5-year average dividend growth rate comes in at 10.23%. With a payout ratio of 25.3%, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s dividend is also sustainable. This means that the company distributes less than one-third of its profits to shareholders as dividends.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently announced its fiscal Q3 2024 earnings and reported revenue of roughly $61.8 billion, which showed a 17% growth from the same period last year. The revenue not only showed growth but also beat analysts’ estimates by $1.01 billion. Its operating income amounted to $27.6 billion, up 23% from the third quarter of 2023. During the quarter, the company generated $32 billion in operating cash flow, up from $24.4 billion in the prior year period. The company’s solid cash position enabled it to uphold its commitment to shareholders by returning $8.4 billion to them through dividends and share repurchases in Q3 2024.
While Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) dividend is strong and sustainable, the stock’s dividend yield tends to come up short when compared to some other high-yield dividend stocks in the market. As of May 18, the stock has a dividend yield of 0.71%, which is less than a 1.3% yield for the S&P 500. The low dividend yield does not satisfy income investors, who seek regular income on their dividend investments. The stock can be added to a diversified dividend portfolio but this means missing out on other high-yield dividend stock opportunities.
According to the Reddit community, Microsoft is currently offering strong financial health along with stable dividend growth. However, some Redditors expressed concerns about the stock being modestly overvalued. The stock is currently trading at a P/E multiple of 36.5x, which is seen as too high by some. Moreover, its competitive industry may push the company to prioritize capital expenditure over dividends to remain relevant.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is picked by Reddi readers as the best quality dividend stock due to its financial health and consistent dividend growth. That said, if you are concerned about its relatively low dividend yield and high valuation you should consider other high-yield dividend stocks on our list of the 15 Best Quality Dividend Stocks to Buy or 5 Undervalued Stocks That Just Raised Their Dividends.

89,2024-05-16 19:20:48+00:00,"Bill Gates Sells Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway Shares In Q1: Are These Still Top Positions?",  Chris Katje ,"Billionaire Bill Gates is best known as the co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). He is also known for his philanthropic efforts with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.
Those two items collided in the first quarter with the sale of Microsoft stock. Here's what to know.
What Happened: Gates stepped down as the CEO of Microsoft in 2000 and later left the board of directors in 2020.
The co-founder of the software giant remains a large shareholder in the company through his own holdings and the stock holdings of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.
A new 13F filing for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust reveals two key changes made in the first quarter.
The trust sold 1.7 million Microsoft shares and 2.6 million shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK). The trades lowered the weighting of these two stocks by 4.5% and 13.1%, respectively.
After the sales, the top holdings of the trust are, with values from the end of the first quarter:
Microsoft: 33.5% of the portfolio, 36,499,597 shares, $15.4 billion
Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM): 16.4% of the portfolio, 35,234,344 shares, $7.5 billion
Berkshire Hathaway: 15.9% of the portfolio, 17,303,097 shares, $7.3 billion
With the latest trades, Berkshire Hathaway moved from the second-place spot down to third place.

Why It's Important: Gates owns Microsoft shares in his Cascade Investments vehicle and his personal holdings. The former CEO once owned 45% of the company when it went public in 1986.
The ownership stake has been reduced over the years by Gates and the foundation trust, which represents his philanthropic efforts.
Berkshire Hathaway, led by Gates' friend Warren Buffett, has been a top investment of Gates and also sees shares donated by Buffett to the trust.
The latest moves in the first quarter come as it was recently announced that Gates' ex-wife Melinda French Gates is stepping down as the co-chair of the trust. French Gates will be leaving for her own philanthropic efforts with an added $12.5 billion commitment.
The former Microsoft CEO is listed as the fifth richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a wealth of $154 billion, up $13.6 billion year-to-date.
Gates' sale of Microsoft stock comes as shares have soared in the last year thanks to new artificial intelligence initiatives and growth. Microsoft shares are up 37% over the last year.

This initiative aims to connect care experiences, bolster team collaboration, empower healthcare workers, and unlock clinical and operational insights.
The launch includes new healthcare AI models in Azure AI Studio, developed in partnership with entities such as Providence and Paige.ai.
These models allow for the integration and analysis of data types such as medical imaging, genomics, and clinical records. They are expected to aid healthcare organisations in building and deploying customised AI solutions rapidly.
Furthermore, Microsoft Fabric now offers healthcare data solutions, providing a comprehensive AI-powered platform to manage and act on data.
In addition, Microsoft Purview's healthcare security application templates are in public preview, offering governance tools for healthcare data.
New capabilities in Microsoft Fabric's healthcare data solutions have also been launched in public preview. These include conversational data integration, social determinants of health public dataset transformation, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data ingestion.
These features aim to streamline data analysis and generate comprehensive insights.
Care management analytics and data discovery and cohorting are also part of the new offerings. These tools are designed to enhance patient care by identifying high-risk individuals, optimising treatment plans and improving care coordination.
Microsoft Healthcare and Life Sciences Solutions and Platforms corporate vice-president Joe Petro said: “We are at an inflection point where AI breakthroughs are fundamentally changing the way we work and live.
“Across the broader healthcare and life sciences industry, these advancements are dramatically enhancing patient care and also rekindling the joy of practising medicine for clinicians. Microsoft’s AI-powered solutions are helping lead these efforts by streamlining workflows, improving data integration, and utilising AI to deliver better outcomes for healthcare professionals, researchers and scientists, payors, providers, medtech developers, and ultimately the patients they all serve.”
The latest development comes after Microsoft and Infosys expanded strategic partnership to expedite the adoption of generative AI and Microsoft Azure among their global customer base.

91,2024-04-16 11:59:04+00:00,"Microsoft Stock Has 23% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst","  John Ballard, The Motley Fool ","After rocketing higher in 2023, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock has continued to hit new highs in 2024, currently up 10% year to date. Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss sees even further upside as the company continues to capture growth opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI) services and the broader cloud market.
The investment wing of the bank updated its price target -- a projection for where the stock will trade in the next year or so -- from $465 to $520 and kept an overweight (buy) rating on the shares. This represents a nearly 26% upside over the current share price of $413.
Microsoft has executed well in capturing the massive opportunity in AI services. Revenue grew 16% year over year in the most recent quarter, with revenue from Microsoft Azure and other cloud services up 28% in constant currency.
Microsoft Azure is seeing larger deal sizes in the $1 billion-plus range. Over half of the Fortune 500 now use Azure's generative AI service powered by OpenAI.
Morgan Stanley sees growing demand for AI services contributing to strong growth over the next five years. Specifically, the firm expects annualized revenue growth of 14% and earnings growth of 16% through fiscal 2029, which seems reasonable given Microsoft's history of double-digit growth. Assuming the stock's valuation stays the same, this is enough to double the value of the shares.
However, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is stretched to the high side after last year's rally. It can still deliver returns for an investor that holds for many years, but the stock's average P/E multiple over the last 10 years is 32 and it's currently trading at over 35 times this year's earnings estimate.
Wall Street's consensus estimate currently has Microsoft hitting $12.52 in earnings in fiscal 2025 ending in June. Assuming the stock's P/E stretched to 40, that would put the share price at $500 and short of the analyst's target. The analyst may be a bit over-optimistic with this price target.

92,2024-09-12 18:59:54+00:00,Is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) the Best AI Stock to Buy According to Billionaire David Tepper?,  Attiya Zainib ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper. Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.
Billionaire David Tepper stands out amongst American hedge fund managers for his two recent moves: his bet on Chinese stocks despite their volatility and underperformance and his early arrival at the AI party.
David Tepper’s passion for investing goes all the way back to his high-school days. He once recalled:
“I remember my dad had made some small investments in a few companies, so I would track them and see how he was doing.”
Tepper bought his first stock when he was in high school — 100 shares of a $2 stock, “but then the whole thing went bankrupt,” he said.
“It was a bad investment, but that didn’t deter me.”
Today, Tepper is worth about $20 billion. He was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn’t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper’s instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he’d joined in 1985.
Tepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the midst of the market crash of 1987.
According to The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World’s Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:
“Going into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short—I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,” he says with a chuckle. “It was very cool.” Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn’t do as well. “I still got a raise but not as much as I should have.”
Tepper’s fund Appaloosa Management has released its latest holdings data and it’s time to see which AI stocks are in the billionaire’s portfolio. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Billionaire David Tepper’s Stake: $528,007,064
Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently fell following its latest quarterly results which showed the company’s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.
But what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office’s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year’s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year’s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year’s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.
While Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and will bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year’s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.
Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses, both large and small, navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company’s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all scales. Microsoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of innovative, AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT, while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft’s solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low-double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.”

93,2024-05-26 07:36:00+00:00,Could Microsoft Stock Help You Retire a Millionaire?,"  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ","Stocks can help you retire rich. Not as in ""get rich quick,"" but steady compounders that slowly and surely make you money for decades. Those companies are challenging to find. To help in your search, know that technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of them.
How do I know? Well, past performance does provide some indication (although it's no guarantee of future performance). A $10,000 investment made in Microsoft in 1986 would be worth over $70 million today.
Naturally, such strong past results beg the question: Is there juice left to squeeze from this stock?
Here is why Microsoft can still, despite its massive size and success, help you retire a millionaire.
Microsoft sustained success over decades by squarely inserting itself into every significant technology breakthrough, ranging from enterprise software with Windows and Microsoft Office to cloud computing and now artificial intelligence (AI). Research by PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that AI will create over $15 trillion in economic value by the decade's end. Microsoft has clear early competitive advantages in capturing its share of that added value.
For starters, Microsoft has a financial relationship with OpenAI, the AI developer that created ChatGPT. Among the terms of their partnership is the requirement that OpenAI's computing needs run through Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform. This could funnel a lot of cloud activity to Microsoft as AI grows.
Additionally, Microsoft is already a data center powerhouse thanks to its Azure business. The company has an estimated 160 data centers across 60 regions worldwide, a global network of computing power that can take on the demanding workload that AI has and will create in the future.
Plus, it's not like Microsoft is a one-trick AI pony. The potential upside of AI is the icing on the cake. Azure is already the world's second-largest cloud platform behind Amazon's AWS. The Windows and Office software ecosystem that built the modern Microsoft is still arguably as dominant today as it was two decades ago.
Do you want a years-long growth track record? Just feast your eyes below:
Now approaching a quarter-trillion in annual revenue, Microsoft may eventually struggle to continue increasing in size. However, the business is so profitable that it could easily drive per-share metrics higher for the foreseeable future (more on that below). Analysts still peg Microsoft to grow earnings by an average of 16% annually over the next three to five years.
Microsoft could flex its muscles to shareholders in the per-share financials. The company is raking over $70 billion in annual free cash flow. Free cash flow accounts for capital spending, so that's all discretionary cash that can go to shareholders or the balance sheet.
You can see that Microsoft has augmented per-share earnings by aggressively retiring stock for years. Additionally, Microsoft has paid a dividend and increased it for 22 consecutive years. Despite the increases, the payout is only 30% of Microsoft's cash flow, which gives management plenty of financial flexibility.
Microsoft's anticipated mid-teens-percentage earnings growth outlook strongly indicates solid investment returns ahead. At that rate, Microsoft's earnings would double every four to five years, pushing the share price higher, even if some air comes from the stock's valuation.
Unless Microsoft's business dries up, it's hard to see this recipe of share repurchases and dividend growth failing for the foreseeable future. The stock's market cap may not grow as fast, but per-share financials look poised to carry the onus of generating investment results.
Microsoft's massive size and trajectory are what you get when a stellar company finds its way into several massive markets and remains on top for prolonged periods. AI looks like the next chapter in Microsoft's great story, which bodes well for aspiring millionaire investors. It may not get investors there all on its own, but it will help.

94,2024-10-08 15:46:12+00:00,Microsoft's Stock Has One Fewer 'Buy' Rating on Wall Street Today,  Rob McLean ,"
Analysts at Oppenheimer downgraded shares of Microsoft from ""outperform"" to ""perform"" on Tuesday.
That's rare on Wall Street, with nearly all of the analysts currently tracking the software giant holding ""buy"" or equivalent ratings.
The stock rose Tuesday, leaving it up about 11% on the year.

Optimism about AI-related growth has helped shares of Microsoft (MSFT) this year, but at least one investment bank is urging caution about what might come next.
Oppenheimer analysts on Tuesday downgraded shares of Microsoft to “perform” from “outperform.” That's rare on Wall Street, with nearly all of the analysts currently tracking the software giant holding ""buy"" or equivalent ratings, according to Visible Alpha.
Shares of Microsoft were recently up about 1%, slightly outperforming the broader market. The stock is up more than 11% for the year.
""Open AI losses are the primary concern and could be in the $2-3B range in FY25, which we were not previously modeling,"" the analysts wrote Tuesday. Open AI is an independent company, but it has a ""strategic partnership"" with Microsoft. “Enterprises have been slow to adopt AI and associated revenues will likely disappoint.”
In a September report, Oppenheimer said it was “tweaking down near term AI revenue, but tweaking up CapEx spending, mostly for Microsoft.” The company is investing in ""once-in-a-generation technology,"" the analysts wrote, so ""we don’t believe expanding margins will be a short-term priority.”
Oppenheimer also said that Microsoft's shares are trading near the midpoint of the five-year range for its price-to-earnings ratio and ""could trade to the lower end"" down the line.

95,2024-10-09 06:22:17+00:00,Microsoft Corp (MSFT): Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years,  Neha Gupta ,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other the Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years.
The US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts.
Jamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market.

Powell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month’s half-point cut, but there’s market debate on the pace.
Soaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop.
Nevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves.
Apart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions.
According to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. “The bull market has survived the year’s historically weakest quarter,” said Hill in an interview with CNBC. “It is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.”
When considering which stocks to buy, it’s beneficial to ask, “Which industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?” Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million.
Some of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence.
In an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves.
According to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward.
With this economic perspective in mind, let’s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years.

To compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024.
At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279
Amid the artificial intelligence race, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is arguably one of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, given the investments it’s made around the emerging technology. The company is also leveraging the technology to strengthen its cloud computing solution under Azure.
Azure is the source of the largest AI opportunity from all this. With a current % market share of 25%, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest provider of cloud computing services after Amazon, and its new AI tools are helping it grow even further.
During the Q4 earnings call, the management reported that Azure now has 60,000 AI customers, which is approximately 60% more than it had during the same quarter last year. Given that Goldman Sachs projects that the cloud computing industry will generate $2 trillion in sales by 2030, Microsoft should be one of the beneficiaries, allowing it to generate more shareholder value.
AI is already driving some of that growth, and Microsoft stands to gain as more businesses turn to its AI cloud services to improve their own AI offerings.
Additionally, it has turned to technology to strengthen and enhance user experience on its office solutions, including Microsoft Office. Its investment of close to $13 billion in ChatGPT parent OpenAI has also had a hand in strengthening its search tool Bing sits to take on Google.
Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) regularly reports strong financial results; the most recent quarter was no exception. Its operating income and revenue grew by 15% annually, which is remarkable for a business of this size. Earnings per share (EPS) exceeded analysts’ estimates, landing at $2.95.
Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s ability to boost profitability while growing steadily is demonstrated by the growth of its earnings per share, affirming its ability to make shareholders rich. Over the previous five years, its outstanding share count has only dropped by about 3%, so a large portion of the growth can be linked to its improved earnings.
Amid the earnings growth, Microsoft continues to reward investors with a 0.80% dividend yield even as it trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and their stakes amounted to $89.07 billion.
Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.”
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

96,2024-05-10 12:15:00+00:00,Why Isn't Microsoft's Stock Soaring After This Latest Monster News?,"  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ","While some stocks rise and fall sharply during earnings season, others stand pat. That's pretty much what Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) did, as the stock only rose slightly more than the broader market (measured by the S&P 500) the day following earnings.
However, when you dig into the quarter, it may make some wonder why the stock wasn't up more because it was truly incredible. If it should be up more, this could potentially be an opportunity to get in before other investors realize what they've missed.
Microsoft has become a behemoth during its long rise to become the largest company in the world. Although it used to claim the title (alongside Apple) of a $3 trillion company, it no longer sits above that threshold. But with these results in mind, it may return there.
The law of large numbers states that the larger a figure is, the closer it will be to the average population. When applied to companies and their growth rates, this means that giants like Microsoft shouldn't be growing any faster than the average of all other companies in the market. But Microsoft flies in the face of this assumption.
In the third quarter (ended March 31), Microsoft's revenue rose 17%, and earnings per share (EPS) increased by 20% year over year. That's much faster than most companies, making these results all the more impressive. Furthermore, all of its business segments exceeded the expectations given in Q2.

Data source: The Motley Fool and Microsoft. YOY = year over year.
But there is one business segment that's doing the heavy lifting. Of Microsoft's three business groups, Intelligent Cloud was the outlier, with its revenue rising 21% year over year to $26.7 billion (35% of its total revenue). This was powered by Microsoft Azure's incredible growth of 31% -- the best of the three major cloud-computing competitors. Why is cloud computing doing so well? It's likely related to artificial intelligence (AI).
AI requires massive data storage and computing power to create the best models. Most companies can't justify purchasing their own server to store and process this data, so they rent computing power from Microsoft. This is convenient for the customer, as they can scale their usage up or down as needed or rent more computing power when they have a large model to run.
As everyone rushes to implement AI into their business, Microsoft is seeing a huge demand surge that's boosting Azure and other cloud services Microsoft provides. Given how well Microsoft is doing, you'd think its stock would be up, but that's not the case.
There's a great reason why Microsoft stock is still fairly flat after earnings. Leading into the quarter, Microsoft needed to post a perfect quarter to avoid a drop from its lofty levels.
Microsoft's stock was trading at nearly 39 times earnings less than a month ago but still trades for an expensive 35 times earnings after results. That's a premium price reserved only for a few companies growing quickly or executing at a high level. For reference, AI powerhouse Nvidia currently trades at 34 times forward earnings.
So, for Microsoft to avoid a valuation drop, it needed to post a perfect quarter, which it essentially did. Microsoft still has a premium valuation, so its Q4 execution must be similarly flawless.
As a result, I don't think now is a great time to buy Microsoft stock, as there isn't much room for upside. Instead, investors should shift their focus to other companies that are delivering similar execution levels but trade for much lower premiums.
Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.
On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:
Amazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,174!*
Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $34,483!*
Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $328,682!*
Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

97,2024-08-08 15:57:32+00:00,Microsoft’s new alliance and Anduril’s sky-high $14 billion valuation show defense tech is heating up,  David Meyer ,"It’s been a big couple days in the increasingly active defense tech sector.
Today, Microsoft and Palantir announced they will bundle their AI services for U.S. military and intelligence, with Microsoft contributing GPT-4 and other OpenAI models, and Palantir throwing in its targeting, data-analysis, and action-proposing tools. This is the first partnership around deploying Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service in classified environments, Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar noted in a statement—though Microsoft, on its own, did deploy GPT-4 to its Azure Government Top Secret environment in May. And of course, the relevant government agencies still need to bite.
Microsoft and Palantir say their combined services could be used in logistics, contracting, and action planning, among other things.
As Military.com reported last month, there is little agreement among the armed forces regarding the use of generative AI. Some have security concerns, such as the Space Force (which has paused the use of the technology) and the Navy. The Army is reportedly more open to generative AI, though it still lacks clear rules to govern its use.
Earlier this week, Palantir also delivered a Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) prototype to a military base in Washington State, Axios reported. TITAN is a wheeled ground station system that uses AI to assist targeting decisions, based on data collected from sensors in the air, on land, and in space.
Palantir won the $178.4 million Army deal a couple of months back and will develop 10 TITAN prototypes for testing. Bearing in mind that we’re talking about what’s generally seen as a data company, it’s remarkable that it’s now delivering hardware—thanks to subcontractors such as Northrop Grumman and Anduril.
Speaking of Anduril, Palmer Luckey’s defense tech startup just pulled in a fresh $1.5 billion in funding, as it takes aim at the more traditional likes of Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin—Anduril recently won out against these rivals for an Air Force contract to develop and test prototypes of small, unmanned fighter jets.
The new round, co-led by Founders Fund and Sands Capital, values Anduril at $14 billion, which TechCrunch points out is a darn sight more than the $8.5 billion valuation the firm boasted less than two years ago. It’s also more than the $12.5 billion valuation that Anduril was reportedly seeking less than three months ago.
As my colleague Luisa Beltran wrote a couple weeks ago, defense tech—particularly when it involves hardware—is becoming a more attractive bet for investors than used to be the case. That’s partly because software is looking less lucrative in a scenario where AI becomes a capable coder, and partly because of the wars in Ukraine and Israel/Palestine, plus geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China.
See also: Germany’s Helsing raising $489 million in July, at a valuation of $5.4 billion. The defense AI firm’s previous round in September last year pulled in less than half that amount, at less than a third of the valuation.
There are of course serious ethical questions about the use of AI for target selection, and not much in the way of an international legal framework for controlling the phenomenon. Reported deployments in Gaza and Ukraine make these questions more urgent than anyone might have expected a couple years back—and so do deals like those on display this week.

98,2024-01-09 11:00:00+00:00,Why Microsoft Stock Rallied 57% in 2023,"  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ","Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) charged sharply higher in 2023, soaring 57%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The rally was in sharp contrast to Microsoft's performance in 2022 when the stock plunged 29%.
While the improving economic landscape no doubt helped fuel the rise, the biggest contributor to Microsoft's impressive gains was the game-changing rise of artificial intelligence (AI).
2023 kicked off with buzz surrounding the capabilities of ChatGPT, the brainchild of OpenAI. Soon after its release, the chatbot quickly became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, attracting 100 million active users just two months after its debut.
Microsoft had made an initial investment of $1 billion in the company back in 2019, but the ability of generative AI to create original content and streamline mundane and time-consuming tasks was revolutionary. Microsoft reportedly boosted its stake to $13 billion while integrating AI across a wide swath of its products and services -- thus serving as the catalyst for the AI gold rush that followed.
These capabilities led directly to the development of Copilot, a digital assistant designed to interact with Microsoft's core productivity programs to save users time and make them even more productive. Copilot could summarize emails and draft responses, outline meetings, search spreadsheets for items that met specific criteria, create presentations in PowerPoint, and even draft and review computer code.
Copilot was a hit with Microsoft users, with roughly 40% of Fortune 100 companies participating in the company's early access, or ""pilot"" program. In an interview late last year, CFO Amy Hood said, ""The next-generation AI business will be the fastest-growing $10 billion business in our history.""
Most recently, Microsoft's Azure Cloud reaped the benefits of the company's AI moves, as its cloud revenue grew 29% year over year, outpacing both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Alphabet's Google Cloud, which grew 12% and 22%, respectively. This was all the more remarkable since it followed seven consecutive quarters of decelerating year-over-year growth for Azure. Perhaps more importantly, the company attributed the acceleration to AI, with ""roughly three points"" of its cloud growth resulting from accelerating demand for AI services.
There could be more to come for Microsoft. While the company demonstrated resilience in the face of the downturn, its PC segment has only just begun to rebound. Furthermore, we haven't yet seen the full extent of Copilot adoption on Microsoft's results, which will no doubt ramp over time. Evercore IS analyst Kirk Materne suggests that AI could generate incremental revenue of more than $100 billion for Microsoft by 2027. For context, Microsoft generated revenue of roughly $212 billion in fiscal 2023 (which ended June 30), so this represents a significant opportunity.
Its large base of productivity software users and Azure cloud customers gives Microsoft a vast, untapped market to peddle its AI wares. As such, 2023's gains could be just the beginning. Microsoft stock is a buy.

99,2024-04-16 21:00:18+00:00,"Microsoft invests $1.5 billion in AI firm G42, overseen by UAE's national security adviser",Associated Press Finance ,"REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Microsoft is investing $1.5 billion in a technology firm based in the United Arab Emirates and overseen by the country’s powerful national security adviser.
Microsoft and the technology holding company G42 announced the deal Tuesday. As part of the agreement, Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, will join G42's board of directors.
The deal “was developed in close consultation with both the UAE and U.S. governments,” Microsoft said.
Based in Abu Dhabi, G42 runs data centers in the Middle East and elsewhere and has increasingly identified itself as an AI firm. It has built what's considered the world’s leading Arabic-language AI model, known as Jais.
Microsoft said G42 will run its AI applications and services on the U.S. tech giant's cloud computing platform, and the two companies will work to bring digital infrastructure to countries where G42 has established a presence in the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa.
G42 has previously said it would cut ties to Chinese hardware suppliers over American concerns it was too close to the Chinese government.
The company has faced spying allegations for its ties to a mobile phone app identified as spyware. It has also faced claims it could have gathered genetic material secretly from Americans for the Chinese government.
Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE's national security adviser, is chairman of the company’s board.
The U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday described the UAE as a “global player in cutting edge technology” and said it is working with it and other countries toward “verifiable commitments” for the safe development and deployment of such technologies.
""When responsibly managed, investments like the one announced today have the potential to further innovation in digital technologies around the world,” spokesperson Brittany Caplin said in a written statement.

100,2024-09-28 14:25:15+00:00,Jim Cramer on Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): ‘The Analysts Warned About A Diminishing AI Lead For The Club Holding’,  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ,"We recently compiled a list of the Cramer's Morning Thoughts: 20 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer.
In a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer explains that if you're investing with real money, not just playing a simulation like a stock market game, it’s essential to open a real investment account. Reflecting on his own experience from 1979, he recalls that there were no online accounts back then. Since he already had some money in a Mellon Fund account through Fidelity, he decided to open his individual stock account with them as well.
In the early days of his investing journey, Cramer admits he didn’t have a clear source for stock ideas, so he turned to Forbes, a magazine he trusted. One article caught his eye about American Agronomics, a promising orange-growing company in Florida. It looked like a good opportunity, so he invested in 10 shares. Unfortunately, disaster struck when a frost destroyed the crops, slashing his investment in half. Cramer likens this experience to the storyline of the movie Trading Places. While the loss was painful, he emphasizes that it didn't crush his determination to keep learning and investing.
""At first, I didn’t know where to look for stock ideas, so I turned to a magazine I liked, Forbes. No offense to Forbes, but I read an interesting article about American Agronomics, a compelling orange grower in Florida. It seemed like a solid pick, so I bought 10 shares. Later, a frost hit, wiping out the crops and cutting my investment in half— a bit like the plot of Trading Places, if you’ve ever seen that classic Eddie Murphy movie. I was devastated but not defeated.""
Jim Cramer shares a story about one of his early investing experiences. After suffering a loss on his previous investment, he sold off his remaining shares and used the leftover money to buy seven shares of Bobby Brooks, a clothing company recommended by Forbes. Unfortunately, the company reported poor financial results, and Cramer lost even more money. At the time, he had a stable job at American Lawyer magazine, earning $20,000 a year, and was living in a small, affordable studio apartment. This low cost of living allowed him to quickly rebuild his stock portfolio despite his earlier losses.
During his work travels, Cramer once had a great breakfast at Bob Evans Farms and discovered the company was publicly traded. Intrigued, he returned to New York and went to the Midtown Manhattan Public Library, where he studied everything he could find about Bob Evans Farms and compared it with other companies in the same industry. Based on this research, he bought 20 shares of the company. His investment paid off when the stock rose after a strong financial quarter and a stock split. Through this experience, Cramer learned an important lesson: ""Know what you own.""
""During my travels for work, I once had an amazing breakfast at Bob Evans Farms and learned that the company was publicly traded. When I returned to New York, I visited the Midtown Manhattan Public Library, read everything I could about Bob Evans, and compared it with other companies in the industry. Armed with that research, I bought 20 shares. The stock rose immediately following a good quarter and a stock split. That’s when I learned my first key investment lesson: know what you own.""
Jim Cramer shared that his passion for stocks didn't ignite in adulthood after law school or college, or even in high school. It started much earlier, back in the fourth grade. According to him, his father would bring home the Philadelphia Bulletin, one of the largest newspapers in the country at the time. While most kids would eagerly flip to the comics or sports section, Jim was a huge Phillies fan, he found himself intrigued by something else. Curiosity got the best of him.
The business section of the paper, full of lists of names and numbers, looked like an indecipherable code compared to the baseball stats he regularly pored over. Terms like ""open,"" ""range,"" and ""close"" didn't make any sense to him, so he asked his dad, who had some experience dabbling in the stock market.
His dad encouraged him, and Jim began tracking stock names he heard on the radio, keeping a record of their daily performance in a ledger. For him, it became a fun game of prediction, much like analyzing baseball stats. He didn’t know much about the companies he was tracking, many were defense stocks that were performing well due to the Vietnam War, but it didn’t matter. The thrill of figuring out the next move kept him hooked.
Not long after, Jim introduced this ""stock game"" to his fifth-grade class during show-and-tell, showing off his ledger and inviting his classmates to join in the fun. Though not everyone was interested, the lesson was clear: starting early can ignite a lifelong interest. For Cramer, this early exposure to the stock market became the foundation of his love for investing.
""Fast forward a bit, and I introduced this ""stock game"" to my fifth-grade class during show-and-tell, showing off my ledger and challenging my classmates to play. Not everyone was into it, but the lesson here is clear: get them started early. That’s how I fell in love with the stock market.""
Jim Cramer's takeaway from his childhood stock obsession is simple: start young. The stock market is a long-term game, and the earlier you get involved, the higher your chances of winning will get.

""There was a rare downgrade of Microsoft as DA Davidson moves to neutral. The analysts warned about a diminishing AI lead for the Club holding.""
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s positive investment outlook is built on its strong performance in cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and productivity tools, along with continued growth in key business areas. AI integration into products like Azure and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) 365 has been a major revenue driver, with Azure showing impressive 30% year-over-year growth, largely thanks to AI services.
In its Q2 2024 earnings report, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) delivered outstanding results, with revenues of $62 billion, an 18% increase from the previous year, and a net income of $21.9 billion, reflecting 33% growth. This growth was primarily driven by the intelligent cloud division, which posted a 20% year-over-year increase due to the rising demand for AI-powered solutions. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s AI innovations, including GitHub Copilot and Microsoft Fabric, boost user productivity by automating complex tasks in applications like Word, Excel, and Teams.
Additionally, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s investments in AI infrastructure, such as the Maia 100 AI Accelerator and new data centers, underline its commitment to staying competitive in the AI space, improving both efficiency and profitability in the long run. Beyond AI, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s personal computing and business processes segments also performed well, with 19% and 13% growth, respectively, driven by strong demand for Windows, Surface devices, and Office products.
Overall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

101,2024-07-19 04:40:16+00:00,"Microsoft stock falls as outage grounds flights, Azure services impacted",Investing.com ,"Investing.com-- Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) experienced an outage in its Azure and Office365 services which saw at least two low-cost U.S. airlines ground multiple flights on late-Thursday, with services still remaining suspended into early-Friday.
Microsoft stock fell 1.8% in pre-market trade Friday.
Frontier Airlines said its systems were gradually normalizing on early-Friday and that it was in the process of resuming flights, after its systems were affected by what it described as a “Microsoft outage which is also affecting other companies.”
Frontier had grounded several flights, as did Sun Country Airlines, although the latter said that one of its “information vendors” was experiencing a global outage.
Microsoft reported an outage in its Azure cloud computing platform on late-Thursday, and that it was working to restore service.
A note on the company’s website attributed the Azure outage to a “configuration change in a portion of our Azure backend workloads, caused interruption between storage and compute resources which resulted in connectivity failures that affected downstream Microsoft 365 services dependent on these connections.”
The firm said it had completed mitigation efforts with the Azure service, but did not specify whether the service was back online.
The company’s service health status website showed its 365 service was also experiencing “degredation,” and that users will be unable to access several Microsoft 365 apps and services.
Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

44% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders
 Recent sales by insiders 
If you want to know who really controls Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 73% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Microsoft.
 Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft 
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
We can see that Microsoft does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Microsoft, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Microsoft is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. With 7.3% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.
Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Microsoft Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.1b worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 27% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Microsoft   you should know about.
But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

103,2024-05-18 09:35:00+00:00,"This Stock Has Trounced Microsoft, Alphabet, and AMD. It Has Nothing to Do With AI.","  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ","The big story in the stock market over the past few years has been artificial intelligence (AI). Generative AI, which can create text, images, videos, and audio, looks likely to be a transformative technology. Tech leaders like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Advanced Micro Devices are betting heavily on AI to drive growth.
While the stocks of all three of those AI-centric companies have surged over the past year, they have been beaten handily by a stock that has absolutely nothing to do with AI. Investing is about more than chasing buzzwords. The tried-and-true method of finding unappreciated companies with solid growth prospects trading at pessimistic valuations still works.
This mystery stock has more than doubled over the past year, beating all three of the aforementioned tech companies by large margins. It has also trounced Microsoft, Alphabet, and AMD over the past three years, nearly tripling in that time.
The stock is Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ: SFM), a small chain of grocery stores that does things differently from the major supermarket chains. That strategy has been paying off, and Sprouts still has plenty of growth ahead as it expands its footprint.
Sprouts operated 414 stores in 23 states as of March 31. Each store is relatively small. Its older stores are around 30,000 square feet, while its newer stores are even smaller at approximately 23,000 square feet. While the size of traditional supermarkets varies, they're often substantially larger.
Keeping its stores small reduces the cost of building new stores, lowers the ongoing operating costs, and allows Sprouts to build in locations where larger supermarkets wouldn't make sense. The average new store costs just $3.8 million. First-year sales average $13 million, with 20% to 25% annual growth over the following four years.
Sprouts focuses on two things: produce and attribute-based items. Each store features a large produce section with affordable prices. It makes a point to beat competitors on price.
About 70% of the products Sprouts sells are attribute-based -- meaning gluten-free, organic, vegan, non-GMO, and the like. It doesn't try to compete with the big supermarket chains on selection, instead curating a differentiated assortment of products. This works well with the company's customer base, which skews toward the wealthy and college-educated.
The Sprouts model is working. Comparable-store sales (comps) were up 4% in the first quarter of this year, and the company expects 3% to 4% comps growth for the full year. Adjusted earnings per share will top $3 this year, according to the company's guidance, up from just $1.25 in 2019.
Sprouts will open 35 new stores this year. In 2025 and beyond, the company plans to increase its store count by about 10% annually. It sees opportunities to open more than 300 new stores in its expansion markets, which include Texas, California, Florida, and portions of the East Coast.
Based on the company's guidance, the stock trades for about 25 times forward earnings even after the multiyear rally that has propelled shares to market-trouncing gains. With the company expecting 10% store growth, low single-digit comps growth, and stable profit margins, double-digit annual earnings growth is in the cards.
That valuation looks reasonable given the chain's growth potential. It could also be an acquisition target. Amazon snagged Whole Foods, another differentiated grocery chain, in 2017. Sprouts could be an attractive acquisition for a larger chain hunting for growth.
The grocery industry is tough, and consumer behavior can shift unexpectedly. Sprouts is navigating the post-pandemic environment well so far, and the company looks poised to greatly expand its footprint in the coming years. While the stock might not repeat its performance from the past few years, it looks like a solid long-term investment.

104,2024-04-26 20:35:34+00:00,"Alphabet, Microsoft earnings show hefty AI bets are driving growth",  Aditya Soni ,"By Aditya Soni
(Reuters) -Alphabet and Microsoft ignited a rally in technology stocks on Friday with earnings that showed big AI investments were driving growth, allaying doubts that their costly bets would take time to pay off after a soft forecast from Meta Platforms.
Alphabet surged 10% and closed with a stock market value above $2 trillion for the first time, according to LSEG data, after the company sweetened the pot for investors with its maiden dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback.
The world's fourth most valuable firm flirted with the milestone on an intraday basis over three years ago, according to LSEG Datastream.
Microsoft gained nearly 2% and added about $54 billion to its market value.
After pouring billions of dollars into the infrastructure needed to support AI applications, both Alphabet and Microsoft reported that their quarterly revenue growth was outpacing expectations as more users turn to services including the Copilot AI assistant and the Gemini chatbot.
AI services accounted for 7 percentage points of the 31% jump in revenue at Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing platform between January and March, finance chief Amy Hood said.
She added near-term AI demand was a bit higher than the company's capacity, which held back growth in the quarter and highlighted the need for spending to expand its infrastructure.
At Google, cloud revenue jumped about 28% with strong growth in Google Workspace, where the Alphabet unit offers a slew of AI features powered by its large language model Gemini.
The results contrasted with a warning of higher spending and softer-than-expected growth from social media giant Meta, whose stock tumbled 10% on Thursday.
""This quarter illustrated how demand remains high for generative AI from Microsoft customers, and we continue to believe that Microsoft sits as a leader in this GenAI environment,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said.
""Meta is indicating the results of further increased investment may be years away while Microsoft and Google are showing them right now.""
The results also sparked a rise of 3.4% in Amazon.com, which will report earnings on Tuesday.
""The three hyperscalers (major cloud companies) we've heard from thus far all highlighted a similar message on AI capital expenditure - this is an arms race, the AI opportunity is enormous, and spending will continue to be aggressive/ahead of market expectations,"" Bernstein analyst Michael Chiang said.
Microsoft's capital expenditures grew by $300 million from the previous quarter to $11.5 billion, while Alphabet's capital expenditures were $12 billion, a 91% jump from a year prior.
At least 28 analysts raised their price targets on Alphabet, pushing the median view to $190, compared with its last close of $156. Microsoft saw at least 25 price-target increases from analysts, with the median view on the stock now at $475.
Microsoft has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30.40, compared with Alphabet's 21.63.
Some analysts believe the more premium valuation was justified. ""Google Cloud showed improvement but less than the growth of Azure. Azure's enterprise focus and their differentiated capabilities played a part and we (and the market) await Amazon Web Services results,"" Bernstein analysts said.

105,2024-04-26 13:45:23+00:00,Microsoft beats Q3 top and bottom lines on cloud strength, Daniel Howley    · Technology Editor,"Microsoft (MSFT) shares rose on Friday after it reported its fiscal third quarter earnings, beating analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines on the strength of its cloud computing business.
“Microsoft Copilot and Copilot stack are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement.
Microsoft said on Thursday that its AI services contributed 7 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue. That's up from 6 percentage points in Q2, and 3 points in Q1. Microsoft first broke out its AI percentage contributions to Azure in Q4 last year, saying it added 1 percentage point to Azure revenue at the time.
The company also said it anticipates Q4 revenue of between $63.5 billion and $64.5 billion, just a head of analysts' expectations of $64.7 billion.
Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said during the company's earnings call that the tech giant is seeing near term AI demand outstrip available capacity.
Shares of Microsoft were up about 2% on Friday.
Microsoft reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.94 on revenue of $61.9 billion. Wall Street was anticipating EPS of $2.83 on revenue of $60.88 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Microsoft's overall commercial cloud revenue came in at $35.1 billion, ahead of Wall Street estimates of $33.93 billion. On a segment bases, Microsoft saw Productivity and Business Processes revenue of $19.57 billion, beating expectations of $19.54 billion. Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing revenue came in at $26.71 billion and $15.58 billion, respectively. That was better than the $26.25 billion and $15.07 billion analysts expected, respectively.
The revenue beat in More Personal Computing was driven by 11% growth in Windows OEM sales to PC manufacturers and 62% growth in Xbox content and services sales, with 61% attributable to the net impact of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
Shares of Microsoft are up more than 10% year to date, behind rivals such as Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), which are up 15% and 22%, respectively. Over the last 12 months, Microsoft’s shares have climbed 32%, though Amazon has jumped 67%, while Google is up 47%.
The three companies are battling it out to see which can offer the most comprehensive AI solutions to enterprise customers and customers, whether that means making heavy investments in third-party firms like OpenAI and Anthropic or reorganizing their internal teams like Google.
Microsoft’s AI ambitions got a healthy boost on Tuesday when it announced that Coca-Cola (KO) signed a five-year, $1.1 billion agreement to use the software giant’s Azure cloud services and AI technology.
“Through our long-term partnership, we have made significant progress to accelerate system-wide AI transformation across The Coca-Cola Company and its network of independent bottlers worldwide,” Microsoft executive vice president and chief commercial officer Judson Althoff said in a statement.
Microsoft has unleashed a torrent of new AI features and services for its enterprise and productivity apps and consumer platforms ever since it first debuted its revamped version of Bing and its AI chatbot in February 2023.
In March, Microsoft announced that it hired DeepMind AI and Inflection AI co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, fellow Inflection AI co-founder Karén Simonyan, as well as a number of the company’s staff members. Suleyman is taking up a new post at Microsoft as CEO of the Microsoft AI division.
In February, Microsoft announced a multiyear partnership with French AI startup Mistral that would allow Microsoft to offer the company’s models on its Azure platform.

106,2024-09-12 10:03:16+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): A Very Important AI Stock According to BlackRock,  Usman Kabir ,"We recently compiled a list of the 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks.
Artificial intelligence has been the buzzword around Wall Street for many months but a recent selloff in the technology sector has ignited fears of an AI bubble. Investors are looking towards experts to help them make better investment decisions. In a recent commentary on the AI market, as well as the macro conditions surrounding the economy, the investment titan highlighted multiple factors contributing to market volatility, including recession concerns, pre-US election jitters, and profit-taking. Despite these, the investment firm noted, US corporate earnings have been resilient, with the S&P 500 showing 13% growth in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing expectations. The AI sector remained a key theme of this growth, but BlackRock relented that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech companies. In this environment, the investment firm recommended diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure.

Overall, the wealth wizard advocated for broadening investment exposure beyond US tech stocks, particularly into sectors benefiting from ongoing AI buildout, while remaining cautious about Japanese equities and US short-term bonds. In the weekly commentary, the advisory highlighted that the US economy appeared more resilient than anticipated, with broad-based earnings growth suggesting stability. However, inflation remained a concern, and BlackRock expects it to limit how much the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates in the medium term. The investment firm noted that markets were pricing in significant rate cuts, but expectations seemed overblown given persistent inflation pressures, especially from wage growth. The investment titan suggested looking to European markets for income opportunities and remaining underweight on short-dated US Treasuries in favor of medium-term maturities and quality credit.
The investment firm also underlined the broader market backdrop in the weekly commentary, noting that US stocks fell due to recession fears, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest weekly drop in 18 months. Treasury yields also declined as investors priced in expected Fed rate cuts. The advisory, however, viewed these recession fears as overstated, pointing to US jobs data that showed slowing but steady employment growth. Analysts at the investment firm maintained that wage gains were unlikely to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target in the near term but cautioned that the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data would be crucial in determining inflation's trajectory. A surge in immigration had contributed to easing wage inflation, according to the financial firm's report, but the long-term labor supply trend would influence the Fed’s ability to adjust rates.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. Latest reports indicate that OpenAI, the generative artificial intelligence startup backed by Microsoft,  has crossed the 1 million paid users barrier in the ChatGPT for business section. OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022 to kickstart the AI boom. The tech giant has invested more than $10 billion in the AI startup already, and is potentially considering another large investment, along with Apple and NVIDIA, as the valuation of the startup touches close to $100 billion. OpenAI is considering higher-priced subscriptions to ChatGPT, perhaps $2,000 per month, as it launches new models like Strawberry and Orion.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was recently added to the Signature Picks list of investment advisory Wells Fargo. The advisory has an Overweight rating on the shares with a $515 price target. In an investor note, the advisory detailed that Microsoft was a leader and share gainer in cloud infrastructure and was positioned to benefit from a significant artificial intelligence-enabled product cycle forming. It added that there was a favorable setup ahead for the tech giant, as incremental server supply coming online would drive an Azure growth reacceleration in the second half of 2024.
Overall MSFT ranks 4th on our list of the most important AI stocks according to BlackRock. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

107,2024-09-25 02:18:10+00:00,Jim Cramer Reports That ‘Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is Joining BlackRock And Other Companies To Raise $100 Billion To Develop Data Centers For AI And The Energy Infrastructure To Power Them’,  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Reveals 12 Stocks Investors Should Monitor Closely. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer.
In a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed the current state of the economy, noting that there are essentially two separate economies at play. One economy is struggling with higher interest rates, making it harder for businesses and individuals to thrive, while the other seems unaffected by these rates. This division explains why, even after a double rate cut, the stock market, including the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq, still experienced declines.
""There really are two economies in this country. There's one that needs lower interest rates because business is slowing and it's harder to find a job, and then there's another that says we don't really care about where the rates are. That's how we can get a double rate cut today and still see the Dow dipping 103 points, the S&P declining 29 points, and the Nasdaq shedding 31 points.""
Jim Cramer highlights that many companies, especially retailers and restaurants serving low-income customers, are worried about high interest rates and needed the recent double rate cut to improve their forecasts. While this cut benefits the housing and industrial sectors, which initially rose in stock prices before selling off, the tech sector in Silicon Valley remains largely unaffected. Cramer describes tech leaders as having escaped the constraints of interest rates, focusing on innovation and catering to businesses rather than consumers. Their success relies more on their ability to innovate than on interest rate fluctuations.
""There are so many companies I talk to that truly worry about the economy and say they can't make their forecasts because rates are too high. We've been hearing that from most retailers and restaurants, especially those that cater to the less well-off. They needed this double rate cut—believe me. It's great for housing, and it can help the industrials; those stocks ran in anticipation and sold off when we got what we wanted. That is a very typical action.
Additionally, he explains that tech companies are not selling everyday goods like homes, washing machines, or cars. Unlike housing, which relies on lower mortgage rates to boost sales, the tech sector focuses on creating software that simplifies the home-buying process. While lower rates can encourage new businesses, many startups are too small to need extensive software solutions.
""You see, these tech companies aren't selling homes; they aren't selling washing machines or cars or steel or plastic—things worth less than a dollar that are sold for more than a dollar at a dollar store. Housing, of course, needs lower mortgage rates to get sales going. Tech doesn't care about mortgage rates; they just want to create software that reduces some of the friction you encounter in the process of buying a home. Lower rates make it more likely that people start new companies, but most new companies are too small to need major enterprise software. Companies we talk to can see small-cap companies go up, but big enterprise software? Not so much.""
Cramer notes that the Federal Reserve cut rates to help control inflation, which benefits more businesses overall. However, in the tech industry, the focus is on increasing efficiency through automation, often resulting in fewer employees. These tech companies aim to avoid being affected by the Fed's decisions because relying on them would indicate weakness and vulnerability to the economic cycle, which they actively seek to evade.
""The Fed wanted to be sure that inflation is contained and going in the right direction, which then allowed them to relent and cut by 50 basis points. Now, more businesses in the East can thrive, but out here, the presumption is that all enterprises are trying to raise margins, often by automating everything that can be automated, which means using fewer people. These tech companies are automators; they never want to be hostage to the Fed. They don't want you to be hostage to the Fed because that would be a sign of weakness—a sign of cyclicality. Oh, they hate cyclicality. Why be hostage to the business cycle if you don't have to?""
Finally, Jim Cramer emphasizes that many people see artificial intelligence as a key player in today's market. Companies that leverage AI can improve their profit margins, which boosts earnings even if their overall sales are declining. This means that even without increasing sales, AI can help businesses become more profitable.

Jim Cramer reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is collaborating with
BlackRock, Inc.
(NYSE:BLK) and other companies to raise $100 billion aimed at developing data centers for AI and the necessary energy infrastructure. This initiative called the Global Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP), is initially focused on raising $30 billion to support both new and existing data centers.
""Microsoft, meanwhile, is joining BlackRock and other companies to raise $100 billion to develop data centers for AI and the energy infrastructure to power them. The Global Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Investment Partnership, or GAIIP, is initially looking to raise $30 billion for new and existing data centers.""
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s positive outlook is supported by strong Q2 2024 earnings, with total revenue of $59 billion, a 15% increase from last year, and a net income of $21 billion, indicating healthy profit margins. A key factor in this growth is the cloud services segment, especially Azure, which experienced a 25% revenue increase, reinforcing Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s leadership in the cloud market.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s hybrid cloud strategy and seamless integration of Azure with other Microsoft products give it a competitive edge. Additionally, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s significant investments in artificial intelligence, including its partnership with OpenAI and new AI features in Microsoft 365 and Azure, position it well for future growth as demand for AI tools rises.
The ongoing popularity of Office 365 among businesses and consumers ensures steady subscription revenue, while the gaming division, boosted by initiatives like Xbox Game Pass and the acquisition of
Activision Blizzard, Inc.
(NASDAQ:ATVI), is expected to drive further engagement and revenue. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s commitment to sustainability, with ambitious goals for carbon neutrality and renewable energy, appeals to modern consumers and investors, enhancing its brand reputation.
Overall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

",2024-09,we recently compiled a list of the jim cramer reveals stocks investors should monitor closely in this article we are going to take a look at where microsoft corporation nasdaqmsft stands against the other stocks that should be monitored closely according to jim cramer in a recent episode of mad money jim cramer discussed the current state of the economy noting that there are essentially two separate economies at play one economy is struggling with higher interest rates making it harder for businesses and individuals to thrive while the other seems unaffected by these rates this division explains why even after a double rate cut the stock market including the dow sp and nasdaq still experienced declines there really are two economies in this country theres one that needs lower interest rates because business is slowing and its harder to find a job and then theres another that says we dont really care about where the rates are thats how we can get a double rate cut today and still see the dow dipping points the sp declining points and the nasdaq shedding points jim cramer highlights that many companies especially retailers and restaurants serving lowincome customers are worried about high interest rates and needed the recent double rate cut to improve their forecasts while this cut benefits the housing and industrial sectors which initially rose in stock prices before selling off the tech sector in silicon valley remains largely unaffected cramer describes tech leaders as having escaped the constraints of interest rates focusing on innovation and catering to businesses rather than consumers their success relies more on their ability to innovate than on interest rate fluctuations there are so many companies i talk to that truly worry about the economy and say they cant make their forecasts because rates are too high weve been hearing that from most retailers and restaurants especially those that cater to the less welloff they needed this double rate cutbelieve me its great for housing and it can help the industrials those stocks ran in anticipation and sold off when we got what we wanted that is a very typical action additionally he explains that tech companies are not selling everyday goods like homes washing machines or cars unlike housing which relies on lower mortgage rates to boost sales the tech sector focuses on creating software that simplifies the homebuying process while lower rates can encourage new businesses many startups are too small to need extensive software solutions you see these tech companies arent selling homes they arent selling washing machines or cars or steel or plasticthings worth less than a dollar that are sold for more than a dollar at a dollar store housing of course needs lower

108,2024-07-30 03:56:28+00:00,"Wedbush: Microsoft earnings to reveal big cloud, AI momentum",Investing.com ,"Microsoft is set to announce its fiscal Q4 2024 financial results on July 30, after the market close, a report that will be closely watched by the market for insights into AI adoption rates.
Wedbush analysts maintained an Outperform rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock ahead of the release, keeping it on their Best Ideas List.
""Our checks for Microsoft have been robust this quarter again as we believe the AI tidal wave with Redmond in the driver's seat is accelerating cloud deal flow for Azure with strong momentum into the rest of 2024/2025,” they said in a note.
The investment firm expects a strong performance for the June quarter, with Microsoft projected to surpass the consensus estimates of $64.37 billion in revenue and $2.93 in earnings per share (EPS).
Wedbush believes that the Intelligent Cloud is likely to be a key area of upside. The most critical metric will be Azure growth, with the Street's target set at 30%, a figure analysts think Microsoft can exceed given the high level of deal activity from its core enterprise customers.
“We strongly view this as Microsoft's ""iPhone Moment"" with AI set to change the cloud growth trajectory in Redmond the next few years and recent checks giving further confidence in this dynamic,” analysts noted.
Their research indicates that over the next three years, more than 70% of Microsoft's installed base will adopt AI-driven functionality, fundamentally altering the landscape for the company.
Analysts believe the stock has yet to fully reflect the anticipated wave of cloud and AI growth, as enterprise AI use cases are expected to drive more budget allocations toward AI in 2024/2025. Citing their partner checks around Copilot deployments, Wedbush notes that this could add an additional $25 billion to Microsoft's top line by the fiscal year 2025 (FY25).
Furthermore, the firm estimates that for every $100 spent on Azure cloud services in recent years, there will be an additional $40 allocated to AI spending moving forward.
Wedbush's thesis remains that the cloud, along with the Office 365/Windows ecosystem, will constitute a larger portion of Microsoft's revenue, driving accelerated growth and margins into FY25.

109,2024-05-05 13:01:19+00:00,Here's Why We Think Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Might Deserve Your Attention Today,  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ,"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.
So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.
 View our latest analysis for Microsoft 
If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Microsoft managed to grow EPS by 16% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The music to the ears of Microsoft shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 41% to 45% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.
In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.
Fortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Microsoft's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.
Owing to the size of Microsoft, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.0b. This comes in at 0.03% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.
One important encouraging feature of Microsoft is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Still, you should learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Microsoft.
There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases.

110,2024-06-07 13:32:48+00:00,Why Microsoft is Among Dan Loeb’s Top Growth Stock Picks,  Omer Farooq ,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb and in this article we will discuss the activist investor's position in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).
Billionaire investor Dan Loeb's hedge fund Third Point had a strong start to 2024 after its offshore fund posted returns of 7.8% in the first quarter chugging along with the broader market's 10.6% gain. AI has been one of his top investing themes for some time now and the activist shareholder maintains his bullish view on the technology. In the first quarter, he initiated a position in Alphabet and also increased his position in Amazon by 22% to about $920 million.
Loeb's also bullish on the energy transition and one of his favorite stocks that is expected to benefit from the AI-driven electricity demand is Vistra, one of the largest independent power producers and retail electricity providers in the US. Though Vistra's core markets have experienced volatility due to weak domestic electricity demand, the power company's ""capital allocation strategy has been brilliant"", he stated in his Q1 2024 letter to shareholders, seen by Insider Monkey. In the weak demand environment for fossil fuels, Vistra made smart moves by shutting down its unprofitable coal plants and instead buying back 33% of its shares between 2018 and 2023. Additionally, its acquisition of nuclear generation assets of Ohio-based energy company, Energy Harbor, was right on time as governments are turning to nuclear fuel sources to meet the world's growing energy demands. Loeb expects Vistra to be a direct beneficiary of AI-driven electricity demand and is bullish on the company's unique position of holding both renewable and fossil fuel-based assets under its belt.
Another AI play Loeb is increasingly bullish on is UK-based stock exchange and financial data company London Stock Exchange Group. The activist investor likes the company's unique market position as a data provider that is democratizing and making financial data accessible to consumers without the use of additional third-party software. He sees London Stock Exchange Group benefitting from generative AI as information retrieval systems in financial services become more powerful. He also expects the company to develop ""a powerful Research Assistant application"" with Microsoft to reduce both human resources and time needed to process financial data. He thinks London Stock Exchange Group is at the forefront of capitalizing on the transition of the financial services industry ""from manual data processing via clunky desktop terminals to machine-assisted data processing"".

111,2024-07-29 23:31:00+00:00,Will Cloud Results Boost Microsoft and Amazon?,  Derek Lewis ,"The 2024 Q2 earnings season picks up considerable steam this week, with a notably busy reporting docket. We’ll hear from many different companies, a list that includes several cloud computing players such as Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN.
Both stocks have been sensitive to their cloud results, often dictating the post-earnings move. We already heard from another notable cloud player, Alphabet GOOGL, and the results provided some insight into what to expect from MSFT and AMZN. Let’s take a closer look.
Alphabet’s quarterly release was overall positive. The company enjoyed 31% EPS growth on nearly 14% higher sales. Both figures exceeded our consensus expectations, building on its recent streak of quarterly positivity.
Cloud showed great growth, with revenues of $10.3 billion nearly 30% higher year-over-year and reflecting a quarterly record. In addition, operating income from Google Cloud saw a sizable jump, reported at $900 million vs. $191 million in the year-ago period.
Overall, the results were positive, but shares faced pressure following the release due to some uncertainty about AI CapEx. Alphabet has regularly exceeded our consensus cloud expectations as of late, as shown below.

Cloud revenue growth of 23% year-over-year positively shocked investors in its latest release, showing stabilization after a few periods of slowing growth rates. Earnings and revenue expectations have overall remained stable over recent months, with the company expected to enjoy 8% EPS growth on 14% higher sales.
Recent cloud results from the company have consistently exceeded our consensus expectations, as shown below. For the upcoming release, the $28.7 billion estimate suggests a 20% climb from the year-ago period.

AWS delivered great results in the company’s latest period, with net sales of $25 billion showing 17% year-over-year growth and snapping a recent streak of negative surprises on the metric. For the upcoming print, the Zacks Consensus estimate for Cloud revenue stands at $25.9 billion, reflecting a 17.2% Y/Y climb.

Earnings and revenue expectations for the upcoming release have primarily been muted, but big growth is expected, with EPS expected to be up 63% on 10% higher sales. Easing costs and operational efficiencies have aided profitability in a big way, leading to meaningful margin expansion.

Several major cloud players report this week, a list that includes Mag 7 members Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT. Google parent Alphabet GOOGL recently unveiled its cloud results, which were overall positive and showed great growth.
Investors will undoubtedly be laser-focused on the Y/Y growth rates these cloud businesses will post, as a deceleration could cause some spooks. On the flip side, better-than-expected growth could easily usher in post-earnings positivity, though other metrics will also be in focus.

112,2024-05-21 15:30:44+00:00,"Microsoft unveils GPT-4o for Azure, new AI apps in fight against Google, Amazon", Daniel Howley    · Technology Editor,"Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday debuted a host of new AI features during its Build conference in Seattle, including OpenAI’s new GPT-4o, a trio of small language models, and Microsoft’s new Cobalt 100 CPU.
The announcements come as Silicon Valley turbocharges its AI investments and tech giants like Microsoft, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) race to outmaneuver one another during the biggest tech scramble in years.
Microsoft offering OpenAI’s GPT-4o through its Azure AI Studio was the company's biggest announcement on Tuesday.
The model, which OpenAI debuted during a live-streamed event last week, is multimodal and can understand inputs via text, audio, and video. That demo has since become embroiled in controversy after actress Scarlett Johansson on Monday demanded the company change the voice of its chatbot, which OpenAI featured answering questions.
Microsoft’s news also comes a week after Google debuted a slew of AI products during its I/O developers conference, including a new version of Google Search with generative AI-based responses to users’ queries.
Microsoft said users will now be able to develop their own copilots — essentially AI-powered programs — using GPT-4o to make apps that can respond to images, voice, and text. The Windows maker also said it will make its preview of Copilot in Azure available to all customers in the next couple of weeks.
Microsoft also showed off its Phi-3-small, Phi-3-medium, and Phi-3-vision small language models. Designed to run on devices, the Phi-3 models don’t need to connect to the web, allowing users to access them in environments where they otherwise wouldn’t be able to run cloud-based models like GPT-4o.
Phi-3-vision is especially interesting, as it allows users to input images and text and then receive information about them via text outputs. So, for example, users will be able to do things like ask questions about charts, graphs, or images without needing to jump online.
Microsoft 365 is also getting copilot upgrades, with Copilot for Microsoft 365’s new Team Copilot. The app, Microsoft says, can manage meeting agendas and take notes, summarize Teams chats and answer questions related to those conversations. The app can also track user deadlines and notify individual team members when they need to take action.
In addition to new software and developer capabilities, Microsoft also said it will begin previewing Azure virtual machines running on the company’s new Arm-based Cobalt 100 cloud CPUs.
Virtual machines are basically software-simulated versions of computers. So, instead of having to run 50 individual desktops, you can run 50 virtual machines on a high-powered server.
Microsoft claims that its Cobalt 100 chip provides 40% better performance than prior ARM-based virtual machine systems. In addition to the Cobalt 100 CPU, the company says it will begin offering AMD’s (AMD) MI300X chip for developers looking to train and deploy AI apps.
All of this is part of Microsoft’s effort to continue growing its cloud business through AI apps. Google and Amazon are using a similar strategy to expand their respective cloud empires as well, but Microsoft's multibillion-dollar investment in partner OpenAI has helped catapult the company to the top of the AI discussion.
In its most recent quarter, Microsoft said its AI products contributed 7 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue. That was up from 6 percentage points in the prior quarter.
A year ago, Microsoft first broke out its AI percentage contributions to Azure, saying it added 1 percentage point to Azure revenue at the time.

113,2024-06-06 05:00:04+00:00,"US Probes Microsoft’s Deal With AI Firm Inflection, WSJ Says",  Edwin Chan ,"(Bloomberg) -- US regulators are investigating whether a deal Microsoft Corp. struck with AI startup Inflection may have been structured to avoid scrutiny, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.

Microsoft in March agreed to pay the startup $650 million to license its AI software, after the US company moved to hire much of Inflection’s staff. The Federal Trade Commission is now seeking information about how they negotiated that partnership, the Journal reported. The unusual deal resembled an “acqui-hire” — where big companies take over startups mostly for their employees — but without an acquisition. Legal and industry experts at the time suggested Microsoft’s Inflection deal may trigger regulatory concerns.
The news coincides with heightened scrutiny over the players in artificial intelligence, a technology with the potential to transform economies and industries. The Justice Department has said it will step up its focus on competition in the AI sector, as Big Tech plows billions of dollars into developing ChatGPT-like services.
Representatives for Microsoft, Inflection and the FTC weren’t immediately available for comment after normal hours.
The Biden administration’s antitrust agencies are already pursuing cases against some of the world’s largest technology companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. Going forward, the Justice Department and the FTC have agreed to divvy up responsibilities for investigating Nvidia Corp., OpenAI and Microsoft, the New York Times reported separately.
Among other things, watchdog agencies are scrutinizing the dependency of the most popular AI startups on established tech companies for financing and infrastructure.
Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. The drama around the ouster and reinstatement of OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman in November unearthed how closely knit Microsoft and the company have become.
The relationship has drawn scrutiny from antitrust authorities in the UK and the European Union. In January, the FTC said it was looking into Microsoft’s investment, along with others made by Amazon and Alphabet.

115,2024-05-30 08:43:35+00:00,HP CEO on AI PCs and the Microsoft Windows refresh cycle, Brian Sozzi    · Executive Editor,"A few catalysts are coming into play for computer giant HP Inc. (HPQ): the AI PC and the Windows refresh cycle.
HP's fiscal second quarter stabilized a bit from a lackluster showing in the preceding quarter, the company reported Wednesday afternoon.
The company's sales increased in its personal systems segment due to commercial clients upgrading their computers ahead of Microsoft ending support for Windows 10 in October 2025.
HP CEO Enrique Lores told Yahoo Finance that the upgrade cycle fueled stronger-than-expected PC demand by businesses.
Companies are also upgrading units still in use from the pandemic.
""The installed base has aged, and now people, both small companies and large companies, realize that they need to change that,"" Lores explained.
Sales and units of HP's personal computers fell in the quarter.
Printer sales continued to be a tough business amid pricing pressure from Japanese competitors such as Canon.
Sales of consumer printers declined 16%, with commercial sales off by 12%.
The coming AI PC could potentially brighten the earnings for companies like HP and rival Dell (DELL).
Earlier in May, HP unveiled its AI PCs, the HP OmniBook X AI and the HP EliteBook Ultra AI. Both computers have much faster processors to better handle AI-related applications such as Microsoft's (MSFT) Copilot features and OpenAI prompts.
Around the same time, Dell took the wraps off five new AI-centric computers.
Lores says about 10% of PCs sold in 2024 will be of the AI variety, ramping to 60% in three years.
""We continue to think HPQ remains well positioned to benefit from the PC upcycle, which should only accelerate in the second half and in FY25. While Print remains a drag, and Print EBIT margins are expected to be flat to down quarter over quarter in Q3, this should be somewhat offset by cost savings actions, sequential hardware growth in Q4, and upside from personal systems,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani in a client note.
HP stock rose 3% in premarket trading on Thursday.
Net sales: $12.8 billion (-0.8% year over year) vs. $12.6 billion estimate
Personal systems sales: $8.4 billion (3% year over year) vs. $8.28 billion estimate
Printers sales: $4.4 billion (-8% year over year) vs. $4.38 billion estimate
Diluted EPS: $0.82 (+4% year over year) vs. $0.81 estimate (guidance: $0.76-$0.86)
Fiscal third quarter EPS guidance: $0.78 to $0.92 vs. $0.85 estimate
Full-year EPS guidance: $3.30 to $3.60 vs. $3.42 estimate (previous guidance: $3.25)

118,2024-07-04 03:31:57+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Why Are Hedge Funds Bullish on This AI Story Right Now?,  Maleha Afzal ,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stories.
China and the United States continue to compete against each other as the AI boom continues to reign in the tech industry. On July 2, Reuters reported that China plans to develop 50 new national and industrial standards for artificial intelligence by 2026. The country aims to standardize systems in the artificial intelligence sector by providing thorough guidelines to companies and budding startups. Furthermore, on July 3, Reuters reported that China filed six times more patents than the United States for inventions in AI like chatbots. On a global scale, more than 50,000 patent applications were filed in the past decade, a quarter of which were filed in 2023 alone. China filed 38,000 generative AI applications between 2014 and 2023, while the United States only filed slightly over 6,200 applications during the same period. Of the total applications, ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft filed the largest number of applications. The report added that Chinese patent applications covered a wider range of sectors such as autonomous driving, publishing, and document management. South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.
The United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.
While the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.
On June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.
In another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.
Anthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.
Claude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.

The company's efforts in AI do not end here. Two weeks ago, on June 17, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced its efforts to empower scientists with AI-augmented scientific discoveries at companies like Unilever. Its Azure Quantum Elements platform is a groundbreaking addition to Microsoft's suite of AI products. The platform offers two distinct capabilities including Generative Chemistry and Accelerated DTF. The platform is capable of exploring novel molecular structures at groundbreaking speed and scale. Moreover, it can also dissect and simulate chemical and molecular structures. The platform will be able to expedite chemical research, compressing 250 years of research to only 25.

On June 21, Citigroup maintained a buy rating on the stock and increased its price target from $495 to $520.

The company’s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all sizes.

119,2024-10-03 16:51:23+00:00,The US and Microsoft disrupt a Russian hacking group targeting American officials and nonprofits,  DAVID KLEPPER ,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A hacking group tied to Russian intelligence tried to worm its way into the systems of dozens of Western think tanks, journalists and former military and intelligence officials, Microsoft (MSFT) and U.S. authorities said Thursday.
The group, known as Star Blizzard to cyberespionage experts, targeted its victims with emails that appeared to come from a trusted source — a tactic known as spear phishing. In fact, the emails sought access to the victims' internal systems, as a way to steal information and disrupt their activities.
Star Blizzard's actions were persistent and sophisticated, according to Microsoft, and the group often did detailed research on its targets before launching an attack. Star Blizzard also went after civil society groups, U.S. companies, American military contractors and the Department of Energy, which oversees many nuclear programs, the company said.
On Thursday, a U.S. court unsealed documents authorizing Microsoft and the Department of Justice to seize more than 100 website domain names associated with Star Blizzard. That action came after a lawsuit was filed against the network by Microsoft and the NGO-Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a nonprofit tech organization that investigated Star Blizzard.
Authorities haven't gone into details about Star Blizzard's effectiveness but said they expect Russia to keep deploying hacking and cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies.
“The Russian government ran this scheme to steal Americans’ sensitive information, using seemingly legitimate email accounts to trick victims into revealing account credentials,"" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in announcing the U.S. actions against Star Blizzard. ""With the continued support of our private sector partners, we will be relentless in exposing Russian actors and cybercriminals and depriving them of the tools of their illicit trade.”
Star Blizzard has been linked to Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB. Last year, British authorities accused the group of mounting a yearslong cyberespionage campaign against U.K. lawmakers. Microsoft said it has been tracking the group's activities since 2017.
Microsoft said it observed Star Blizzard attempt dozens of hacking efforts targeting 30 different groups since January 2023. The tech giant's cybersecurity experts say Star Blizzard has proven to be especially elusive.
“Star Blizzard’s ability to adapt and obfuscate its identity presents a continuing challenge for cybersecurity professionals,” the company wrote in a report on its findings.
U.S. authorities charged two Russian men last year in connection with Star Blizzard's past actions. Both are believed to be in Russia.
Along with American targets, Star Blizzard went after people and groups throughout Europe and in other NATO countries. Many had supported Ukraine following Russia's invasion.
A message left with the Russian Embassy in Washington was not immediately returned Thursday.

120,2024-08-05 13:00:20+00:00,"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) sheds 4.3% this week, as yearly returns fall more in line with earnings growth",  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ,"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shareholders have seen the share price descend 13% over the month. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. Indeed, the share price is up an impressive 201% in that time. So while it's never fun to see a share price fall, it's important to look at a longer time horizon. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.
Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 4.3%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price.
 See our latest analysis for Microsoft 
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Over half a decade, Microsoft managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 25% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
We know that Microsoft has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Microsoft's TSR for the last 5 years was 215%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
We're pleased to report that Microsoft shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 25% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 26% a year, is even better. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Microsoft  that you should be aware of.
For those who like to find winning investments this free list of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.

Microsoft Corporation price-eps-surprise | Microsoft Corporation Quote
Microsoft is witnessing robust demand for its cloud infrastructure monitoring, web-based application performance management and human capital management solutions. This demand is fueled by the increasing migration of workloads to the cloud.During the fiscal second quarter, Azure and other cloud services revenues grew 30% (up 28% at cc), including roughly 6 points from AI services, which was higher than the previous quarter's 29% (28% at cc). In Azure, Microsoft expects revenue growth at cc to remain stable in the fiscal third quarter, with increasing contributions from all Azure AI services.

125,2024-09-10 21:45:37+00:00,Why Microsoft Stock Topped the Market Today,"  Eric Volkman, The Motley Fool ","News in the cooling-but-still-hot artificial intelligence (AI) sphere helped Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock land in positive territory on Tuesday. The tech sector giant's share price improved by more than 2% across the trading session thanks to that news, which came from a private company in which it's heavily invested. By comparison, the S&P 500 index could only manage a 0.5% increase on the day.
On Tuesday, tech industry website The Information, citing two unidentified people who have tested the goods, reported that OpenAI aims to release its latest product within the next two weeks. That product, called Strawberry, is a reasoning-focused set of artificial intelligence (AI) functionalities developed by the high-profile specialist in the technology.
OpenAI is the developer of ChatGPT, the very high-profile AI program that is something of an early flagship for the tech. Microsoft has committed to invest a reported $13 billion in the still privately held business; with that, it is essentially considered by many to be something of a benefactor for OpenAI. Microsoft has ambitious plans to integrate AI functionalities and services into most of its software products.
Neither Microsoft nor OpenAI has yet commented on the report, which was widely disseminated throughout tech media after publication.
Both OpenAI and Microsoft are impatient and vastly ambitious, so The Information's report is entirely plausible. If proven accurate, it will surely be a plus for Microsoft, placing it on the cutting edge of an advanced technology. The trick will be to stay there; so far, it seems OpenAI management has been quite effective at setting the pace in the great AI race.

128,2024-10-07 20:54:15+00:00,Is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) the Best AI Stock to Buy?,  Attiya Zainib ,"We recently published a list of Top 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Now. Since Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.
Following the aggressive rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the market roared to new highs but quickly lost enthusiasm as investors look for clues on what might be ailing the economy that pushed the Fed to go more dovish than expected. However, others think the bull market is going to continue.
BMO Capital’s Brian Belsk has raised the S&P 500 target for 2024 to 6,100 from 5,600. Talking to CNBC in a latest program, Belsk said the “resiliency” of this bull market is “undoubted.”
The analyst said that the stock market is going higher through the end of this year.
“We do believe that the Fed is doing a great job. We believe the Fed that we are not hitting into a recession. We believe the Fed that we are heading into more of a soft landing,” the analyst said.
Belsk thinks we are in the “1995-1996 environment” where we can “handle” the 24x earnings multiple.
The analyst added that the Mag. 7 stocks underperformed the market in the third quarter and yet the broader market grew, which shows the market rally is broad.
For this article we chose 10 AI stocks trending on the back of latest news, earnings and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 279
Ankur Crawford, Alger executive VP, while talking to CNBC in a latest program said that in about 3 to 5 years AI is going to provide us with superhuman intelligence.
“All of the CapEx being spent today is whole-heartedly justifiable because the opportunity to monetize that AI by that time is beyond what anyone has contemplated in the market so far.”
Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the top AI picks of Ankur Crawford.
Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares fell following its quarterly results which showed the company’s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.
But what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office’s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year’s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year’s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year’s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.
While Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and would bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year’s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.
Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft’s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure’s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.”
Overall, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Now. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

136,2024-06-11 12:00:32+00:00,When Should You Buy Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)?,  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ,"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$431 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$389. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Microsoft's current trading price of US$428 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Microsoft’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
 See our latest analysis for Microsoft 
The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 1.05% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microsoft today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $423.43, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. In addition to this, Microsoft has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 53% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Microsoft. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MSFT’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?
Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MSFT, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.
So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Microsoft you should be aware of.

138,2024-06-17 14:00:01+00:00,Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution,  Lucas Wong ,"With a market capitalization of approximately $3 trillion, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) holds the title of the largest publicly traded company globally. Following its acquisition of OpenAI, the software giant has aggressively expanded its customer base and significantly enhanced its overall performance. The company's shares have surged in recent quarters, surpassing expectations and delivering substantial returns. I expect this trend to persist, as Microsoft continues to lead in the artificial intelligence space and invest heavily in new AI initiatives, building on the success achieved with OpenAI.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.

Microsoft has strategically positioned itself ahead of its competitors through massive research and development spending, large acquisitions and strategic partnerships with external companies. These maneuvers have provided the company with a competitive edge, enabling it to outshine rivals and roll out AI services to end users more quickly and effectively. The intensifying competition between Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) updated Gemini and OpenAI's flagship GPT-4 underscores the evolving landscape of generative AI. As more multi-modal interactive platforms are launched, it is clear we are witnessing a three-horse race in the generative AI arena. Microsoft is likely to benefit temporarily from its early investments in OpenAI, solidifying its position as a leader in the field.
Microsoft is actively deploying AI-as-a-service features on its Azure cloud computing platform, which has become one of the company's largest revenue generators, surpassing even its Office software suite. The launch of Azure in 2010 marked a pivotal change in the company's revenue trajectory. Seven years post-launch, it saw significant revenue jumps, largely driven by the success of Azure. This trend continues today, with Microsoft's cloud computing services contributing substantially to its financial growth.
Figure 2: Azure has been the key driver of Microsoft's revenue growth

Given Azure's significant contribution to Microsoft's revenue, it is crucial for the company to continuously attract new customers to sustain the expected growth. Microsoft is well-positioned to achieve this, as evidenced by Azure's capture of 25% of the cloud market, even as Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS has seen a slight decline in market share. The ongoing cloud super-cycle and the generative AI boom have been key factors in Azure's growing market share, which now stands at 25%, gradually closing the gap with AWS, which holds 31%.

With the increasing demand for cloud services and AI capabilities, Microsoft is poised to continue exceeding market expectations. Azure's robust performance and strategic advancements ensure it remains a critical component of the company's overall success, reinforcing its leadership in the rapidly evolving cloud and AI industries.
Microsoft made headlines with its substantial acquisition of a significant stake in OpenAI back in 2019, initially investing $1 billion. Since then, the company has invested an additional $10 billion into this partnership. Beyond this major investment, it has also made several other notable investments in cloud computing and AI in recent months.
Just in the past two months, Microsoft announced a series of strategic investments: $2.9 billion in Japan to open a research center in Tokyo, $1.5 billion in the United Arab Emirates for a stake in AI company G42 and infrastructure and $3.3 billion in Wisconsin to build a manufacturing-focused AI research lab, among others. More recently, the company announced it they will invest $3.2 billion to expand its cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure in Sweden over a two-year period. Additionally, Microsoft's venture capital fund, M12, has taken positions in several private AI companies. One of the most notable moves was a $650 million stake in Inflection AI, co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Suleyman, a prominent figure in the AI space, is now the head of AI at Microsoft.

Souce: Bloomberg
With the generative AI market expected to exceed $1 trillion in value within the next decade and global IT spending is forecasted to grow at 8% this year, Microsoft is well-positioned to scale its business significantly. These strategic investments provide the company with numerous catalysts to drive growth and solidify its leadership in the AI industry for the foreseeable future.
In its earnings report for the third quarter of 2024, which was released last month, Microsoft reported a remarkable 17.1% year-over-year increase in revenue, reaching $61.90 billion. The company's GAAP earnings per share were $2.94. The operating margin expanded significantly from 42.30% to 44.60%, demonstrating substantial improvement for a company of its scale. This growth was achieved despite costs associated with the acquisition of Activision and an accounting change related to the useful life and depreciation of certain data center equipment. Both the top-line and bottom-line results exceeded expectations.
Figure 5: Third-quarter earnings summary

A key driver of this performance was the accelerating growth of the Intelligent Cloud segment, Microsoft's largest and fastest-growing business, which saw a 21% year-over-year increase to $26.70 billion, with operating margins expanding to 46.80% (up 4 points). Additionally, search and news advertising revenue grew by 3.30% year over year to $3.13 billion, aided by the market share gains of OpenAI-powered Bing, which reached 3.64% of the search engine market as of April 2024. As a result of these strong performances, Microsoft's quarterly levered free cash flow increased from $13.50 billion to $16.90 billion, despite a $4.30 billion increase in capital expenditures.
Figure 6: Intelligent Cloud segment revenue and operating income performance

Revenue growth is crucial for Microsoft's future success, particularly as the costs of training new AI models and improving Azure, its primary AI delivery method, continue to rise. The company has demonstrated robust growth over the past few years, with mid-teens growth in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2024, Microsoft is expected to continue exceeding expectations, with projected revenue of $64.40 billion, indicating 14.60% year over year expected growth. Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to grow from $2.69 to $2.93, reflecting improved operating leverage. A significant driver of this growth is its flagship AI product, Copilot, which has been instrumental in scaling subscriptions and generating sales. As Copilot gains traction, Microsoft has announced new functions for its AI assistant, which could create new streams of recurring revenue. Additionally, the integration of GPT-4o into Bing is expected to attract more users and expand Microsoft's share in the search market. Bing recently captured over 10% of the search market, suggesting that Google's monopoly is being challenged.
According to management guidance, full-year operating margins are expected to increase by over 2 points despite cloud and AI investments, the impact of the Activision acquisition and changes in useful life accounting. This margin expansion highlights Microsoft's efficiency and disciplined cost management, with expectations for continued growth in cloud and AI investments next year, which are high-margin revenue streams. The same trajectory of margin improvement is anticipated into 2025, driven by these factors.
Beyond the impressive revenue and margin figures, Microsoft's free cash flow is a standout financial strength. The company is cash-rich with an $80 billion cash pile supporting its acquisition and talent hiring strategies. Last 12 months free cash flow generation reached $70.57 billion (up 22.90% sequentially), enabling aggressive partnerships and M&A activities, including the recent $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. While there was a reduction last year, the company is on track to outperform and increase its free cash flow this year, providing ample resources for future acquisitions. The gap between cash from operations and free cash flow has widened as management has invested heavily in cloud and AI infrastructure, suggesting that FCF could expand much faster in the medium to long term once the infrastructure build-out is completed.
Figure 7: CFO, FCF and capex progression 
Source: Microsoft Investor Relations
Microsoft has committed substantial resources to research and development and capital expenditures, with last 12-month R&D expenses of $28.19 billion (up 3.20% sequentially) and capital expenditures of $39.54 billion (up 51.9% sequentially). These investments ensure Microsoft remains well-capitalized to pursue growth opportunities. Management's commitment to sustaining momentum in the cloud and AI business is evident from the rapid ramp-up in investments in these areas.
As of the end of the third quarter, Microsoft had $80 billion in cash and short-term investments and $65.44 billion in long-term debt. The company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio stands at 0.60, indicating strong financial health and the ability to pay down its long-term debt efficiently.
Although Microsoft has significant potential upside if its generative AI goals go according to plan, the stock is currently not the most affordable despite being a sensible long-term investment. It is important to note long-term plays often require substantial time to yield returns. Despite the numerous growth catalysts in its favor, the current share price offers little margin of safety to warrant a bullish rating at this juncture. While Microsoft's business has performed exceptionally well and is likely to continue thriving, there are questions about whether it is prudent to purchase shares at the current levels. Various valuation methods indicate that none provide a sufficient margin to justify buying at the current price. Even with aggressive estimates for Microsoft's growth rates, margins and free cash flow generation, it is challenging to justify a long position solely based on fundamentals.
Figure 8: Microsoft's current valuations lack sufficient upside margins

Further, Microsoft might face more intense competition in its AI business from both large companies within the Magnificent Seven and smaller, emerging players. Although the tech company is perceived as an AI leader today, this may not hold true five or 10 years from now. Additionally, economic uncertainties persist, with inflation remaining high and the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates still on the table. Microsoft's substantial spending on building its cloud platform and AI tools could be viewed unfavorably by investors if the economy deteriorates.
Given these factors, I am not assigning a buy rating to Microsoft's shares at the current price. Therefore, I recommend a hold on the stock and will monitor the price action closely. Should there be any negative movements while the current fundamentals persist, it might swing my recommendation to a buy at a lower price.
Microsoft's impressive financial performance, strategic investments in AI and cloud computing and robust growth outlook underscore its potential for long-term success. However, given the current valuation and economic uncertainties, the stock lacks a sufficient margin of safety to justify a bullish rating at present.

139,2024-06-07 19:03:23+00:00,Analysts Think Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is Still The Best AI Stock — Here’s Why,  Fahad Saleem ,"We recently published a list of top 10 AI stocks Wall Street analysts are upgrading. Microsoft ranks higher in the list and deserves a deeper look.
There has been much uproar about AI stock valuations and how investors are overpaying for mega-cap tech stocks that are promising something that still lies far into the future — productivity gains, real-life AI products and AGI. But the market doesn’t seem to care what the AI skeptics and naysayers believe. There seems to be no end in sight to the AI-led gains in stocks. And analysts are expecting more. Goldman Sachs's Scott Rubner recently said that he sees a ""wall of money"" heading towards the market. Rubner pointed towards the whopping $7.3 trillion sitting in money market funds and said he believes the floodgates are about to open and investors would funnel that money into stocks. According to Rubner's model, the third quarter of 2024 is when we should expect billions ($29 billion, to be precise) to be flushed into the market.
One doesn’t need to have a crystal ball to know where all of those billions would be headed. AI is the promising theme everyone is betting on and that everyone includes experts, billionaires, money managers and long-term value investors. Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that investors have been ""hesitant"" for much of the year, but they should just ""stick"" with ""what's working."" AI, weight loss drugs and related themes is what's working these days, according to Lee.

140,2024-08-06 08:17:00+00:00,Stock-Split Watch: Is Microsoft Next?,"  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ","Tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been around for a long time, so it's no stranger to stock splits. The company split its stock nine times from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But since then? Nada. Today, Microsoft stock is trading at over $400 per share. Cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) growth has driven shares to new heights and could continue over the long term.
Perhaps it's time for management to consider a stock split.
What does that mean for investors? Would a stock split make Microsoft a buy?
Here is what you need to know.
The media loves making a big deal out of stock splits. But are they as big a deal as they seem?
First, what is a stock split? A stock split is when a company divides its stock to increase the number of shares. Suppose one share of a company's stock trades at $100. If management did a 5-to-1 split, that single share would become five shares trading at $20 each.
Notice how the value of the investment didn't change. One share at $100 or five at $20 equals the same total. This is very important.
Stock splits divide everything, so each share represents less of the company's revenue, profits, and equity. So, while a stock split creates a lower share price, it's an illusion. The company's fundamental valuation doesn't change.
So why split the stock in the first place? In most cases, it's for liquidity. As a share price rises, it's harder for investors to accumulate shares without having a lot of money. Employees who have earned stock-based compensation might be sitting on significant gains and may not want to sell at high dollar increments. A higher share count and lower share price make it easier for investors and employees to control how much they buy or sell at a time.
You can see that Microsoft split several times between the late 1980s and the early 2000s. That was due to remarkable stock performance; Microsoft gained nearly 60,000% from 1986 to 2000, just before the Dot-Com market crash. Microsoft's stock plunged in the crash and took 17 years to reach the price it traded at in 2000. That's why Microsoft has only split once since 2000.
Microsoft launched its cloud platform Azure in early 2010, sparking a new era for the company. Since then, Microsoft's stock has appreciated 1,400%, and the cloud is its largest and fastest-growing business unit today. A new generation of employees who have been with the company over the years are likely sitting on hefty stock gains.
Azure is already the world's second-leading cloud platform. Microsoft's partnership with leading AI developer OpenAI is poised to funnel AI computing workloads through Azure as companies adopt AI over the coming years.
Microsoft recently reported fourth-quarter earnings for its fiscal year 2024 and topped Wall Street's expectations, fueled by solid momentum in its cloud and gaming businesses. Today, Microsoft stock trades at 32 times its estimated 2025 earnings. Analysts believe earnings per share will grow at an annualized 16% rate for the next three to five years.
Since stock splits don't fundamentally change the stock, investors should never make an investment decision based solely on a stock split. A price-to-earnings ratio double the company's earnings growth percentage isn't cheap, but Microsoft arguably offers a unique combination of quality and upside that's hard to replicate.
Long-term investors may be willing to pay a slight premium to own the stock now, though market volatility could easily present better buying opportunities.

Stock-Split Watch: Is Microsoft Next? was originally published by The Motley Fool
",2024-08,tech giant microsoft nasdaq msft has been around for a long time so its no stranger to stock splits the company split its stock nine times from the late s to the early s but since then nada today microsoft stock is trading at over per share cloud and artificial intelligence ai growth has driven shares to new heights and could continue over the long term perhaps its time for management to consider a stock split what does that mean for investors would a stock split make microsoft a buy here is what you need to know the media loves making a big deal out of stock splits but are they as big a deal as they seem first what is a stock split a stock split is when a company divides its stock to increase the number of shares suppose one share of a companys stock trades at if management did a to split that single share would become five shares trading at each notice how the value of the investment didnt change one share at or five at equals the same total this is very important stock splits divide everything so each share represents less of the companys revenue profits and equity so while a stock split creates a lower share price its an illusion the companys fundamental valuation doesnt change so why split the stock in the first place in most cases its for liquidity as a share price rises its harder for investors to accumulate shares without having a lot of money employees who have earned stockbased compensation might be sitting on significant gains and may not want to sell at high dollar increments a higher share count and lower share price make it easier for investors and employees to control how much they buy or sell at a time you can see that microsoft split several times between the late s and the early s that was due to remarkable stock performance microsoft gained nearly from to just before the dotcom market crash microsofts stock plunged in the crash and took years to reach the price it traded at in thats why microsoft has only split once since microsoft

141,2024-09-15 14:57:50+00:00,Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Set for a Comeback After Recent Stock Declines?,  Debasis Saha ,"We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks For Beginners With Little Money. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks for beginners with little money.
“In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,” believes Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, who is the most successful investor not only in our time but also in human history. Buffett made the remarks at his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway’s 2020 Annual Meeting, but it wasn’t the first time he shared similar thoughts. While most investment advisors and internet stock analysts are likely to boast about ‘chasing the alpha,’ for the Oracle of Omaha, who is currently worth $144.5 billion excluding his charitable donations over the years, most people are better off tracking the S&P.
Buffett has, in fact, held this opinion for years. Speaking to CNBC in 2017, he reiterated that “consistently” buying an index fund linked to the flagship S&P index is “the thing that makes the most sense practically all of the time.” Buffett added that an investor should persist even during the bad times, when the “temptation when you see bad headlines in newspapers is to say, well, maybe I should skip a year or something.” Do not give in, says the Oracle, and “just keep buying” since “American business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe is going to do very well.”
Yet, there’s another temptation that especially beginners to the stock market have to face. This is the rush to ‘alpha’ and by extension, wealth and riches. But according to Buffett, the “trick is not to pick the right company, the trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low cost way,” since “you do not want to ever get the impression that you can pick stocks.” This false belief carries the risk of making a beginner believe that they have an edge over others, while the reality “just doesn’t work that way,” believes Buffett.
However, just because you’re a beginner with little money, doesn’t mean you can’t make it big. Wall Street, despite its flaws, has also produced titans of the investing world who started out with little to nothing. One of the best examples of this fact is Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments. Fisher’s childhood didn’t make him a stranger to Wall Street as his father Philip Fisher is one of the most consequential figures in Wall Street’s history. Fisher Sr. was the original Cathie Wood who popularized growth investing and sought to invest through a strategy called “scuttlebutt investing.”
Fisher Sr. covered this strategy in his seminal work Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits (“one of the great books on investing,” as per Buffett) and shared that an investor should conduct in depth research for a firm by getting to know its executives and employees. While Fisher’s father is a Wall Street legend, Ken started out his firm with just $250 in 1979. As of Q2 2024, the firm had $229 billion in investments as indicated through its SEC filings while Fisher’s net worth is $11.2 billion.
While today’s $250 is far from being similar in value to $250 when Fisher started his investing journey, technology enables today’s beginner investors to invest with even less money. One way to do so, if you’re feeling bold enough to ignore Buffett’s advice against stock picking, is to use fractional shares. Through these, a wide variety of brokerages enable beginners on the stock market to invest in stocks through as little as $1 and any dollar amount via features such as cash quantity stock orders. Fractional investing also enables some of the smallest investors to gain exposure to big ticket stocks, including Berkshire, whose Class B shares have a recent closing share price of $689,287.
Finally, before we get to our list of the best stocks to buy for beginners with little money, another way for a beginner to start out with little money and grow portfolio value over time comes through dividend stocks. These stocks offer beginner investors stable and often regular payouts over the long term. While everyone likes stable income, the true magic of these stocks is the ability to reinvest these dividends to generate even more returns. The benefits of reinvesting dividends are clear when we look at the data. This shows that a $1,000 investment in the benchmark S&P index would be worth $33,500 in 2022 without dividend reinvestment. But if the dividends were reinvestment, the final value nearly triple and would be worth $93,000.

Our Methodology
To make our list of the best stocks to buy for beginners with little money, we first made a list of 20 stocks recommended by the financial media. Then, these were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q2 2024 and the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were selected.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 279
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world and a leader in the enterprise computing space. It has exposure to the voluminous personal computing industry via the Windows platform and enterprise computing through Azure. A software focused business model has also allowed Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to become one of the top global players in artificial intelligence. So much so that since the public reveal of ChatGPT in November 2022, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has invested billions into OpenAI, has seen its stock soar by 83% to its peak in July 2024. However, since AI, and particularly the ability to profit from it through enterprise sales, is now baked into Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock, any weakness in lower market AI adoption or AI monetization will not bode well for the shares. This has been the case since July, as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s shares are down by 14% as the market waits to decide on the macroeconomic outlook and the potential for further AI growth.
Baron Funds mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:
“Microsoft Corporation is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Oice products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Oice 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over- quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year- over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best- positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.”
Overall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the top stocks for beginners on a budget. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

142,2024-05-31 14:00:02+00:00,Microsoft Is Outpacing Apple in Innovation and Growth,  Oliver Rodzianko ,"I last covered Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) in December, and I allocated a buy rating to the stock. At this time, I believe it offers significantly stronger future price return potential and exposure to diversified innovation than Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). I have, therefore, performed deeper research into the structural differences between the two companies. Therefore, this thesis provides a comparative analysis of the two companies to determine which has the highest competitive benefit moving forward.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.
There are distinct differences structurally between Microsoft and Apple, which contribute to why I think Apple may benefit from a slight readjustment at this time toward how Microsoft operates. Consider the following table:
Microsoft
Apple
Structure
Product-based
Function-based
Decisions
Semi-autonomous
Highly centralized
Products
Broad portfolio
Integrated ecosystem
Culture
Matrix structure
Innovation-driven
Segments
Product lines
Functional areas
I am not suggesting Apple become exactly like Microsoft, and in fact, much of what made Apple magical is its highly innovative ecosystem approach. In essence, it has been a culture of innovation since Steve Jobs founded it. However, without his genius, I think a more typical matrix structure would be well-received by shareholders at this time. That should not discount the importance of hiring the best talent for innovation, and I believe Apple has proven it still values this properly through its recent release of the Apple Vision Pro. However, let's not forget this product is nowhere near as revolutionary and popular as the iPhone was.
What Microsoft has going for it is its semi-autonomous divisions, which act as separate entities with their own budgets and resources, allow for a more targeted and efficient allocation of capital. In turn, this can optimize the returns on investment. There is also a greater emphasis on diversification with Microsoft, reducing dependency on single products, markets or brands and spreading out financial risk.
What I think Apple needs now is to balance the innovation it is known for with the financial prudence that has been developed over the long term by Bill Gates (Trades, Portfolio)' Microsoft, which I believe is more inspired by Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) than by the radical creative approach of some other business leaders like Elon Musk and Jobs.
There are several areas that suggest Apple may be lagging behind Microsoft.
First, in fiscal 2023, iPhone sales accounted for approximately 52% of Apple's total revenue. This heavy reliance on a single product made the company vulnerable to market saturation. In contrast, Microsoft's diverse revenue streams, including Office, LinkedIn, Azure, Windows, Surface and Xbox, mitigate this risk.
Microsoft Azure has been a key driver of growth for the company. The product's revenue grew by 27% in fiscal 2023. In contrast, Apple does not dominate the cloud market. It is, therefore, not exposed to the same growth potential.
Further, Apple also has lower research and development spending at this time. In fiscal 2023 it reported its R&D at about 7.80% of its total revenue. The same year, Microsoft reported R&D investments of around 12.80% of its total revenue. As its R&D investments are spread around multiple high-growth areas, this positions Microsoft for potentially higher levels of innovation and long-term growth.
Although Apple is still one of the most valuable companies in the world, its market capitalization growth has been slower compared to Microsoft in recent years. Microsoft has less vulnerability due to its diversified approach and, at this time, its long-term prosperity looks to be stronger.
The company has been conservative with acquisitions, limiting its expansion into new markets. Microsoft, on the other hand, has made several high-profile acquisitions, including LinkedIn, GitHub and Activision Blizzard.
Apple and Microsoft are both strong companies, but the latter is proving itself to be more fiscally prudent, with a nature of strategic acquisitions and diversification, which arguably sustains its moat for longer and builds it wider than Apple's more localized approach.
To begin my comparative value analysis, please consider the following graph, which compares Microsoft and Apple's trailing 12-month price-earnings ratios.
As we can see, Apple is just slightly lower valued than Microsoft at this time. This is arguably justified based on the operations analysis I presented above. The good news is I do not think either company looks overvalued compared to the wider industry:
Current P/E Ratio Without NRI
Microsoft
37
Apple
30
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)
50
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG)
27
Meta (NASDAQ:META)
27
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)
69
In many respects, Apple and Microsoft offer a fair valuation, but Microsoft has much better growth potential. Therefore, I believe Microsoft is the better investment at this time.
Both Microsoft and Apple trade above what I estimate as intrinsic value, which can be elucidated in the following table:

The table does not indicate that both companies are actually overvalued, as the analysis needs to consider the sentiment analysis I performed above. I believe each stock is likely fairly valued. However, Microsoft offers better growth prospects, which significantly improves its outlook in a discounted earnings model.
While this thesis clearly shows I believe Microsoft has a stronger future ahead of it than Apple at this time, there are significant risks that Microsoft is also going to have to navigate. One of the primary downsides that comes with the software company's diversified portfolio approach is that it may struggle with uniformity and integration risks, reducing the effectiveness of its overall ecosystem and potentially having a negative effect on the customer experience. This is what Jobs was clever in developing at Apple. Nonetheless, Microsoft could find its range of high-growth investments has a shorter half-life than a more integrated approach led by pioneering innovators. The issue here is I do not believe Apple has a Jobs equivalent at the helm at this time to continue to cultivate this direction of radical innovation to drive growth.
In addition, many innovators are not in the technology field for the money. In my opinion, the best talents are usually missionaries rather than capital allocators looking to profit from the stock. In essence, Microsoft could attract individuals who are more finance-oriented rather than creative, reducing the long-term magic fostered within the company over time and instead creating a less lucrative environment for technological advancement if it is not careful with how it sets up incentives and values within its culture.
Apple is struggling with Jobs no longer at the helm of the company. In this new era, I believe Apple needs to strategically redirect itself and take some inspiration from the way Microsoft structures itself. Apple could use a more expansive acquisition and investment strategy with an approach similar to a holding company being introduced.
Apple's markets are saturated, and its iPhone accounted for 52% of its total revenue in fiscal 2023. The company had almost half the R&D spend relative to revenue compared to Microsoft that year. Microsoft has a broader portfolio, where its diversification protects shareholder value and exposes investors to higher growth opportunities.
Microsoft performs better than Apple in my discounted earnings analysis, but I believe both companies to be fairly valued at this time. However, for investors seeking higher growth, Microsoft seems to be the stronger long-term investment.
While Microsoft has a clever capital allocation strategy, it must be careful that it does not lose out on the best creative talent and that its customer experience does not suffer as a result of too much diversification and a loss of focus on the importance of ecosystem development.
Microsoft's prudent financial structure, which I believe was inspired by Buffett and adapted for the field of technology, places it in an incredibly strong position moving forward. Its diversified portfolio of investments exposes investors to higher levels of innovation and growth than Apple, in turn giving it a better valuation based on my discounted earnings analyses.

",2024-05,i last covered microsoft corp nasdaqmsft in december and i allocated a buy rating to the stock at this time i believe it offers significantly stronger future price return potential and exposure to diversified innovation than apple inc nasdaqaapl i have therefore performed deeper research into the structural differences between the two companies therefore this thesis provides a comparative analysis of the two companies to determine which has the highest competitive benefit moving forward warning gurufocus has detected warning sign with msft there are distinct differences structurally between microsoft and apple which contribute to why i think apple may benefit from a slight readjustment at this time toward how microsoft operates consider the following table microsoft apple structure productbased functionbased decisions semiautonomous highly centralized products broad portfolio integrated ecosystem culture matrix structure innovationdriven segments product lines functional areas i am not suggesting apple become exactly like microsoft and in fact much of what made apple magical is its highly innovative ecosystem approach in essence it has been a culture of innovation since steve jobs founded it however without his genius i think a more typical matrix structure would be wellreceived by shareholders at this time that should not discount the importance of hiring the best talent for innovation and i believe apple has proven it still values this properly through its recent release of the apple vision pro however lets not forget this product is nowhere near as revolutionary and popular as the iphone was what microsoft has going for it is its semiautonomous divisions which act as separate entities with their own budgets and resources allow for a more targeted and efficient allocation of capital in turn this can optimize the returns on investment there is also a greater emphasis on diversification with microsoft reducing dependency on single products markets or brands and spreading out financial risk what i think apple needs now is to balance the innovation it is known for with the financial prudence that has been developed over the long term by bill gates trades portfolio microsoft which i believe is more inspired by warren buffett trades portfolio than by the radical creative approach of some other business leaders like elon musk and jobs there are several areas that suggest apple may be lagging behind microsoft first in fiscal iphone sales accounted for approximately of apples total revenue this heavy reliance on a single product made the company vulnerable to market saturation in contrast microsofts diverse revenue streams including office linkedin azure windows surface and xbox mitigate this risk microsoft azure has been a key driver of growth for the company the products revenue grew by in fiscal in contrast apple does not dominate the cloud market it is therefore not exposed to the same growth potential further apple also has lower research and development spending at this time in fiscal it reported its rd at about of its total revenue the same year microsoft reported rd investments of around of its total revenue as its rd investments are spread around multiple highgrowth areas this positions microsoft for potentially higher levels of innovation and longterm growth although apple is still one of the most valuable companies in the world its market capitalization growth has been slower compared to microsoft in recent years microsoft has less vulnerability due to its diversified approach and at this time its longterm prosperity looks to be stronger the company has been conservative with acquisitions limiting its expansion into new markets microsoft on the other hand has made several highprofile acquisitions including linkedin github and activision blizzard apple and microsoft are both strong companies but the latter is proving itself to be more fiscally prudent with a nature of strategic acquisitions and diversification which arguably sustains its moat for longer and builds it wider than apples more localized approach to begin my comparative value analysis please consider the following graph which compares microsoft and apples trailing month priceearnings ratios as we can see apple is just slightly lower valued than microsoft at this time this is arguably justified based on the operations analysis i presented above the good news is i do not think either company looks overvalued compared to the wider industry current pe ratio without nri microsoft apple amazon nasdaqamzn alphabet nasdaqgoogl nasdaqgoog meta nasdaqmeta tesla nasdaqtsla in many respects apple and microsoft offer a fair valuation but microsoft has much better growth potential therefore i

143,2024-10-10 15:00:00+00:00,Microsoft expands AI capabilities to shape a healthier future,PR Newswire ,"REDMOND, Wash., Oct. 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- On Thursday, Microsoft Corp. is unveiling several Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare innovations that connect care experiences, enhance team collaboration, empower healthcare workers, and unlock clinical and operational insights.
Through new healthcare AI models in Azure AI Studio, capabilities for healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, the healthcare agent service in Copilot Studio, and an AI-driven nursing workflow solution, Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare is supporting healthcare organizations on every step of their journey toward shaping a healthier future.
""We are at an inflection point where AI breakthroughs are fundamentally changing the way we work and live,"" said Joe Petro, corporate vice president, Healthcare and Life Sciences Solutions and Platforms at Microsoft. ""Across the broader healthcare and life sciences industry, these advancements are dramatically enhancing patient care and also rekindling the joy of practicing medicine for clinicians. Microsoft's AI-powered solutions are helping lead these efforts by streamlining workflows, improving data integration, and utilizing AI to deliver better outcomes for healthcare professionals, researchers and scientists, payors, providers, medtech developers, and ultimately the patients they all serve.""
Expanding the reach of AI beyond text: healthcare AI models in Azure AI Studio 
Microsoft is announcing the launch of healthcare AI models, a collection of cutting-edge multimodal medical imaging foundation models available in the Azure AI model catalog. Developed in collaboration with partners like Providence and Paige.ai, these models enable healthcare organizations to integrate and analyze diverse data types — ranging from medical imaging to genomics and clinical records. By using these advanced models as a foundation, healthcare organizations can rapidly build, fine-tune and deploy AI solutions tailored to their specific needs, all while minimizing the extensive compute and data requirements typically associated with building multimodal models from scratch.
""The development of foundational AI models in pathology and medical imaging is expected to drive significant advancements in cancer research and diagnostics,"" said Carlo Bifulco, MD, chief medical officer of Providence Genomics and a co-author of the Prov-GigaPath study. ""These models can complement human expertise by providing insights beyond traditional visual interpretation and, as we move toward a more integrated, multimodal approach, will reshape the future of medicine.""
Harnessing the power of healthcare data with Microsoft Fabric
Historically, healthcare data has been difficult to access due to its unstructured nature and the limitations of existing data management systems. These challenges have limited organizations' ability to gain a comprehensive view of patient experiences and access valuable insights.
With the general availability of healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, healthcare organizations can overcome these barriers by reshaping how users access, manage and act on data with a single, unified AI-powered platform. Additionally, healthcare security application templates for Microsoft Purview, an innovative suite of features designed to help govern healthcare data, are available in public preview. We're also launching new capabilities in public preview within healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric including:
Conversational data integration: Send conversational data, such as patient conversations, from DAX Copilot to the Fabric platform. By sending DAX Copilot audio files, transcripts and draft clinical notes to Fabric, customers and partners can leverage various native tools in Azure and Fabric to analyze this data and/or combine it with other data to generate comprehensive insights.
Social determinants of health (SDOH) public dataset transformation: Ingest, persist, harmonize and consume SDOH national and international public datasets to enable healthcare organizations to identify risks and health-related social needs to help create equitable healthcare for all patients and communities.
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) claim and claim line feed (CCLF) data ingestion: Streamline the ingestion of claims data and harmonize with clinical, imaging and SDOH data to unlock actionable insights on patients and populations.
Care management analytics: Leverage unified healthcare data and care management analytical templates to enhance patient care by identifying high-risk individuals, optimizing treatment plans and improving care coordination.
Data discovery and cohorting: Utilize an integrated workflow that allows healthcare organizations to create, manage, analyze and share patient cohorts.
Building a safe and responsible healthcare agent
Healthcare organizations face numerous challenges, including workforce shortages, rising costs and increasing patient care demands. Generative AI offers a potential solution to these challenges by automating administrative tasks, analyzing vast amounts of data for actionable insights and assisting healthcare professionals in decision-making.
To address this, Microsoft is announcing the public preview of healthcare agent service in Copilot Studio to build Copilot agents for appointment scheduling, clinical trial matching, patient triaging and more. Organizations can leverage the healthcare agent service to help create connected patient experiences, improve clinical workflows, and empower healthcare professionals while helping organizations meet industry expectations with Microsoft Copilot Studio. Early adopters, like Cleveland Clinic, which provided feedback to help optimize the solution for a healthcare setting, are already using these innovations to enhance patient experiences and improve operational efficiency.
Enhancing nursing workflows with AI: nursing early outcomes
With the World Health Organization (WHO)1 predicting a shortage of 4.5 million nurses by 2030, the urgency to deliver technology to support the nursing profession is felt more than ever.
Last month at Epic's UGM, we announced the next focus area for our collaboration in Epic Workshop. Today, we're sharing more about how we're actively collaborating with several leading healthcare organizations — including Advocate Health, Baptist Health of Northeast Florida, Duke Health, Intermountain Health Saint Joseph Hospital, Mercy, Northwestern Medicine, Stanford Health Care, and Tampa General Hospital — to build an AI solution using ambient technology that addresses nursing documentation by drafting flowsheets for review, allowing nurses to focus less on paperwork and more on their patients. This innovation expands on the company's long-standing strategic collaboration and joint development initiatives with Epic.
""AI is transforming nursing workflows by streamlining administrative tasks, allowing nurses to focus more on patient care,"" said Corey Miller, vice president of R&D at Epic. ""Together with Microsoft, we're using AI-powered ambient voice technology to populate patient assessments. Nurses using the tool are already sharing positive feedback on how it enhances personalized patient interactions.""
""For nurses, the integration of AI-driven solutions into our workflows is a game changer,"" said Terry McDonnell, DNP, ANCP-BC, senior vice president and chief nurse executive, Duke University Health System, vice dean for Clinical Affairs, Duke University School of Nursing, Duke Health. ""It allows us to focus more on patient care rather than the administrative burden of documentation. By automating tedious tasks, Microsoft's ambient AI solution helps alleviate burnout and gives us more time to connect with our patients at the bedside, where we truly make a difference.""
Empowering responsible AI practices across healthcare
In line with Microsoft's dedication to responsible AI, these new solutions adhere to the company's AI principles established in 2018 to help guide AI development and use. Microsoft remains committed to developing responsible AI by design, ensuring that these technologies positively impact both the healthcare ecosystem and broader society. In practice this means properly building, testing and monitoring systems to avoid undesirable behaviors, such as harmful content, bias, misuse and other unintended risks. Over the years, we have made significant investments in building out the necessary governance structure, policies, tools and processes to uphold these principles and build and deploy AI safely. At Microsoft, we are committed to sharing our learnings on this journey of upholding our Responsible AI principles with our customers. We use our own best practices and learnings to provide people and organizations with capabilities and tools to build AI applications that share the same high standards we strive for.

The company's revenue streams are well-distributed across its three core segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. This diversification reduces reliance on any single product or service, providing stability and resilience against market fluctuations. For instance, the recent 23% increase in Microsoft Cloud revenue to $35.1 billion highlights the growing demand for cloud services and Microsoft's ability to capture this market segment effectively.
Strong Financial Performance: Microsoft's financial health remains robust, with a strong balance sheet and impressive revenue growth. The company's net income and diluted earnings per share have both seen substantial increases in the reported quarter, indicating efficient operations and profitability. These financial metrics not only reflect Microsoft's current success but also provide the company with the capital necessary to invest in future growth opportunities, such as expanding its AI capabilities and cloud infrastructure.
Dependency on Third-Party Manufacturers: While Microsoft has a strong operational foundation, it relies heavily on third-party contract manufacturers for device production. This reliance poses a risk of supply chain disruptions, which could impact the company's ability to meet consumer demand, especially for products with components sourced from a limited number of qualified suppliers. The recent 17% decrease in Devices revenue could be indicative of such vulnerabilities in the manufacturing process.
Competitive Pressure on Operating Margins: Microsoft faces intense competition in the technology sector, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. As the company continues to invest in cloud and AI infrastructure, these operating costs are expected to increase, potentially decreasing operating margins. The competitive landscape requires Microsoft to innovate continuously, which can strain financial resources and affect profitability.
Expansion in Cloud and AI Services: The growing demand for AI services presents Microsoft with significant opportunities to expand its datacenter locations and increase server capacity. The company's strategic investments in AI across its offerings position it to capitalize on this trend. For example, the 31% growth in Azure and other cloud services demonstrates Microsoft's potential to dominate this space and provide innovative solutions that meet evolving customer needs.
Strategic Acquisitions: Microsoft's acquisition strategy, as evidenced by the purchase of Activision Blizzard, enhances its gaming segment and content offerings. This move not only diversifies Microsoft's revenue streams but also strengthens its position in the gaming industry, a sector with substantial growth prospects. The 62% increase in Xbox content and services revenue, driven by the Activision Blizzard acquisition, showcases the potential of strategic mergers and acquisitions to drive growth.
Rapid Technological and Market Evolution: The technology industry is characterized by rapid changes in technologies and business models. Microsoft must continuously adapt to remain competitive. The shift in customer preferences towards mobile devices and the cloud requires Microsoft to innovate and adjust its product offerings, which may lead to increased research and development costs and operational challenges.
Geopolitical and Economic Uncertainties: Global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, such as currency fluctuations and market downturns, can significantly affect Microsoft's international operations and financial results. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions could disrupt sales, increase operating costs, or cause supply chain issues, thereby posing a threat to Microsoft's global business stability.
In conclusion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) exhibits a strong financial foundation and market leadership, bolstered by its diversified portfolio and strategic investments in cloud and AI services. However, the company must navigate challenges such as supply chain dependencies, competitive pressures, and the rapid evolution of technology and customer preferences. By leveraging its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats, Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain its status as a leading technology company in an ever-changing global landscape.

147,2024-01-09 11:30:00+00:00,Is Microsoft Stock a Buy?,"  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ","Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) business has exploded over the last decade, with its stock up about 920% since 2014. The company has become a tech behemoth, with growing positions in multiple areas of the industry. Significant cash reserves have helped Microsoft successfully venture into cloud computing, video games, artificial intelligence (AI), consumer products, and more.
The company is active in a diverse range of high-growth markets, making it one of the most attractive investment options right now. In fact, recent boosts to its stock price suggest Microsoft could be on a path to overtake Apple as the world's most valuable company by market cap.
So, here's why Microsoft's stock is a no-brainer buy right now.
The gap between Microsoft and Apple's market cap is narrowing, currently separated by about $100 billion. Microsoft is coming out of a stellar growth year, which saw its stock rise 57% throughout 2023, outperforming Apple's 48%. Meanwhile, the Windows company arguably has more growth opportunities in the coming years.
Apple has carved out a powerful position in tech with the immense popularity of products like the iPhone, MacBook, and a range of digital services. However, its reliance on consumers makes it vulnerable to macroeconomic headwinds, with revenue dipping 3% year over year in fiscal 2023.
Conversely, Microsoft's priority on commercial sectors like cloud computing and digital productivity services has fortified its business against the worst market declines. In its fiscal 2023, revenue rose 6% year over year to $212 billion, despite the economically challenging period. Growth was mainly driven by a 19% rise in revenue from its cloud platform, Azure, and a 9% increase from its productivity segment.
Moreover, Microsoft emerged as one of the biggest players in AI last year. Heavy investment in the industry saw it achieve a 49% stake in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, granting it access to some of the most advanced AI models.
The company has used OpenAI's tech to bring AI upgrades to many of its services, including Office, Azure, and search engine Bing. These platforms attract billions of users and could help Microsoft become the go-to for anyone looking to integrate AI into their workflow.
Apple is also investing in AI, but it remains unclear how it plans to use the technology to boost earnings over the long term, suggesting Microsoft has a firmer role in the high-growth sector for now.
This chart compares the forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of some of the most prominent names in tech, with Microsoft's higher figure indicating its stock is one of the more expensive options. However, the company has arguably earned its higher price tag by delivering years of reliable growth, leading positions in multiple tech markets, and significant cash reserves.
In fact, Microsoft surpassed $63 billion in free cash flow last year, suggesting it has the funds to fuel its R&D and overcome potential headwinds.
Additionally, EPS estimates show the company has much to offer new investors over the next two years.
This chart shows Microsoft's earnings could hit $15 per share by fiscal 2026. When multiplying that figure by the company's forward P/E of 33, you're given a stock price of $495. Considering Microsoft's current position, these projections would see its stock rise 35% over the next two fiscal years. Comparatively, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 have risen at annual growth rates of 23% and 17% over the last five years, suggesting Microsoft would outperform both indexes.
Alongside the fact it's a business on track to become the world's most valuable company, Microsoft's stock is a no-brainer buy this month and one you won't want to miss.

148,2024-08-26 12:00:16+00:00,Does Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?,  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ,"The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.
So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Microsoft with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.
 See our latest analysis for Microsoft 
If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Microsoft managed to grow EPS by 13% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.
Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Microsoft shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 42% to 45%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.
In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.
The trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Microsoft's future EPS 100% free.
We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$3.1t company like Microsoft. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.0b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.03% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.
One positive for Microsoft is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Microsoft by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.
There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.

149,2024-06-03 11:00:46+00:00,"Microsoft Insiders Sell US$82m Of Stock, Possibly Signalling Caution",  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ,"Many Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.
Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
 See our latest analysis for Microsoft 
The President & Vice Chairman, Bradford Smith, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$20m worth of shares at a price of US$412 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$415. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 8.7% of Bradford Smith's stake.
Microsoft insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!
If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of small cap stocks that are not only being bought by insiders but also have attractive valuations.
Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Microsoft. Specifically, insiders ditched US$24m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.
I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Microsoft insiders own 0.03% of the company, worth about US$1.0b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.
Insiders haven't bought Microsoft stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that Microsoft is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Microsoft. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Microsoft that deserve your attention before buying any shares.

150,2024-10-06 16:27:45+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Maintains Overweight Rating Amid Concerns Over Generative AI Revenue and Data Center Demand,  Usman Kabir ,"We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.
US technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk.
While tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI.

This has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave — particularly in software and cloud services.
Their scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants.
Let's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss recently penned an investor note on the firm, maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $508. In the note, the analyst highlighted that investor patience appeared to be wearing thin with the tech giant regarding generative AI revenue, and questions were being asked around the return on investment in GPU spending and the environmental impacts of rising data center demand. Weiss underlined that as a perceived leader in the GenAI opportunity, investors looked to Microsoft for indications on the proper time horizons for seeing revenues start to flow.
Weiss also discussed the return of investment on capex spending by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has risen 75% year-over-year to $55.7 billion, including capital leases. In fiscal 2025, that is expected to rise another 41% to reach $78.4 billion. Per the analyst, the spending question needed to be split into two, with one focused on the gross margin potential of GenAI related solutions, and the other on future model training costs.
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.

Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.
As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

152,2024-03-24 07:00:00+00:00,"Microsoft Stock Still Has Upside After Its Recent Surge, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst. Is the Stock a Buy Near Its All-Time High?","  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ","There's little question that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has benefited from its early focus on the shift to artificial intelligence (AI). The company was quick to adopt and integrate generative AI tools across a broad cross-section of its products and services, which has fueled a robust rally, pushing the stock up 58% over the past year.
One Wall Street investment bank believes there's more upside to come.
KeyBanc's Jackson Ader initiated coverage of Microsoft, assigning the stock an overweight (buy) rating and $490 price target. That suggests potential upside for investors of 15% given the stock's closing price of $429.37 on Mar. 21. The analyst wrote that Microsoft ""sits in the catbird seat in two of the three main ways software vendors can monetize the AI wave.""
Ader is, of course, referring to Microsoft's cloud infrastructure offering Azure and its growing suite of Microsoft Copilots -- digital assistants fueled by generative AI that help boost productivity.
There's evidence that suggests he is spot on. Its flagship Copilot for Microsoft 365 has been deeply integrated into the company's portfolio of Office productivity tools, but the company isn't stopping there. Microsoft quickly released an entire suite of AI-powered, job-specific Copilots for IT, sales, service, and finance, with more to come.
Furthermore, in each of the two most recent calendar quarters, Azure has grown faster than Alphabet's Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS), which suggests Azure is stealing cloud market share from its rivals. Management was quick to point out that an increasing contribution to Microsoft's cloud growth was the result of demand for AI.
Analysts' consensus estimates suggest Microsoft will grow revenue 15% in fiscal 2024 and 14% the following year. Microsoft is on track to hit that forecast with revenue up 15% through the first six months of fiscal 2024. But given the AI boost it's experiencing, revenue growth could end up coming in ahead of estimates.
The stock is currently selling for 36 times forward earnings. If its accelerating revenue growth continues, that could prove to be a bargain.

154,2024-07-03 13:30:00+00:00,Could Microsoft Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?,"  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ","Shares in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) have jumped 33% over the last 12 months, outperforming the S&P 500's already-impressive increase of 25%. The growth saw Microsoft surpass Apple as the world's most-valuable company, achieving a market capitalization above $3 trillion.
The company has rallied Wall Street by becoming one of the biggest threats in artificial intelligence (AI), an industry projected to hit nearly $2 trillion in spending by 2030. Meanwhile, consistent earnings gains, significant cash reserves, and leading positions in multiple areas of tech have made Microsoft's stock one of the most reliable investments out there.
So, here's why Microsoft stock could make you a millionaire with the right investment.
Microsoft's diversified revenue streams have instilled long-term reliability in its business. Its strength was most prevalent during an economic downturn in 2022. During the challenging year, rival Amazon's revenue rose 9% year over year while its operating income declined by nearly 50%. However, the same period saw Microsoft's revenue and operating income rise 7% and 6%, still delivering profit growth despite the marketwide pullback from consumers.
As a result, Amazon's stock fell 50% in 2022, while Microsoft's tumbled a more moderate 29%.
Microsoft owes much of its reliability to its varied activities in tech. The company offers investors the opportunity to back multiple industries, such as productivity software, cloud computing, digital advertising, video games, consumer products, AI, and more. That's before even considering Microsoft's dominance in sectors like operating systems with Windows and recent growth in its search engine, Bing.
Its diversified business model has delivered consistent earnings and stock growth over the years, allowing Microsoft to keep investing in new opportunities like AI. The company invested $1 billion in the ChatGPT developer in 2019 and has since increased that figure to about $13 billion.
The partnership has allowed Microsoft to bring AI upgrades to many of its products, including launching its AI assistant Copilot through its Microsoft 365 productivity suite. The new feature is a $30 monthly add-on to a 365 subscription and shows the company beginning to monetize its AI offerings.
Microsoft has growth catalysts across tech that will likely keep its stock price rising for decades.
Shares in Microsoft have steadily risen 237% over the last five years and 958% in the last decade. The company has proven time and time again its worth as a long-term growth stock. As a result, it's an excellent option for investors looking for stocks to buy that will passively grow over the years.
Microsoft's free cash flow hit $71 billion this year, more than competitors Amazon or Alphabet. The figure suggests Microsoft is potentially best equipped to keep investing in its business and overcome unforeseen hurdles.
Meanwhile, recent earnings gave a promising glimpse into the company's long-term future. In the third quarter of 2024 (which ended in March), Microsoft's revenue rose 17% year over year to $62 billion, beating Wall Street estimates by more than $1 billion. The company benefited from significant growth in its productivity and cloud segments, both boosted by AI.
Additionally, operating income climbed 23% to $28 billion after an over-30% increase in its intelligent-cloud segment. Microsoft is on a promising growth trajectory that's just too good to pass up.
The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 39 means it isn't exactly a bargain. The chart above shows it's a better value than Amazon but not quite as good as Alphabet. However, stellar gains over the years, a potent position in technology, and vast financial resources indicate that Microsoft's stock is worth its premium price tag.
The company's share price will likely continue trending up over the long term, making it an excellent option for patient investors. Microsoft has become a behemoth in tech, with its stock a compelling option that could make you a millionaire if you're willing to wait.

155,2024-04-02 15:31:00+00:00,Microsoft (MSFT) Splits Teams and Office to Counter EU Scrutiny,  Zacks Equity Research ,"Microsoft MSFT has announced that it will sell its chat and video app, Teams, separately from its Office product worldwide. This decision comes six months after the tech giant unbundled the two products in Europe, a move aimed at averting a potential European Commission (EU) antitrust fine.The EU has been investigating Microsoft's bundling of Office and Teams since 2020, following a complaint by Slack, a competing workspace messaging app owned by Salesforce CRM, accusing MSFT of anti-competitive behavior by forcing Teams onto Office subscribers and obscuring its true cost.Teams, initially introduced to Office 365 in 2017 and later replaced Skype for Business, gained significant traction during the pandemic, particularly for its video conferencing capabilities.To address these concerns and comply with regulatory feedback, MSFT began selling the products separately in the EU and Switzerland on Oct 1, 2023. Despite the unbundling, Microsoft Teams' user base has remained relatively stable. Sensor Tower data indicates that the platform's monthly active users on mobile remained unchanged at 19 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared with the previous quarter.In response to the unbundling, the company has introduced new commercial Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites that exclude Teams outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland. Additionally, a standalone Teams offering for Enterprise customers in these regions has been launched.Effective Apr 1, customers can choose to continue with their existing licensing deals and renew, update, or switch to the new offerings. Pricing for Office without Teams ranges from $7.75 to $54.75 for new commercial customers, while Teams Standalone is priced at $5.25. Prices may vary by country and currency.Despite these measures, MSFT's unbundling may not fully shield it from further regulatory scrutiny. EU antitrust charges, potentially focusing on the level of fees and compatibility of rival messaging services with Office Web Applications, are expected in the coming months.With a history of EU antitrust fines totaling approximately $2.37 billion over the past decade, Microsoft faces potential charges of up to 10% of its global annual turnover if found guilty of antitrust breaches.

157,2024-09-08 20:44:28+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): A Magic Formula Stock You Should Pay Attention To,  Ramish Cheema ,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks For The Rest Of 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other magic formula stocks.
One of the best known investment strategies on Wall Street, and one that's also followed by investing greats the like of Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group is value investing. Another fund manager who has delivered fantastic returns through a value based approach is Joel Greenblatt. Greenblatt currently runs the hedge fund Gotham Asset Management, a fund that he set up in 2008 after moving forward from his previous fund called Gotham Capital.
Greenblatt is among the fund managers that have consistently delivered double digit percentage returns during their career on Wall Street. His previous firm, Gotham Capital, had an amazing run between 1985 and 1994. During this time period, the firm delivered a net return of 34%. This was particularly impressive, as 1985 was the year in which Gotham Capital was founded. On an annualized basis, the fund's returns were even stronger, since during the same period, Greenblatt's fund delivered 50% in returns.
The hallmark of a value investing strategy, as you'll understand if you study Warren Buffett's investment strategy in detail, is patience. This also applies to Greenblatt, who typically waits for at least a couple of years after making an investment to reap the returns. But while patience might be a virtue, on Wall Street, it's the returns that matter. On this front, Greenblatt hasn't disappointed, as his fund's blazing run in the 1980s wasn't its only one. After setting up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, the value investor managed multiple funds. Two of these were the Gotham Absolute Return (AR) fund and the Gotham Neutral fund. Among these, the AR fund was set up in 2012, and between then and 2018, its returns sat at 58.6%.
However, while these returns are impressive, this period was filled with ups and downs for the investment vehicle. For instance, 2013 was one of the best years for this fund as it posted 29.82% in returns. These gains were trimmed down to 9.31% in 2014. While these weren't as strong as the previous year's performance, they were nevertheless in the green. This is important since the next year wasn't great by any account, since in 2015, the AR fund ended up with -10.25%. 2016 was somewhat turbulent for American stock markets since the Brexit vote in the UK, slowing Chinese GDP growth, and a commodities slump led to US and global stocks dipping between the end of 2015 and the first half of 2016. Between June 2015 and late February 2016, the blue chip Dow index had lost roughly 9% and the broader NASDAQ had bled a much higher 11%.
The next year would see Greenblatt bounce back. In 2016, the fund delivered 7.97% in returns and accelerated its performance later on through posting 10.03% in gains. During these same years, i.e., in 2014, the Gotham Neutral fund's annualized returns had sat at 6.83%.
Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019, the stock market has been operating in a changed environment. The pandemic's immediate aftermath saw major stock indexes crash by 30%+, which then led to the Federal Reserve reducing rates to near zero levels. The subsequent low cost of capital, the boom in demand for consumer technology products, and the rise in retail investing then saw markets soar. During this time period, i.e., the bottom in March 2020 and the peak of December 2021, Greenblatt's AR fund was up by 55% while the flagship S&P index gained 103%. This might make you think that perhaps the investor, who calls his investment approach a 'Magic Formula' had lost its magic.
But you'd be wrong. The magic of the Magic Formula was visible during the next phase of the stock market. This was marked by the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate tightening cycle that came in response to soaring inflation. Between December 2021 and October 2023, inflation continued to rise, as the interest rates took their sweet time to make a mark. This meant that the flagship S&P was down by 13.6% from 2021 close to the end of October 2023.
However, during the same period, the AR fund had gained 3.41%. A short strategy had helped Greenblatt, it seems, as the AR fund advertises itself as being 50% to 60% net long. Gotham's pure play long fund, which is 100% long, led the S&P in losses during this time period as it had lost 15.52% during the same period and a stronger 27% from its peak in November start. However, the magic was visible between the March bottom and the November 2021 peak as during this period the 100% long fund had gained 97% to nearly match the flagship index.
Before we head to our list of the best Magic Formula Stocks, it's also important to take a brief look at what this investment technique entails. Greenblatt's strategy is based on two metrics, the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. In a simple implementation, stocks are ranked according to these metrics, and the top stocks are bought and held for the long term. A specialty implementation is what Gotham calls its Gotham Yield. According to the fund, this is a proprietary technique that assesses a firm's ""pre-tax cash flow, return on capital, and enterprise value.""
Our Methodology
To make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy, we ranked the stocks present in Gotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 SEC filings by their dollar value and picked out the most valuable holdings.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the mega cap technology giant that is one of the biggest players in the cloud computing industry as well as personal computing. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Windows powers up most of the world's computers, while Azure is believed to control 26% of the global cloud computing market. Like other big tech firms, it has access to its own foundational model, through partner firm OpenAI's ChatGPT. OpenAI's brand status as the firm that popularized AI also allows Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to benefit from the association. This is key to the firm's future especially as it plans to market AI products to enterprise customers through cloud computing. The central tenet of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s hypothesis these days is its ability to monetize AI especially since it has plowed billions of dollars into the technology. In fact, after its Q2 earnings, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s shares tanked by 8% as it revealed that Azure growth had slowed to 29% from an earlier 31%––which cast doubts on its ability to add tailwinds from AI services.
The stock began to recover though as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s shared during the earnings call:
“For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 18% and 20% in constant currency, or US$28.6 billion to US$28.9 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth to be 28% to 29% in constant currency. Growth will continue to be driven by our consumption business, inclusive of AI, which is growing faster than total Azure. We expect the consumption trends from Q4 to continue through the first half of the year. This includes both AI demand impacted by capacity constraints and non-AI growth trends similar to June. Growth in our per-user business will continue to moderate.
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

161,2024-10-07 13:30:10+00:00,Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Microsoft (MSFT): Should You Buy?,  Zacks Equity Research ,"When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?
Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Microsoft (MSFT).
Microsoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.18, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.18 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 39 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 34 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.2% and 7.7% of all recommendations.
Check price target & stock forecast for Microsoft here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Microsoft, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.
Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.
In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.
Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.
Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.
Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.
It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.
In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.
Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.
Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.
In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Microsoft, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0% over the past month to $13.04.
Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.
The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Microsoft. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Microsoft with a grain of salt.

162,2024-05-24 13:00:15+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,  Zacks Equity Research ,"Microsoft (MSFT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 4.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $2.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.5%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $11.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +20%. This estimate has changed +1.4% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.18 indicates a change of +12% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $64.16 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $244.41 billion and $278.17 billion estimates indicate +15.3% and +13.8% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Microsoft reported revenues of $61.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17%. EPS of $2.94 for the same period compares with $2.45 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $60.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.02%. The EPS surprise was +4.63%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Microsoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

163,2024-08-26 18:03:06+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): A Good Technology Stock To Buy For Long Term,  Talha Qureshi ,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Technology Stocks to Buy for Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other technology stocks.
The technology industry is one of the key drivers of the global economy. According to MGI research, the global technology industry was valued at $8.51 trillion in 2022 and is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.75% to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. In the United States alone the information technology industry drives more than one-third of the national economy.
One of the latest trends in the tech industry has been the increasing investments in artificial intelligence by both tech giants and start-up companies. According to a July 3 report by Reuters, the US venture capital funding surged to $55.6 billion during the second quarter of 2024. The funding surged more than 47% on a quarterly basis and was mainly driven by significant investments in artificial intelligence companies including $6 billion raised by Elon Musk’s xAI.
However, over the past few months, the technology sector has seen a major sell-off due to what analysts call an “AI bubble”. The sell-off initiated with investors raising concerns over return on investment regarding the premium they have been paying as capital expenditure on artificial intelligence. On August 5, CNBC reported that the “Magnificent Seven” US tech companies lost a combined $1 trillion market value at the start of the trading day. As a result, NASDAQ was down 3%, marking the index’s steepest three-week slide in two years.
We recently covered the AI tech bubble in detail in 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst. Here’s a glimpse of the article:
“In the past few weeks, a major selloff in the technology sector, mostly over concerns about return on investments amid ballooning capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), has hit the stock market, sending valuations crashing and igniting fears of an AI bubble at the marketplace that might be about to burst. However, Stacy Rasgon, who has covered semiconductor stocks, one of the most prominent sectors in the AI world, for over fifteen years, has advised investors to stay the course, terming fears of a bubble as overblown. Rasgon claims that even though chances of an air pocket, used to refer to stock plunges, are 100%, he is confident the time for them is not now. He pointed to the very real and massive AI data center build as an example, predicting it would go on for a few years, helping push AI stocks higher.”
Michael Landsberg, Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth CIO appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the AI bubble. He believes that the AI bubble hasn’t popped yet and what we saw recently was a reset of the market, where the market resets out-of-sync factors, and does not mean that the analysts are not positive about AI. He further added that a lot of AI companies have had a great past six months and are growing their earnings. He believes that ultimately earnings drive any stock and as far as AI stocks are concerned their earnings are growing and will continue to grow, thereby increasing the price.
Moreover, Steve Eisman, Neuberger Berman Senior Portfolio Manager appeared on another CNBC interview termed the recent events as a “Psychological Rotation”. He mentioned that this was not a fundamental rotation, which could have been troublesome, rather it is a psychological rotation that will not hold for long. He further mentioned that Artificial intelligence is here to stay for years and he still sees massive growth opportunities for companies investing in AI.

Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter.

We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.”

164,2024-07-30 20:49:31+00:00,Microsoft Cloud Miss Overshadows Earnings Beat,  Naomi Buchanan ,"
Microsoft reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024.
The tech giant said the results were driven by strength in its cloud segment, though Microsoft's cloud growth missed estimates.
Shares of Microsoft tumbled in extended trading Tuesday following the company's earnings release.

Microsoft (MSFT) reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, but growth in its cloud segment missed estimates, sending shares tumbling in extended trading Tuesday.
The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $64.7 billion, a 15% jump year-over-year, and above analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Net income came in at $22 billion or $2.95 per share, up from $20.08 billion or $2.69 per share a year earlier, also beating projections.
For the full fiscal year of 2024, revenue and net income were in line with analysts' expectations at $245.1 billion and $88.1 billion, respectively.
""As a platform company, we are focused on meeting the mission-critical needs of our customers across our at-scale platforms today, while also ensuring we lead the AI era,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a release.
Microsoft said its results in the fourth quarter and the fiscal 2024 year were driven by strength in its cloud segment, though Microsoft's cloud growth missed expectations.
Microsoft Cloud's revenue in the fourth quarter was $36.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year, but short of the $37.2 billion that analysts anticipated.
Shares of Microsoft fell over 5% in after-hours trading to $399.38 as of 4:45 p.m. Tuesday following the company's earnings announcement.

167,2024-04-04 08:51:00+00:00,"Near an All-Time High, Is Microsoft Stock Still a Buy?","  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ","One of the clear winners of the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has been Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The stock generated impressive gains of 57% in 2023, tacking on an additional 12% so far this year (as of market close on Wednesday), and regularly breaches new all-time highs.
The company is best known for its ubiquitous Windows operating system, Office suite of productivity software, and Teams workplace collaboration platform. Most recently, however, Microsoft planted its flag in the area of generative AI, quickly integrating AI functionality into its roster of products and services.
This has investors in a quandary. After notching 75% gains in roughly 15 months, is Microsoft stock still a buy? Let's see what the data says.
It's easy to suggest that Microsoft was simply in the right place at the right time, but that would ignore the hard work going on behind the scenes. While generative AI first captured the spotlight early last year, Microsoft bet on the technology much earlier, investing $1 billion in AI start-up OpenAI back in 2019. Thus began a long-term partnership that helped take the technology to the next level.
The collaboration yielded a system that used supercomputers to train the large language models (LLMs) that underpin generative AI. The resulting bots could complete a variety of impressive tasks: generate frighteningly accurate images based on voice prompts, answer complicated questions, and complete the coding on an unfinished software app.
Microsoft decided to test the utility of this last bot within GitHub, a company it acquired in 2018. The platform, a place where developers worked together on software apps and shared code, was the perfect testing ground for such a tool. Despite its imperfections, developers flocked to the GitHub Copilot after its release in late 2021.
This success acted as a springboard for other Copilots that followed. In late 2022, Microsoft used a similar blueprint to train new versions of Copilot for each application in its Office Suite of workplace productivity tools. When Microsoft released a preview for public testing, Copilot contained ""guardrails"" or rules to limit incorrect responses. Furthermore, when Copilot responded to a query, it provided two responses, and testing partners were asked to choose the preferred response, further honing the tool's capabilities.
The results were so successful that Microsoft increased its stake in OpenAI to $13 billion by early 2023, accelerating the AI revolution that started with OpenAI's ChatGPT release.
Microsoft has since released a suite of industry- and job-specific Copilots, including those designed specifically for users in sales, service, and finance roles, with more on the drawing board.
CEO Satya Nadella has reported getting rave reviews from Copilot users. ""Customers tell us that once they use Copilot, they can't imagine work without it.""
It's too early to tell just how much this foray into AI will be worth to Microsoft, but that hasn't stopped Wall Street's best and brightest from trying. The company charges users $30 per person per month for Copilot for Microsoft 365. Analysts from Piper Sandler estimate this could generate incremental revenue of $10 billion by 2026. Macquarie Research suggests that Copilot could generate $14 billion in revenue in its first full year alone -- and that's if just 10% of Microsoft's enterprise customers use the product. Analysts at Evercore are much more bullish, calculating that Copilot could add as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue by 2027.
Microsoft stock is currently selling for roughly 36 times forward earnings, which is a premium compared to a multiple of 28 for the S&P 500 index. While no one knows for sure just how much the company will reap from its Copilot strategy, the bump in revenue will likely be substantial.
Be that as it may, the evidence suggests that Microsoft stock is still a reasonable buy, even near its all-time high.

Microsoft said in a statement the investment would be the U.S. company's largest in Italy to date. It will make the cloud region ItalyNorth one of the biggest Microsoft data centres in Europe, working as a data hub also for the Mediterranean and north Africa.
Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith met Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Wednesday, the PM's office said in a note, adding the government welcomed an investment that would strengthen Italy's digital role in the Mediterranean.
On Monday, Meloni met U.S. fund BlackRock Inc chief Larry Fink, who travelled to Rome to discuss possible investments in data centres and to support energy infrastructure.
BlackRock and Microsoft announced last month a fund worth more than $30 billion to invest in AI-focused data centres, AI supply chains and energy sourcing, saying the vehicle would first look at the U.S. market and then at U.S. partner countries.
Demand for AI and cloud services is growing fast with firms in sectors as varied as gaming and e-commerce differentiating offerings through the integration of custom AI models - programs that employ pattern recognition to make decisions. ($1 = 0.9056 euros)

176,2024-05-23 08:22:14+00:00,AI is making Microsoft vs. Apple interesting again, Daniel Howley    · Technology Editor,"For the first time in a long time, the battle between Macs and PCs is interesting again.
Apple's (AAPL) products have been beating out Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows-based PCs for years thanks to their superior battery life and performance. But Microsoft says it’s finally tipped the scales back in its own favor.
“We have more powerful silicon. We've rewritten [Windows 11] to take advantage of it. And then we have unique experiences we've built on top of that platform,” Microsoft consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi told Yahoo Finance. “So I think we have a distinct advantage for a period of time here.”
Microsoft says it’s achieved this through a new category of AI PCs it’s calling Copilot+ PCs.
You’ve probably already heard about AI PCs, which are PCs that include special neural processing units (NPUs) that can run AI apps locally rather than relying on cloud-based services like ChatGPT.
Copilot+ PCs include those same NPUs, but also come with a minimum of 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and, importantly, run Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant for Windows 11.
Microsoft’s Copilot+ PCs come as the PC industry hopes it’s entering a period of sustained sales growth after two years of steep declines. According to IDC, PC sales grew 1.5% in the first quarter compared to a drop of 28.7% in Q1 last year.
“There's no doubt in my mind that the demand is here,” Mehdi said. “And this is going to spur a purchase of PCs in ways that we haven't had before.”
For the first time in decades, Mehdi added, Microsoft feels it has an edge on Apple from both a performance standpoint and because it offers “completely unique things that you can’t do anywhere else.”
Apple is notoriously behind Microsoft in the AI race, having sat on the sidelines until very recently — though it has made sure that its hardware has extremely fast AI-ready chips.
Looking to take advantage of Apple being caught on the back foot, Microsoft hopes the Copilot+, which is powered by GPT-4o, will provide a seismic productivity boost with the ability to serve as a user's go-to assistant for tasks ranging from dealing with common problems like audio issues to summarizing documents.
Microsoft also introduced its new Copilot Recall, a feature that makes it easier to search virtually everything you’ve done on your PC, including documents, photos, and web pages. So, if you were planning a trip to Seattle but lost the site you were using to look up things to do, you can type “Seattle” into Recall, which will pull up the site you were browsing.
Microsoft says it does this by taking a snapshot of your screen over time and then using Copilot’s visual search feature to find the content you’re looking for. The company also says content saved in Recall is only stored on your device and that you can customize which apps use the feature.
Microsoft’s first Copilot+ PCs will hit the market in June starting at $999, conspicuously the same price as Apple’s MacBook Air.
Windows and Mac users may have different priorities, with many of them engrained in a specific ecosystem and unlikely to change. That is, unless perhaps fresh and exclusive AI functionality lures somebody over the fence. But they can still be put head to head.
Performance benchmarks have become major talking points, and Apple’s Mac laptops have been crushing Windows-based PCs in terms of power efficiency ever since the iPhone maker rolled out its first M1 chip for MacBooks in 2020.
Those Arm-based (ARM) chips have made it so MacBooks can last all day on a single charge while providing exceptional overall performance across a multitude of use cases. But Microsoft says its Windows PCs have a new weapon that puts it back in a leadership position: Qualcomm’s (QCOM) Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Pro chips.
During its announcement on Monday, the company said a Copilot+ PC running on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chip gets 20% more battery life, 23% better peak performance, and 58% better sustained multithread performance than Apple’s MacBook Air with an M3 chip.
What’s more, Mehdi said Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs beat out Apple’s latest M4 chip in terms of trillions of operations per second, or TOPs, a common measurement for gauging potential AI app performance.
For now, Microsoft has the edge thanks to an actual AI product. But Apple isn’t taking any of this lying down. The company will host its annual WWDC event on June 10, where it’s expected to roll out its own AI apps and services, including some that Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says will run on OpenAI’s AI software.
And as far as its MacBooks go, Apple is still likely to announce its M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, which should offer better performance than its M4 and could outpace Qualcomm’s chips.

177,2024-10-09 13:11:16+00:00,Analyst: Microsoft ‘Unlikely to Cut’ Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) Off,  Fahad Saleem ,"We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks in October. Since Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) ranks 8th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.
Tom Lee, Fundstrat co-founder, while talking to CNBC in a latest program, explained his bullish case for the market and why he believes the S&P 500 is headed to close the year “well beyond” 5,700.
“Bull markets are supported by a strong fundamentals and this is a case where not only has the economy survivie extremely high interest rates but the Fed is beginning to cut rates, and an economy that has been sort of languishing has been China. Now we have stimulus and what looks like some bazooka policies that are supporting that region, and we have a lot of cash on the sidelines. I think this is a formula for stocks to do pretty well the next three to 12 months, and that’s why we think that we would be well beyond 5700 before year-end.”
Lee said that he’s inclined to buy “risks outright” as he believes more upward momentum would come for stocks after the election.
“Small caps still have good fundamentals, earnings growth is accelerating, the media P/E is eleven times which is almost seven turns lower than the S&P so I think there is still case to be made that small-cap are starting a multi-year gain.”

Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) seems to be recovering from the widespread outage experienced in July, with analysts from TD Cowen noting that significant customer churn is not anticipated and that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is unlikely to sever ties with the cybersecurity firm.
In a recent note, TD Cowen analysts led by Shaul Eyal emphasized, “We reiterate our view that MSFT is unlikely to cut Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) off from accessing telemetry data out of the kernel given the mission criticality of the Falcon EDR platform product, which is deployed at over 29,000 customers, including 70% of the Fortune 100.” They observed that there does not appear to be significant near-term churn, as customers do not seem to be leaving in the wake of the July outage.
Eyal added that a more accurate assessment of revenue uplift potential will require patience over the next two quarters, allowing management to gain sufficient visibility into the Falcon Flex renewal pipeline. TD Cowen maintains its Buy rating on Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock with a price target of $380.
Despite the tech outage incident, the fundamental story of Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) remains unchanged. Wedbush Securities estimates that less than 5% of CrowdStrike’s customers might switch providers, potentially impacting revenue by $150 million out of the projected $3 billion in sales for fiscal year 2024. This would lower the company’s forward revenue growth from 30.6% to 25.6%, but even at this adjusted rate, Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD)  would remain well above the IT sector median.
TimesSquare Capital Management U.S. Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Our cybersecurity holdings were also beneficial to the strategy this quarter. That included the 20% gain from CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), a cloud-based network security service provider that supports a range of devices, endpoints, and cloud environments. CrowdStrike’s revenues and earnings exceeded expectations, with 33% growth in annual recurring revenue. CrowdStrike continues to see growing momentum in emerging areas such as Cloud Security, Identity, and Security Information & Event Management where it is displacing legacy providers. That led CrowdStrike’s management to increase its guidance for revenues and earnings for the balance of its fiscal year.”
Overall, Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) ranks 8th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks in October. While we acknowledge the potential of Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

178,2024-01-04 08:01:09+00:00,"Microsoft is adding an AI button to PC keyboards, their first major change in 30 years", Daniel Howley    · Technology Editor,"Microsoft (MSFT) is doubling down on its commitment to AI with the introduction of a new keyboard key dedicated specifically to the company’s Windows Copilot. The first update to the Windows PC keyboard in almost 30 years, the Copilot key will be available on laptops and desktop keyboards from Microsoft’s OEM partners beginning in February.
According to Microsoft corporate vice president and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi, pressing the key will bring up Copilot, allowing you to search for content on the web, as well as for your own content and for general PC features via the app’s generative AI functionality. The idea is for Copilot to function as a kind of smart assistant that you can pull up at any time.
While Microsoft didn’t announce any specific partners that will launch with the Copilot key, it said that companies should begin unveiling desktops and laptops equipped with the feature in the coming days. We’ll also get an up-close look at the capability at CES 2024, which kicks off Jan. 9.
By getting its hardware partners to add a Copilot key to their laptops and desktops, Microsoft is showing that it believes generative AI is inextricable from the future of personal computing. The last time Microsoft added a new keyboard key was when it debuted the Windows key in 1994.
Microsoft spent much of 2023 making a series of AI announcements ranging from the debut of its Bing chatbot and Edge browser to its Copilot for Microsoft 365. CEO Satya Nadella has said that advancements in AI will impact nearly every part of the company’s business.
Semiconductor giants are also getting in on the AI movement. AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), and Qualcomm (QCOM) have each debuted their own AI PC chips with dedicated neural processors designed to handle AI-specific tasks such as running generative AI applications.
How much consumers will benefit from those chips, though, is still up in the air. Even Intel doesn’t know exactly what kinds of apps developers will eventually cook up that rely on or take advantage of neural processors.
The AI PC movement comes at a time when the PC market is expected to return to growth for the first time since 2021, according to Goldman Sachs Equity Research analyst Michael Ng.
“In our view, global PC shipments in 2024 will be driven by the beginning of a refresh cycle as pandemic-purchased devices start to reach four years of age & new AI-capable PCs come to market (later in 2024) in what we view as the first technological shift in personal computing since the widespread adoption of smartphones/tablets,” Ng wrote in a note on Tuesday.
The expected resurgence in PC sales follows years of declines after an explosion of growth at the onset of the pandemic. At that time, consumers and businesses, eager to get their hands on PCs to work and play, purchased new laptops and desktops in droves.
As those systems age, however, consumers will begin buying up newer PCs, which will help drive AI PC adoption. And that will inevitably help Microsoft, as well as Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm’s bottom lines.

179,2024-01-31 11:56:19+00:00,"Microsoft beats Q2 earnings on AI, cloud strength", Daniel Howley    · Technology Editor,"Microsoft (MSFT) announced its second quarter earnings on Tuesday, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion, beating expectations of adjusted EPS of $2.78 on revenue of $61.1 billion.
The beats, however, failed to completely satisfy investors, as the stock moved about 1% lower in premarket trading Wednesday.
Microsoft's all-important cloud revenue topped out at $33.7 billion, beating estimates of $32.2 billion. The company's Intelligent Cloud business, which includes its Azure service, came in at $25.8 billion versus expectations of $25.3 billion. According to the company, AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, increasing from 3 percentage points last quarter.
""We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. ""By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we’re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.”
Microsoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI trade, sending shares jumping 50% over the last 12 months and Microsoft’s market capitalization over $3 trillion.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Microsoft was the wealthiest company in the world by market cap, outmuscling longtime rival Apple (AAPL), which has been stung by recent stock downgrades on fears of sluggish iPhone sales in China.
On the productivity side of things, Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes revenue hit $19.25 billion, just ahead of estimates of $19.03 billion. The company’s More Personal Computing business, which includes sales of its Windows software and Xbox gaming division, generated $16.89 billion.
Microsoft’s AI efforts permeate nearly every part of its business, and ensuring that pays off is something the company is heavily focused on. So far, it has monetized its AI efforts via generative AI cloud services, its Copilot for Microsoft 365 productivity platform, and its Copilot Pro for consumers.
Earlier this month, the company also opened up its Copilot for Microsoft 365 to all businesses, eliminating a prior requirement that customers needed to have 300 employees or more to sign up for the paid service. Clients pay $30 per user per month for access to the software. Copilot Pro for consumers, meanwhile, costs $20 per month per user, and is meant for consumer customers who want to take advantage of Copilot’s more advanced features.
Microsoft, as well as rivals Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), have been pouring billions of dollars into AI investments over the last year as they each seek to gain the upper hand in the race to be the AI software leader.
Microsoft grabbed an early lead thanks to its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, but Google and Amazon are gaining ground. Google released its powerful Gemini AI model in December, and in September, Amazon announced a $4 billion investment in AI company Anthropic giving the cloud giant a minority ownership position in the firm.
But generative AI technology has come under fire recently after users on X posted AI-generated explicit images of Taylor Swift. The move has prompted more calls for legislation targeting so-called deepfake images and videos.
Still, it’s unlikely the controversy will slow the AI train. With companies pumping out product announcements related to the technology at a steady pace, and PC and smartphone vendors debuting their own products capable of running generative AI software natively, it’s clear generative AI will be a force throughout 2024.

180,2024-10-07 07:15:07+00:00,Salesforce takes on GenAI copilot rival Microsoft,  GlobalData Technology ,"Salesforce is taking on archrival Microsoft in the competitive new space of copilots, which are AI assistants designed to help developers improve the customer experience (CX) across business interactions such as sales and support.
In an effort to improve its brand-awareness in a highly competitive space, Salesforce is going after leading agent/copilot competitors, including Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT, and IBM watsonx via Salesforce Agentforce’s autonomous decision-making abilities in response to enterprises’ demand for data/AI abstraction.
Following last month’s Salesforce Dreamforce mega conference held in San Francisco, the most provocative takeaway is the newly available autonomous agents for providing more accessible and advanced GenAI capabilities to the app development process.
Salesforce executives, starting with CEO Mark Benioff, made it abundantly clear they were going after Microsoft Copilot with the newly branded and advanced AI assistant, previously called Einstein AI.
This is an ambitious plan considering that Microsoft’s vast popularity is due to Copilot’s deep integration with Microsoft products, including Teams, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word. Microsoft also has an edge with the broader developer community, via GitHub Copilot. Enterprise DevOps teams predominantly use Microsoft Copilot based on their prevalent use of the Azure portfolio of developer tools and platforms to support app modernisation initiatives.
“Salesforce has an uphill battle as it seeks to gain mindshare against those heavyweights. Its best approach is to emphasise the autonomous qualities of its product, such as supporting more automation through AI and analytics to go above and beyond traditional stock chatbot answers in order to improve and personalise the customer experience,” said Charlotte Dunlap, Research Director at GlobalData.
“This is critical considering how many enterprises continue to fork over hefty premiums for professional services associated with ongoing unfamiliarity of immature GenAI technology. DevOps teams ill-equipped to formulate cohesive strategies complain of an inability to locate knowledgeable third-party expertise with an understanding of how GenAI fits into their current IT systems, particularly as they grapple with security and governance concerns,” she added. “The more automation/autonomy Salesforce builds into Agentforce as part of its traditional business apps and platforms offerings, the better its AI tools can be used intuitively, spurring greater adoption. Once again, this is where Salesforce reaps the benefits of leading integration capabilities provided by MuleSoft, not to mention its merits as the industry’s pioneer in low-code/intuitive app platforms.”
This is also why Salesforce talks up the idea of higher levels of abstraction around its data, such as Data Cloud, coupled with low-level UI.
Now, Salesforce is talking about abstracting AI and models, such as its Atlas Reasoning Engine, or the learning analytics engine which can go beyond traditional AI assistants to take broader actions involving customer requirements – actions that previously required human interaction. The agent support takes place across sales, service, and marketing functions.
How well Salesforce executes on its latest GenAI strategy will become more evident in coming months. But the company is keenly aware of what is riding on its ability to leverage past successes of effectively simplifying the developer experience.
Enterprises are demanding improved support from technology providers not only with AI innovations, but through thought leadership, which can help them make their case for going after budget and executive support. Enterprises tell GlobalData that they continue to struggle to gain such support.
""Salesforce takes on GenAI copilot rival Microsoft "" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.

183,2024-10-08 11:54:07+00:00,"After downgrading Amazon, Wells Fargo says buy Microsoft stock",Investing.com ,"Investing.com -- After downgrading Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) this week, Wells Fargo said it is increasing its Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) position, recommending investors focus on the tech giant as part of its ""Signature Picks"" portfolio.
The shift follows limited visibility for Amazon's future estimate revisions, while Microsoft shows strong momentum in its cloud and AI services, according to Wells Fargo analysts.
The bank removed Amazon from its Signature Picks portfolio after the downgrade, which cited challenges in the company's outlook.
While Amazon had delivered a solid performance, rising 40% since reintroduction into the portfolio in July 2023, Wells Fargo's Ken Gawrelski highlighted the ""limited visibility into further positive estimate revisions"" as a reason for the downgrade.
In contrast, Wells Fargo has increased its position in Microsoft, raising the allocation from 3.9% to 8.9%.
The bank's analysts are optimistic about Microsoft's Azure platform and its AI capabilities. The report highlighted positive Azure checks with partners finishing above plan for Azure in the recent quarter, driven by strong demand in cloud migration, modernization projects, and AI workloads.
""Stronger-than-usual checks suggest underlying Azure momentum continuing; expect shares benefit as more model clarity surfaces through FY25,"" said the bank.
Azure growth is expected to accelerate with 33% year-over-year growth in Q1, including 12 points from AI, Wells Fargo stated.
Additionally, Microsoft's rollout of Copilot, its AI-powered productivity tool, is expected to gradually drive adoption and long-term revenue, even though it's still in the early stages.
Wells Fargo has a price target of $515 for Microsoft, reflecting a premium based on its significant scale and favorable long-term growth prospects.
The report pointed out that the current capex investments in AI would continue to impact free cash flow multiples, but long-term earnings growth remains robust.

HSBC CEO Quinn Unexpectedly Steps Down After Almost 5 Years
The Windows software maker’s chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, was “very, very worried” when he looked at the AI model-training capability gap between Alphabet Inc.’s efforts and Microsoft’s, he wrote in a 2019 message to Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella and co-founder Bill Gates. The exchange shows how the company’s top executives privately acknowledged they lacked the infrastructure and development speed to catch up to the likes of OpenAI and Google’s DeepMind.
“We are multiple years behind the competition in terms of machine learning scale.”Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott
The email was released late Tuesday after media organizations including the New York Times and Bloomberg intervened in the landmark antitrust suit to push for greater public access. The US Justice Department has argued that OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other innovations may have been released years ago if Google hadn’t monopolized the search market.
Scott, who also serves as executive vice president of artificial intelligence at Microsoft, observed that Google’s search product had improved on competitive metrics because of the Alphabet company’s advancements in AI. The Microsoft executive wrote that he made a mistake by dismissing some of the earlier AI efforts of its competitors.
“We are multiple years behind the competition in terms of machine learning scale,” Scott said in the email. Significant portions of the message, titled ‘Thoughts on OpenAI,’ remain redacted. Nadella endorsed Scott’s email, forwarding it to Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood and saying it explains “why I want us to do this.”
Microsoft and OpenAI declined to comment. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Microsoft has poured more than $13 billion into its partnership and backing of OpenAI, tapping the startup’s generative-AI technology to enhance its Bing search service, Edge internet browser and, most notably, integrate an AI Copilot service into Windows. Nadella has elevated the AI race to a priority at the company, also recruiting DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman to run its consumer AI business.
Nadella answered questions about the email when he testified at the trial last fall. The company’s OpenAI “investment was not made with the narrow focus on just search,” he said at the time.
Microsoft and Google declined to make the email available when requested by reporters last year on the grounds that it would reveal sensitive business information. Media outlets pushed for its release, and Judge Amit Mehta last week ordered the companies to provide a redacted version, as the contents “shed light on Google’s defense concerning relative investments by Google and Microsoft in search.”
Google and the Justice Department will make closing arguments in the case on Thursday and Friday. Judge Mehta is expected to issue his decision later this year.
The case is US v. Google, 20-cv-3010, US District Court, District of Columbia.

187,2024-10-02 18:10:42+00:00,OpenAI closes $6.6 billion funding haul with investment from Microsoft and Nvidia,  Krystal Hu ,"By Krystal Hu
(Reuters) -OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has raised $6.6 billion from investors, which could value the company at $157 billion and cement its position as one of the most valuable private companies in the world.
The funding has attracted returning venture capital investors including Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, as well as OpenAI's biggest corporate backer Microsoft, and new participation from Nvidia.
The closing of the funds coincides with the company's ongoing restructuring efforts and executive changes, including the abrupt departure of its longtime Chief Technology Officer, Mira Murati, last week.
Altimeter Capital, Fidelity, SoftBank, and Abu Dhabi's state-backed investment firm MGX also participated in the round.
OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told employees on Wednesday that the company will be able to provide liquidity for them through a tender offer to buy back their shares in the company following the funding, although no details and timing have been decided, according to a source. Earlier this year, the company allowed some employees to cash out their shares at a valuation of $86 billion.
Thrive Capital, which committed about $1.2 billion from a combination of its own fund and a special purpose vehicle for smaller investors, negotiated the option to invest another $1 billion next year at the same valuation if the AI firm hits a revenue goal, sources added.
Apple, which was in talks to invest in OpenAI, did not end up joining the funding, sources said, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The funding came in the form of convertible notes, and the conversion to equity hinges on a successful structural change into a for-profit that would no longer be controlled by the non-profit board and the removal of cap on returns for investors.
The personnel changes haven't deterred enthusiasm from most investors, who are anticipating significant growth based on the projections by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.
The company is on pace to generate $3.6 billion in revenue this year on mounting losses of over $5 billion. It projects major revenue jump next year to $11.6 billion, according to sources familiar with the figures.
Investors have also secured some protections as OpenAI undergoes the complex corporate restructuring that would grant Altman equity. The talks are still ongoing, and no timeline has been determined yet.
Investors have negotiated terms that would allow them to claw back their capital or renegotiate the valuation if the changes are not implemented within two years, sources said.
OpenAI's meteoric rise in terms of product popularity and valuation has captured the world's imagination. Since the launch of ChatGPT, it has attracted 250 million weekly active users. The company's valuation has also risen from $14 billion in 2021 to $157 billion as it grew revenue from zero to $3.6 billion, far exceeding Altman's own projections at the time.
The company has told investors it is still actively pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI), meaning developing AI systems that surpass human intelligence, as it ramps up commercialization and tries to be profitable.

188,2024-10-12 11:09:31+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Unveils New AI Tools to Enhance Healthcare Efficiency and Support Medical Staff,  Usman Kabir ,"We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other trending AI stocks.
Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.

Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.
As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

189,2024-09-27 14:43:22+00:00,Microsoft: Cloud and AI Will Bring the Stock to New Highs,  TipRanks ,"Microsoft has regularly outpaced the stock market, more than tripling over the past five years. The stock is a little less than 10% removed from its all-time high, but it won’t be like that for long. Microsoft Cloud and the company’s AI initiatives prompt me to be bullish on the stock. These two parts of Microsoft’s business can help the stock reach a new high.
To begin with, Microsoft isn’t the only cloud giant in town, but it’s gaining ground on the largest cloud provider, warranting a bullish stance. Microsoft now has a 25% market share in the cloud computing industry. It’s an improvement that narrows the gap with Amazon (AMZN). AWS is currently the largest cloud platform and has 31% of the market. Alphabet (GOOGL) is in a distant third place, with 11% of the total market share.
Moreover, Microsoft gained even more ground in the second quarter of Fiscal 2024. Cloud revenue grew by 21% year-over-year in Q4 FY24, while AWS revenue only increased by 19% year-over-year in Q2 2024. If Microsoft maintains an elevated growth rate compared to AWS, it can continue to gain market share.
In addition, more market share is good in any industry, but it’s even better in a growing industry. Artificial intelligence should result in more demand for cloud platforms. These platforms offer a pathway for many businesses to use generative AI. Microsoft also regularly updates its cloud platform with new AI features that help it stand out from the competition.
The unique angle with Microsoft compared to other tech giants in the cloud industry is that most of Microsoft’s revenue comes from cloud computing. That’s another reason for my bullishness since cloud computing is a promising industry.
What’s important to note is that cloud revenue makes up less than 20% of total revenue for Amazon (as seen below in the TipRanks Revenue Breakdown tool) and Alphabet. Investors in those stocks are getting limited exposure to cloud computing since the other components of those companies generate most of the revenue.
On the other hand, Microsoft regularly pulls in more than half of its revenue from cloud computing – as seen in the TipRanks Revenue Breakdown tool below. The tech giant generated $64.7 billion in Q4 FY24, which was up by 15% year-over-year. Diving deeper into the numbers, Microsoft Cloud generated $36.8 billion in the quarter, up by 21% year-over-year. That’s almost 60% of total revenue.
Microsoft Cloud gave the company a head start in artificial intelligence, but the cloud platform isn’t the only AI catalyst. Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI and the release of Copilot are some of the reasons I’m bullish. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella used the Q4 FY24 results to emphasize Microsoft’s desire to ensure it is leading the AI era.
Additionally, while tech giants have been catching up, Microsoft has done a good job at incorporating AI across its offerings. For instance, you can find autogenerated suggestions underneath LinkedIn posts. Microsoft Copilot also helps boost productivity by simplifying repetitive tasks across Microsoft products. The tech giant also revealed Copilot for Security earlier this year, which makes cybersecurity more accessible to small businesses.
Although Microsoft was always bound to cede some of its market share to rivals, the tech giant’s first-mover advantage suggests that it can maintain its current position. As the AI pie continues to grow, Microsoft should report elevated revenue and net income growth.
While AI and cloud computing are the main reasons to be bullish about Microsoft, it also has other business segments that continue to perform well. For instance, LinkedIn delivered 10% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 FY24. The social network has become a top resource for business professionals who want to grow their careers and build their networks.
Furthermore, Microsoft delivered 19% year-over-year revenue growth for search and news advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs. Microsoft also fortified its position in the gaming industry with its Activision Blizzard acquisition. As a result, Xbox revenue jumped by 61% year-over-year, with Activision Blizzard contributing 58 percentage points to the growth rate.
Overall, Microsoft’s well-diversified business is hard to find among other publicly traded corporations. In addition, the company’s investments in artificial intelligence can help the company discover more growth opportunities with these parts of the business.
Microsoft is currently rated as a Strong Buy by 30 analysts, with 28 Buys and 2 Holds. The average MSFT price target of $501.15 implies an upside potential of 16%.

190,2024-10-02 13:00:17+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,  Zacks Equity Research ,"Microsoft (MSFT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Shares of this software maker have returned +2.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Microsoft belongs, has gained 1.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $3.08 per share, indicating a change of +3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $13.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.02 indicates a change of +15.2% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Microsoft.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
In the case of Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate of $64.42 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14%. The $277.36 billion and $314.73 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.2% and +13.5%, respectively.
Microsoft reported revenues of $64.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.2%. EPS of $2.95 for the same period compares with $2.69 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.84%. The EPS surprise was +1.72%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Microsoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

191,2024-09-30 13:08:17+00:00,Analysts Think Microsoft (MSFT) is Losing AI Battle Amid Intense Competition,  Fahad Saleem ,"We recently published a list of Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner. Since Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.
Brad Gerstner, the founder of Altimeter Capital, has been a major believer in AI and tech stocks in general. Recently, the 53-year-old hedge fund manager shared some interesting data points highlighting the importance of tech stocks during an interview with Scott Galloway’s YouTube channel.
“Since 2014 technology earnings have compounded at 16% and technology stocks have compounded at 18%. Non-tech earnings have compounded at about 4% and stocks at about 6%. So if you look at the long run of technology since 2005 it’s gone from 5% of global GDP to 15% of global GDP,” Gerstner said.
Gerstner, whose firm manages about $10 billion in assets, emphasized during the interview that the risk of not investing in AI is higher than the risk of investing. He was addressing the market concerns about ROI on AI spending.
“As a professional investor, we’re just trying to determine what level of asymmetry what level of enthusiasm or exuberance is baked into these stocks and what are we seeing day to day in terms of usage and revenues out of the consumer,” he said.
For this article we scanned Altimeter Capital’s Q2 portfolio and discussed its biggest AI stock picks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Microsoft is among the top AI picks of Altimeter as of Q2.
However, some believe OpenAI was the only key edge Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) had in the AI race and it’s quickly fading away.
DA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company’s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum.
Luria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA’s, according to Luria.
Following a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft’s dependence on NVIDIA.
Luria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins.
The analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities.
The concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta’s Llama 3.1.
Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft’s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure’s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.”
Overall, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

192,2024-10-02 12:41:25+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)’s AI and Azure Lead Its 15% Revenue Growth: Is It Time to Buy?,  Sheryar Siddiq ,"We recently published a list of 7 Best Software Infrastructure Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other best software infrastructure stocks to invest in now.
Technology drives nearly every facet of modern businesses, from individual tasks to overall operations, goods, and services. When integrated effectively, it enhances communication, boosts efficiency, and increases productivity. Both tech and non-tech companies rely on software infrastructure and solutions to keep their operations running smoothly. To that end, these companies invest heavily in servers, cloud migration, network monitoring and management, and communication tools—all crucial components of software infrastructure.
One of the largest segments of the software infrastructure market is the cloud infrastructure industry. As businesses increasingly adopt cloud solutions to reduce costs and enhance efficiency, the demand for these services continues to grow. According to Synergy Research Group, global enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services reached $79 billion in the second quarter, marking a $14.1 billion or 22% increase from the same period in 2023. This represents the third consecutive quarter of substantial growth, with year-over-year increases exceeding 20%.
Specifically, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) emerged as a rapidly growing segment within the cloud infrastructure industry. Leading companies like Salesforce offer powerful functionalities through subscription-based models delivered over the web. This approach provides lower upfront costs, easy deployment, and ongoing updates, making advanced tools accessible to businesses of all sizes. In the SaaS model, providers grant customers access to application software and databases via the cloud. In 2023, the global SaaS market generated around $197 billion in revenue, representing nearly two-thirds of the total public cloud services market. Although SaaS revenue is projected to keep growing, its share of the overall cloud services market may decrease as cloud platform and infrastructure services expand.
Meanwhile, IT leaders are turning to tech consolidation in response to global economic challenges like inflation, recession, and supply chain disruptions, as well as the need to reduce costs while modernizing IT infrastructure. Gartner predicted that global IT spending would reach around $5.26 trillion in 2024, an increase of 7.5% from 2023. However, rapid expansion in technology investments can lead to tech sprawl, with new tools often lacking compatibility. According to a report from Zylo, organizations have wasted an average of $18 million this year alone due to inefficient SaaS management.
On another front, cybersecurity emerged as a critical component of software infrastructure, with spending surging since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As cloud computing and remote work have become integral to business operations, organizations have encountered new security challenges. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, the number of data breaches reached an all-time high in 2023, increasing by 71% from the previous record set in 2021 and up 78% from a slight dip in 2022. Given these trends, it’s no surprise that global cybersecurity spending was expected to surpass $200 billion in 2023—an increase of approximately 12% from 2022.

“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft’s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure’s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.”
Overall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of best software infrastructure stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, we believe that certain AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

193,2024-10-01 10:19:43+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Is This A Good Stock to Buy for Long Term?,  Maleha Afzal ,"We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Buy for Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks.
On September 23, Chris Watling, Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate easing path and the impact it may have on the market.
According to Walting, the market is deeply divided on not two but three different sides. While some analysts and investors foresee a recession, others believe the economy is going towards a soft landing, and of those a small minority believe that the economy may accelerate at a rapid pace. Walting also added that while predicting the appropriate terminal rate is interesting, there is a lot more going on with the economy. Comparing economic conditions to the 2008 recession, households and corporations are in much better shape, hinting that a recession may not be the most likely outcome.
He believes that the economy may be slowing right now but it may experience faster reacceleration than before without the need for further falls. His advice to investors is to judge the economy based on multiple data points. As for the appropriate portfolio, Walting suggests that bonds are overcooked and gold must be given a pause. At the moment, the market is rotating away from tech into defensive sectors, and in the future, it may rotate more towards cyclical stocks.
As the S&P 500 recorded an upside following the Fed's easing cycle, investors and analysts alike eye a soft landing for the economy. On September 26, Liz Miller, Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the future of markets.
Miller states that the pivot has been great for the financial markets and now that the Fed is thinking about growth, investors are hopeful of a soft landing. She suggests that stocks in sectors such as housing, rental, finance, and consumer goods may benefit immensely from the easing interest rate cycle.
Miller suggests that the S&P 500 is not the best way to measure the performance of financial markets, given that it is skewed to the mega-cap tech stocks. Looking at other indices, other sectors have not made highs since December 2021. She believes the market may be flat but there is huge potential for upsides. Miller shares concerns over the Chinese economy and how it influences the global outlook. She suggests that for the global economy to balance, companies must work to regain consumer confidence in China.
Now that we have studied the appropriate portfolio mix for investors following the Fed's decision, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term.
Our Methodology 
To come up with the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term we examined promising stocks hedge funds are piling into. These are blue chip stocks with wide moats and have long track records of driving shareholder returns. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

194,2024-09-26 10:43:44+00:00,Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Is Paying Out A Larger Dividend Than Last Year,  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ,"Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) dividend will be increasing from last year's payment of the same period to $0.83 on 12th of December. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 0.8%, which is fairly typical for the industry.
 Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft 
We aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Before making this announcement, Microsoft was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.
The next year is set to see EPS grow by 52.2%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 19% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.
The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $1.12, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $3.32. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.
Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Microsoft has been growing its earnings per share at 18% a year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Microsoft's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.
Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Microsoft is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.
It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Microsoft that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Is Microsoft not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

195,2024-10-11 07:32:00+00:00,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Microsoft, Archrock and Targa Resources",  Zacks Equity Research ,"Chicago, IL – October 11, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Archrock AROC and Targa Resources TRGP.
With the explosion of AI technology and the tremendous energy it demands, business leaders have been frantically searching for new ways to power this technological super-trend. Just for context, if the rate of adoption for AI continues at its current pace, data center energy demand will grow from 3-4% of total power demand to 11-12% by 2030, according to McKinsey. That is a massive increase and if the US is going to keep up, we need to find a solution fast.
In a surprising turn of sentiment, business leaders and policymakers have turned to nuclear energy as a potential solution. Microsoft just recently struck a deal to restart operations at Three-Mile Island, a once shuttered nuclear power plant.
While I am very excited by the resurgence of favorable opinion towards nuclear energy and the attempts to add it back to the energy grid, there is still one major problem. To power the expansion of AI, new power needs to be added to the energy grid immediately, and while nuclear energy has incredible potential, it will be years before the requisite infrastructure gets online to truly expand nuclear capacity. The reality is, there are very few existing nuclear power plants and erecting them takes years.
Fortunately, there is a solution. One energy source that is readily available today, with a well-established infrastructure already in place, is natural gas. I think it is more than likely that natural gas will end up being the primary solution for powering AI, as it is already the leading source of electricity, producing 43% of the country’s electricity.
At this moment in time, we are ahead of the market in realizing just how important natural gas will be for Artificial Intelligence, and it may soon become a major investment theme. Archrock  and Targa Resources are two stocks with top ranks and strong price momentum that should benefit tremendously from this trend.
Archrock is a natural gas compression services company based in the U.S. It focuses on providing natural gas compression equipment, maintenance, and operational support. This service is crucial for the transportation of natural gas through pipelines, as compression is necessary to maintain adequate pressure for efficient transmission over long distances.
Archrock's customers include natural gas producers, processors, and transportation companies. The company's core market benefits from the growing demand for natural gas as a cleaner energy source, especially as the shift toward providing for the AI revolution progresses. The company’s significant presence in the U.S. natural gas industry positions it to capitalize on the ongoing expansion of infrastructure and increasing reliance on natural gas.
In addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, Archrock also boasts a compelling technical chart setup. The stock has gone on a strong run since the start of 2023 but has been consolidating since the end of Q1 this year. Now, the price action is bumping up against the upper level of resistance and with the new catalyst of AI, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a breakout very soon.
Archrock is also currently trading at a reasonable valuation. At 19.8x forward earnings, it is below the market average and its 10-year median of 23.1x. Archrock also pays a tidy 3.1% dividend and has raised the payout by an average of 4.4% annually over the last three years.
Targa Resources is a leading provider of midstream services in the North American energy sector. The company primarily focuses on the gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Targa operates an extensive network of infrastructure, including pipelines, storage facilities, and gas processing plants, which support the efficient movement of natural gas and NGLs from production points to key markets.
Targa Resources is known for its strategic position in key energy-producing regions, such as the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale, enabling it to benefit from rising U.S. energy production. The company plays a crucial role in ensuring the supply chain for natural gas and NGLs remain efficient, supporting the broader energy market. Targa’s financial stability, ongoing infrastructure development, and integrated services make it a prominent player in the energy midstream industry.
Targa Resources enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating led by analysts unanimously upgrading earnings estimates. FY24 earnings estimates have increased by 4.1% in the last two months and are expected to grow 61.2% year-over-year (YoY), while FY25 estimates have jumped by 5.4% and are projected to climb 25.2% YoY.
TRGP is currently trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 27.7x, which is just above the market average, but below its 10-year median of 28.3x. Targa Resources also has a dividend yield of 1.8% and has raised the payment by an average of 31% annually over the last five years.
Both Archrock and Targa Resources present compelling opportunities for investors seeking exposure to the natural gas industry, particularly as this energy source gains renewed importance in the age of AI and increased energy demand.
Both stocks are well-positioned to benefit from the next commodity megatrend driven by the AI revolution's energy demands. Archrock provides a more value-oriented play with steady income, while Targa Resources offers a growth narrative backed by its pivotal role in the midstream natural gas sector. Investors looking to ride the wave of increased natural gas usage may find both stocks appealing, depending on their investment style and objectives.
Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.

197,2024-10-09 16:19:00+00:00,"Instructure Integrates Microsoft Reflect with Canvas LMS, Expands Mental Wellness Resources Ahead of World Mental Health Day",PR Newswire ,"SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Instructure, the leading learning technology ecosystem and maker of Canvas LMS, is proud to announce a newly available complimentary integration of Microsoft Reflect into Canvas, a step designed to enhance global mental wellness support for students and educators just in time for World Mental Health Day on October 10. The integration aims to streamline social-emotional learning (SEL) within the digital classroom, through K-12 to higher education, making mental wellness resources more accessible to all Canvas users.
""Integrating Microsoft Reflect within Canvas makes it an even more powerful platform to support student learning and wellbeing,"" said Elad Graiver, Principal Product Manager at Microsoft Education. ""By embedding SEL check-ins into daily routines, schools create a space for student voice, giving every learner the opportunity to share their thoughts and feelings openly. This immediate feedback empowers educators to make timely adjustments, fostering a more supportive and engaging classroom environment.""
To further support mental wellness initiatives, Instructure recently introduced a new Mental Wellness Hub within its Community. This collaborative online space is where 2.25 million educators and learners connect to share and enhance the learning experience. The Wellness Hub serves as a central resource, offering best practices, professional development and a supportive forum for educators and administrators to discuss strategies for promoting mental health in educational settings.
""At Instructure, we believe mental wellness is foundational to successful learning,"" said Melissa Loble, Chief Academic Officer at Instructure. ""We're committed to supporting the whole learner by providing tools and resources that foster emotional well-being and create a positive, supportive environment for both students and educators. When mental health is prioritized, meaningful learning and growth can truly thrive.""
Instructure's focus on mental health reflects a broader trend in education: the increasing need to address students' and educators' emotional well-being as a key component of academic success. Recent research by the Healthy Minds Network, which surveys tens of thousands of students across the United States each year about mental health, indicates that almost 40% of students screened positive for moderate or severe depressive symptoms. In comparison, 68% of faculty felt ""overwhelmed"" by all they had to do, making accessible mental wellness tools more essential than ever.
The integration and new Hub will be spotlighted on Instructure's social channels throughout October, featuring tips, resources, and podcasts to help educators use these tools effectively. World Mental Health Day reminds us of the importance of fostering healthy, supportive learning environments, and Instructure is dedicated to providing its community with the resources it needs to make mental health a priority – today and every day.

198,2024-09-30 14:00:02+00:00,How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation,  keniofontes ,"Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is still the second most valuable company on the planet, narrowly beaten by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Among the 10 largest companies in the United States, some stand out for being traded at above-market multiples, such as the two already mentioned, but also Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Of all these, some require very aggressive projections or accept a low margin of safety to justify the valuation, such as Tesla, where it is necessary to consider substantial increases in fundamentals through the FSD, or Apple where the high price-to-earnings does not go well with growth prospects, but this is not really the case with Microsoft.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MSFT.
Even though it is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio very similar to Apple's, Microsoft is expected to grow faster and has very solid competitive advantages that guarantee good sustainability, and it is also possible to benefit from various opportunities since its revenue is very diversified.
Microsoft divides its revenue sources into three main ones: Productivity and Business Processes, which is the portion that encompasses Office Commercial, Office Consumer, LinkedIn, and Dynamics business solutions, represented 31% of revenue in FYQ4; Intelligent Cloud, which encompasses server products and cloud services such as Azure, Visual Studio, GitHub and others, represented 44% of revenue in the last quarter; and finally, More Personal Computing, which corresponds to revenue generated by Windows, Gaming (Xbox and the like), search and news, represented 25% of revenue in the last quarter.
Note that even if we divide the revenues into three, there are an infinite number of sub-segments within each one, and although they have divergent perspectives, the vast majority are good businesses that manage to make significant progress in terms of revenue and still do so steadily, supported by the competitive advantages of each one.
Windows, for example, is present on more than 70% of desktops, and with this data alone, it would be possible to compile a list of competitive advantages, such as gains in scale, cross-selling power, lock-in effect, better compatibility, and so on. Not to mention Office 365 and its applications, which are used by thousands of huge companies that need to use Microsoft products on a daily basis, not only on Windows, but also on Macs and cell phones, and although there are alternatives that could threaten this market share - such as the tools from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) - the level of loyalty is very high.
These characteristics reflect directly on Microsoft's fundamentals, with the power to improve its recurring revenue, pass on inflation to the price of its services, grow on other fronts, the company has been able to grow its revenue per share by an average of 12.2% and its EPS growth by 20.9% over the last 20 years, while in the same period, EPS growth was 20.9%, also showing the improvement in net income margin.
Source: GuruFocus
With these moats and stability, it is already possible to infer that Microsoft deserves a multiple at least in relation to the average of its market, for differing in quality.
In the most recent quarter (Fiscal Q4), this positive trend continued, with Microsoft growing all three of these main revenue lines by double digits, resulting in a consolidated growth of 15%. Drilling down a little further, the highlights were server products and cloud services, which increased by 21%, and Xbox content and services, which increased by 61% but were impacted by the Activision acquisition, while Office Consumer products only increased by 3%.
Source: Microsoft's presentation
For the next few years, these good figures will continue (depending on the year and the analyst, it could even be more optimistic in fact). According to the forecast, the average revenue growth for the next 3 fiscal years is ~14.3% and for EPS this is even better, with growth of just over 15% and reaching $17.98 EPS in fiscal year 2026.
Constructing a scenario where Microsoft maintains growth close to 15% is quite reasonable. I'd even say easy. Its more traditional part, Productivity and Business Processes, has the capacity to maintain price adjustments, continue acquiring new customers, and also benefit from secular trends in productivity, cybersecurity, and AI, since the trend is for Office 365 to become increasingly complete and integrated.
More personal computing should be driven by trends such as the new Copilot PCs that can help increase sales, improve the operating system update cycle, and the like. Copilot subscriptions alone could also show significant growth over the next few years, especially with a view to more widespread adoption.
The cloud division, which is already the largest part of revenue, also has secular trends and is still one of the pillars for the advance of Artificial Intelligence. In the last earnings call, it was mentioned that the Azure AI customer base reached 60,000 customers, growing 60% YoY.
Some more macro trends, such as the acquisition of customers in emerging markets and small and medium-sized businesses that don't yet have access to these products and services, could also continue to drive the growth of Microsoft's financials.
What bothers me is that while it's easy to understand scenarios where the company grows close to 15% over the next few years, it's difficult to perpetuate this for a few decades. It is possible for a company that already has revenues of close to $250bn and a net income of almost $90bn to continue growing at an accelerated rate, but this may become increasingly difficult. New ventures, for example, will need to mature more and more if they are to make any difference to annual growth, and at some point, it may become more difficult to acquire new customers around the world.
Considering the growth mentioned in the previous section, in a few years this premium would already become something closer to the index average, taking the average of the 2026 EPS estimates, the price-to-earnings would be just over 24x, a value that seems quite reasonable considering that we are talking about one of the most consolidated companies in the world and one that still has a lot to grow. Doing the same with Apple, the price-to-earnings for fiscal year 2026 would be ~27.2x, a higher level even if it is driven by large buybacks.
Historically, Microsoft has traded at a higher multiple than Apple, but in recent years this gap has been narrowing. In the latest data, Microsoft stocks were trading at 31.8x earnings, while Apple was trading at 30.5x, and although both are excellent companies with good prospects and competitive advantages, Microsoft's growth is a little more reliable (and will probably be higher at least in the short and medium term). It's also worth noting that Apple is trading at a higher premium compared to its own history since the mean of its indicator is ~21.3x while Microsoft's is 26.8x.
Source: GuruFocus
As the scenario for Microsoft's growth is clearer and the company continues to be one of the main players that will benefit from the AI trend, this premium in relation to both the market and its own history seems reasonable to me. Another factor that supports the bullish thesis is that there may be positive surprises along the way, especially considering the company's good track record of management, capital allocation, and the like.
This valuation level is even better justified considering the quality. Microsoft is a unique company and ends up being barely comparable with the market average and even with the US Treasury. Many investors may prefer to expose themselves to the 10-year treasury which is paying ~3.7% than to buy Microsoft which has an earnings/market cap ratio of ~2.7%, but it is necessary to consider that by fiscal year 2026, this earnings yield should exceed 4%.
Traditionally, a DCF should consider a more robust equity risk premium, so for Microsoft's current price to work in a DCF model, it is necessary to either consider that it will be able to maintain growth of ~15% for two decades, or discount this cash flow at a very small rate (like 5% or 6%).
In short, there isn't a huge asymmetry or bargain here, but you can still justify Microsoft's price without too much trouble.
In view of the information above, although Microsoft is far from undervalued, its valuation can be well justified without overly optimistic assumptions or giving up the entire margin of safety. Of course, here the investor is trading upside for quality and stability but still exposing himself to a growth company that could surprise positively in various segments over the next decade, which could then become an interesting option for adding predictability to the portfolio.

199,2024-09-22 09:20:00+00:00,Microsoft Goes Nuclear. Here Are the Biggest Beneficiaries of Its Massive Power Grab.,"  Matt DiLallo, The Motley Fool ","Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is investing heavily in building out data centers to support the growth of its cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) operations. Those facilities require tremendous power, especially when used for AI. For example, AI applications like ChatGPT require 10 times the electricity to process a search query compared to a typical Google search.
That's leading Microsoft to secure power to support its growth ambitions. It recently signed a deal to buy nuclear energy produced by Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG). It also signed a massive renewable energy deal with Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP). These agreements will help ensure Microsoft has the power it needs to thrive in the future.
Microsoft recently signed a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with leading nuclear energy producer Constellation Energy. The deal will help launch the Crane Clean Energy Center by restarting Three Mile Island Unit 1. The company had shut down that unit five years ago for operational and economic reasons. It will now bring it back online to supply Microsoft's data centers with carbon-free energy for decades to come.
Constellation Energy expects the restarted nuclear-generating unit, renamed after its former CEO, to begin producing power by 2028. It will mark the country's first-ever restart of a previously retired nuclear power plant. The company plans to invest about $1.6 billion to bring the plant back online.
It would have the capacity to generate 835 megawatts (MW) of carbon-free electricity and could operate through at least 2054. The 20-year agreement for capacity at the revamped Crane Clean Energy Center is the largest-ever PPA signed by Constellation Energy. It will supply the power company with steady income for the next two decades.
Three Mile Island Unit 1 is next to the notorious Unit 2, which shut down in 1979 after a partial meltdown. That accident, the most famous one in the country, didn't impact Unit 1. Constellation Energy won't restart that second unit.
Constellation Energy isn't the only company benefiting from Microsoft's need for power. The tech titan signed a massive collaboration agreement with Brookfield Renewable in May. The deal will see the leading global renewable energy producer deliver over 10.5 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable power capacity by 2030.
That agreement is the largest corporate PPA ever signed, nearly eight times bigger than the prior record. It provides a pathway for Brookfield to build and deliver 10.5 GW of new renewable energy capacity in the U.S. and Europe to support Microsoft's cloud and AI expansions while helping it achieve its goal of having 100% of its power come from zero-carbon energy by 2030. It builds on their existing agreements where Brookfield is supplying Microsoft with nearly 1 GW of power capacity.
While that deal initially covers renewable energy in the U.S. and Europe, it could expand to other regions, like Asia-Pacific, India, and Latin America, where Brookfield also has a strong operating presence. Further, it will focus beyond wind and solar to include new or impactful carbon-free energy-generation technologies.
Meanwhile, Microsoft's support for nuclear energy could also benefit Brookfield. While it doesn't operate nuclear power facilities, it has investments in Westinghouse, a leading global nuclear services business. Westinghouse could help restart dormant nuclear power plants and build new nuclear capacity, such as small modular reactors.
The next two decades will be an unprecedented period for electricity buildout globally to support the growth of cloud computing, AI, electric vehicles, and other demand drivers. Microsoft is ensuring it stays ahead of this curve by grabbing as much power as possible to support its growth ambitions. That's fueling growth for Constellation Energy and Brookfield Renewable, which should expand briskly for years to come, making them great stocks to buy for those seeking to capitalize on the coming power boom.

200,2024-09-29 22:02:15+00:00,Is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Edge in AI Fading Away?,  Attiya Zainib ,"We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.
Chris Hyzy, Merrill & Bank of America Private Bank chief investment officer, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that there is “ a lot of momentum” behind the market rally. The analyst said that to gauge how much momentum we have behind the optimism, we need to analyze the “wedge” in the market.
“The biggest wedge that was in the market last year and in 2022 was inflation. That’s beginning to go away. It’s almost to the fact that no one’s is talking about whether or not we are going to have inflation that’s worrisome.”
Hyzy said that the Fed easing its fiscal policy and now China “joining the party” will be two key tailwinds for the market.
Answering a question about the hard landing vs soft landing debate, the analyst said we should look beyond the two possibilities as he believes there are many other scenarios to consider in between these two outcomes.
“We have a lot of components of a soft landing. I’d like to say it’s more of a mid-cycle slowdown with easier financial conditions that should actually create a profit revision to the upside not downside,” Hyzy added.
For this article we picked top 10 trending AI stocks on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Some believe OpenAI was the only key edge Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) had in the AI race and it’s quickly fading away.
DA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company’s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum.
Luria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA’s, according to Luria.
Following a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft’s dependence on NVIDIA.
Luria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins.
The analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities.
The concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta’s Llama 3.1.
Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft’s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure’s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.”
Overall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

202,2024-09-27 17:00:00+00:00,Microsoft’s Maligned AI-Enabled ‘Recall’ Gets a Security Reboot,  Andrew Martin ,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has announced upgrades for Recall, an artificial intelligence feature that creates a record of everything users do on their PCs, following criticism that the tool created an attractive target for hackers.

In an interview Thursday, David Weston, a vice president for enterprise and operating system security, said the company heard the critiques “loud and clear” and set about devising layers of security safeguards for Recall designed to thwart even the world’s most sophisticated hackers.
In the soon-to-be-released version, users will be able to filter out specific apps or websites. Sensitive content filtering — which looks for such things as Social Security numbers or credit card numbers — will be on by default. In-private browsing in supported applications won’t saved, Weston said.
Users can only enable Recall and use it by authenticating themselves using biometric features such as facial recognition or a fingerprint. Data collected by Recall will be stored in an isolated environment, and only information requested by a user will leave that secure space.
Microsoft says Recall is intended to serve as “an explorable timeline of your PC’s past,” making it easier to sort through it and search. The technology takes periodic snapshots of a computer screen that are stored and analyzed.
Soon after Recall was announced in May, security researchers warned that bad actors could access and scoop up records gathered by the tool and stored locally on a user’s PC. Those criticisms came as Microsoft was already combating criticism of its internal security practices following a number of high-profile hacks.
In June, Microsoft said recall would be shipped in the “off” position on its line of AI-branded PCs. That will continue, with users being required to opt-in to use Recall.
In the new version of Recall, sensitive data is encrypted with keys and isolated on a user’s machine, so that even if a computer is infected with malware or stolen, a bad actor won’t be able to access it, Weston said. A biometric match is required to decrypt the data, he said.
Recall will also time out if it’s not being used — the default is 15 minutes — but can be adjusted. “We want people to have it when they need it but not have it hanging around,” he said.
The revised product will be available to consumers in a beta version next month. Recall only operates on Copilot+ PCs, a new class of Windows 11 machines. However, the upgraded Recall won’t be automatically installed on business versions of those PCs, though companies can download it, Weston said.

203,2024-10-12 09:10:00+00:00,"1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock-Split Stock Set to Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club","  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ","Each of the six publicly traded companies with a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion has played a significant role in the advancement and development of artificial intelligence (AI). Four of them have split their stocks in the last five years.
It might not be long before another AI stock-split stock joins the ranks. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has emerged as a key supplier of AI data-center chip designs, complementing its other semiconductor designs and enterprise-software business.
With its market capitalization around $850 billion, as of this writing, Broadcom needs to gain 18% to reach the $1 trillion milestone. Here's why it's bound to get there.
Broadcom's roots are in semiconductor design, and it has developed a strong portfolio of intellectual property that has served it well in the AI arms race among big tech companies.
Broadcom's networking chips are essential infrastructure for AI data centers. While Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) get all the headlines, it's Broadcom's chips that allow a company to get the most out of the billions of dollars it is spending on those GPUs. Broadcom's networking chips ensure data moves quickly and efficiently from one server to another, improving the efficiency of the data center. No company can compete with Broadcom's technology in this arena, and few customers would risk switching to a competitor due to the potential impact of using an inferior chip design and other switching costs.
Broadcom also has a growing custom chip-design business fueled by AI spending. Broadcom designs Alphabet's tensor processing unit (TPU), which Apple used to train its Apple Intelligence large language model (LLM). It's also behind Meta's MTIA chips, which help train and run Meta's Llama model. Generative AI leader, OpenAI, is reportedly working with Broadcom for its own custom-chip designs as well.
Broadcom isn't just an AI chipmaker, though. It holds a dominant position in wireless phone chips that improve 5G reception while extending battery life. It also makes WiFi and Bluetooth chips. Its chips are found in Apple's iPhone as well as in many other high-end smartphones.
Broadcom has also made strategic acquisitions of enterprise software providers over the last few years, including Symantec and VMWare. It uses a land-and-expand strategy focused on selling multiple software solutions to a small group of large enterprise customers. That provides a growing and very sticky source of recurring revenue.
Broadcom's networking chips are already essential infrastructure for AI. Over the next few years, more and more big tech companies will likely come to rely on its custom AI accelerators as well. Google and Meta are already spending heavily on custom silicon designed by Broadcom.
As AI development matures, investors can expect a greater focus on custom-chip designs like Google and Meta's. That's because these chips can be less expensive than general-purpose GPUs, and they use less energy for the same tasks. As a result, I expect them to account for a growing share of silicon in AI data centers.
Broadcom's AI chips business is still a small piece of its operations, but it's growing extremely quickly. Its ethernet switching-chip sales grew more than 4x year over year in the third quarter, and AI accelerator sales grew 3.5x year over year. Both should continue to drive strong results for Broadcom into the future.
Broadcom's stock currently trades for about 29.5 times earnings estimates for 2025.
Broadcom should see improved earnings performance next year as it trims excess operating expenses related to its acquisition of VMWare in late 2023. Those trims should result in strong operating margin expansion. Even better, the long-term potential for operating leverage remains high even as its AI chips business scales and it builds its recurring revenue enterprise software business. Over time, Broadcom should see earnings growth outpace revenue growth.
AI chips could drive extremely strong revenue growth over the next few years. And with improved operating leverage, it should produce the earnings growth needed to justify its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.
In order to reach a $1 trillion valuation, Broadcom stock will have to reach a share price of about $214. That would put its valuation at roughly the same 29 times forward P/E at the end of next year based on current analysts' estimates. If Broadcom can outperform expectations, it might reach the $1 trillion milestone even sooner.
Based on its current price and the current outlook for the business, it looks like the stock trades for fair value and could be worth a spot in your portfolio.

The latest developments in the AI industry from a business perspective highlight a growing momentum, driven by significant investments, innovative product launches, and both regulatory and market challenges. One notable development is the rise of Safe Superintelligence, a company founded by previous OpenAI bigwig Ilya Sutskever, which recently secured $1 billion in funding to advance AI systems with a focus on safety. This significant capital raise from major venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital underscores the growing concerns around AI safety, as companies work to ensure that AI technologies are both powerful and aligned with human values. Similarly, the market selloff of Wall Street's favorite GPU maker following a stellar earnings report, resulting in a market value loss of close to $280 billion, reflects investor anxieties over the sustainability of AI growth, compounded by concerns over regulatory scrutiny.

Another major business development that investors should keep an eye on is the purchase of  AirTrunk by investment firm Blackstone for over $16 billion. AirTrunk, a data center operator, significantly boosts the position of the investment titan in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. Data centers are expected to require up to $2 trillion in investment globally over the next five years to meet the demands of AI technologies, and the AirTrunk acquisition signals strong confidence in this growth by top investment managers. Data center expansions are critical as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic roll out enterprise-grade AI services, which demand immense computing power. For example, Anthropic recently launched Claude Enterprise, a robust AI chatbot, that caters to organizations that need advanced features like larger context windows and GitHub integration, aiming to streamline business operations through AI.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. Latest reports indicate that OpenAI, the generative artificial intelligence startup backed by Microsoft,  has crossed the 1 million paid users barrier in the ChatGPT for business section. OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022 to kickstart the AI boom. The tech giant has invested more than $10 billion in the AI startup already, and is potentially considering another large investment, along with Apple and NVIDIA, as the valuation of the startup touches close to $100 billion. OpenAI is considering higher-priced subscriptions to ChatGPT, perhaps $2,000 per month, as it launches new models like Strawberry and Orion.
DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria recently downgraded Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged price target of $475. In a research note, the analyst noted that competition had largely caught up with Microsoft on the AI front, which reduced the justification for the current premium valuation. The note further claimed that Microsoft's lead had now diminished in both the cloud business and code generation business, which would make it hard for shares to continue to outperform.
Overall MSFT ranks 6th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

205,2024-09-27 09:43:43+00:00,Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) the Best NASDAQ Stock to Invest In Right Now?,  Ashar Jawad ,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks.
This year has been a healthy year for the American stock market, fueled by a strong performance from technology stocks. Several indices capped their best week of the year in early September as stocks rose ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting where the central bank was expected to cut interest rates. NASDAQ has led the charge and registered a 20% growth during the first half.
While the index lists over 3,100 companies from various sectors, the rally has been led by its top seven holdings which account for 52% of the index. All of them being tech stocks. There is a mix of optimism and skepticism among investors on whether NASDAQ will be able to continue its good run over the second half of the year. Historical data over the past decade shows that in most instances, NASDAQ has finished stronger during the back half of the year. There have only been two years between 2014 and 2023 during which NASDAQ’s year-end returns were lower than first-half returns.
However, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, told CNBC earlier this month that investors need to be cautious, as stocks could fall 10% during the next eight weeks amid interest rate cuts and the nervousness around the upcoming presidential elections. The co-founder of the research firm also suggested that if the dip is too strong, it should be viewed as a buying opportunity for investors. Lee has largely been on the money and nailed most stock calls this year.
Other analysts also anticipate market volatility ahead of the presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider noted that stock activity lags between June and August while traders are on vacation. This results in strong market performance aided by thinner trade volumes. The activity jumps up significantly in September when they return to their desks, which often leads to stock price volatility. According to her, a two percent shift in share price in either direction has become the norm in September. However, during election years, the volatility is at its peak in mid-October instead of September, and the market returns to normalcy after the results are announced.
LPL Financial's Adam Turnquist also expects seasonal shakiness in the months ahead, but pointed out, like Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes.
Buying the September or October lows has been a very good trade. October, things start to improve, and then you have this November, December, year-end rally, typically very high average returns and high positivity rates for those months.
Both Turnquist and Young Thomas agreed that existing portfolios should not be readjusted because of seasonal volatility because it is short-term and hard to forecast.
With that said, let’s head over to see some of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy right now, given the current trends and future projections.
We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 to look for stocks listed on NASDAQ and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American multinational company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, which is best known for its software products and operating systems. It has nearly tripled its valuation over the last three years and reached the $3 trillion mark. It is the second most valuable corporation in the world.
According to Insider Monkey's database, 279 hedge funds held stakes in the company as of the second quarter of 2024. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to garner immense investor confidence through its strong financial performance. During Q4 2024, the company generated a revenue of $64.7 billion, which took the annual revenue to $245 billion, representing a 15% increase year-over-year. EPS for the quarter registered a 10% growth to reach $2.95 per share, beating analysts' expectations of $2.94.
These robust results were largely driven by Microsoft Cloud, which contributed $135 billion of the company’s overall revenue in FY2024, up 23% YoY. The company’s commercial bookings also registered a 17% increase, driven by millions of dollars of contracts for both Microsoft 365 and Azure, indicating strong customer commitment. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) anticipates the trends to continue in FY25 and has projected double-digit growth for both revenue and operating income for the year.
Another reason behind investor confidence is the company’s increased spending on AI and cloud infrastructure. Microsoft spent $19 billion in capital expenditure in Q4 alone, and investors believe that this increased spending will help the company stay at par with, if not outperform, competitors in the market. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses, both large and small, navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company’s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all scales. Microsoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and the adoption of innovative, AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft’s solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low-double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.
There were some segments where revenue decreased. Xbox hardware sales declined 42% during the quarter and devices revenue also experienced an 11% dip. However, the company believes this was due to their focus being more on other premium products with a higher profit margin. On the whole, there is consensus among Street analysts about Microsoft being one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. It has a Strong Buy rating and a 12.60% upward potential in share price.
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

206,2024-09-23 15:00:27+00:00,Microsoft CEO to Cyber Team: Don’t Tell Me How Great Everything Is,  Dina Bass ,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp., aiming to shore up cybersecurity after a series of damning failures, has hired new executives from places like the US government and is holding weekly meetings with its most senior executives to advance a companywide initiative to make its software more resilient.

Timothy Langan, a 26-year FBI veteran, has been hired as deputy chief information security officer for government, while Shawn Bowen, a past CISO for the United States Marine Corps Intelligence, will take a deputy CISO role for gaming. Microsoft has also given such longtime executives as Azure Chief Technology Officer Mark Russinovich and cybersecurity Vice President John Lambert new deputy CISO duties, part of a group of 13 executives with that title.
The software maker said it now has the equivalent of 34,000 full-time engineers working on security.
The moves are part of the company’s effort to assure customers, including the US government, that it’s making progress on its Secure Future Initiative, the biggest overhaul to its cybersecurity posture in more than two decades after a series of damaging hacks and a government report that described the company’s security culture as in need of urgent reforms.
Microsoft unveiled the initiative in November and named a new chief information security officer in December. In May, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella ordered the company’s engineers to prioritize security above all else, including new product development. The company is also now grappling with how to adjust the way security partners release products that involve its Windows software after a flawed update from CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. triggered a global IT meltdown.
The key challenge for Microsoft is finding a balance between cybersecurity and competitive pressure to release updates quickly and create new technologies, especially in artificial intelligence. “Customers are yelling at you every day that they want a new feature,” said Microsoft security chief Charlie Bell in an interview. “But they’re not yelling at you every day about the threat of a bad actor.”
The conflict between the two imperatives became plain in May, when the AI team unveiled a Windows feature that creates a record of everything users do on their PCs. Named Recall, the product alarmed security experts and had to be pulled back to make adjustments.
“What we learned from Recall was that we still have the work to do,” said Ann Johnson, a longtime security industry executive who moved from Microsoft’s business development group to one of the new deputy CISO roles earlier this year. The answer, she said, is to provide clear guidance to teams — standardized tools and checklists — to ensure that all new features and code meet company security standards. “Then they can put out anything, and we’re not in their way,” Johnson said.
Other deputy CISO’s include Vanessa Feliberti Bautista, a three-decade Microsoft veteran, who will keep tabs on security in Microsoft’s 365 corporate products, and Geoff Belknap, former CISO at LinkedIn and Slack, who will look after Microsoft’s core infrastructure as well as acquisitions.
In another sign of Microsoft’s renewed seriousness about product safety, Nadella now devotes an hour during regular Friday leadership meetings to assessing and troubleshooting the security initiative, Bell said. Nadella specifically asked that updates focus on pain points that still need to be addressed. “You’re going to embrace the red,” Bell said Nadella told the executives. “I don’t want a show telling me how great everything is.”
Nadella also asked his team to stop dwelling on whether complaints about Microsoft’s cybersecurity issues were fair and focus on fixes.
“Just do the work,” Bell said Nadella told Microsoft’s leaders.

Vodafone will purchase 68,000 licenses for corporate versions of the assistants, known as Copilots, after early trials found workers using them saved about three hours a week per person, Microsoft said in a blog post shared ahead of a webcast Monday. Other clients include Honeywell International Inc. and financial services firm Finastra Group Holdings Ltd. Microsoft said Copilot customers increased by more than 60% in the most recent quarter, compared with the previous period, while the number of clients with more than 10,000 users doubled. The company didn’t disclose overall customer totals.
Microsoft has been infusing its product line with AI technology from partner OpenAI and is touting the new features as a second wave of business-oriented Copilots, AI tools designed to turbocharge programs like Teams conferencing software, Word and Outlook, among other applications.
Connecting popular Office software to AI models from OpenAI helps differentiate Microsoft’s products from rival offerings, including OpenAI’s own. OpenAI last week released a new model, called o1, that can perform some human-like reasoning tasks, and Microsoft said Monday that it would integrate the technology in its own products at some point.
Microsoft has cited strong demand for the earlier versions of the products, and customers praise some of their capabilities, especially the ability to summarize meetings and documents. The Copilots cost $30 a month per user and could one day become a major new revenue stream.
But many features remain a work in progress — generating new content has been more unreliable and the same is true of using the AI tools for things like spreadsheets or tasks that require understanding context. In recent months, skittish investors have signaled impatience with tech companies’ efforts to profit from their massive investments in AI.
Microsoft is also rolling out a new feature for Copilot’s chat application called Pages, which gives coworkers a space to work together using data they create and as well as content generated by the AI software. Pages saves the AI-generated material in one place and lets workers edit and share it with other employees. The new feature is being released Monday and will be widely available later this month. “You can ideate with AI and collaborate with other people,” said Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella.
Microsoft is also widely releasing its Copilot tools for the Excel spreadsheet app, which will help users create charts and pivot tables. The Excel Copilot can also work with text data and use the Python programming language for things like forecasts and risk analysis. The Python features, in preview now, are accessible using regular language instead of programming code.
The software giant announced new AI features for Word, Teams and PowerPoint. A new Prioritize My Inbox option in Outlook analyzes a user’s messages based on what emails they respond to and who they report to in the office in order to help declutter. The program, which will be available to preview late this year, also summarizes the messages and explains why they’ve been prioritized.
(Updated with timing of new Pages feature. A previous version of this story corrected company name spelling in web headline.)

209,2024-09-26 12:30:02+00:00,Is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) the Best AI Dividend Stock to Buy Now?,  Attiya Zainib ,"We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. Since Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.
Investors are still digesting the Fed’s aggressive rate cut and charting the path forward. Roger Altman, Evercore founder and senior chairman, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the Fed was not “behind the curve” but it went with a higher-than-expected rate cut amid labor market concerns.
Asked if he thinks we are headed toward a soft landing scenario, Altman said yes, as he believes growth is “resilient” and corporate profit outlook is good. Altman said equity markets are headed to have their best year since 1960.
“If the landing is finished and the Fed hits its target, Powell will deserve an A and it would be a pretty miraculous achievement,” Altman said.
While the analyst believes currently it’s a “near perfect” overall environment for the market, he did point to “storm clouds” gathering over the international stage including the expanding crisis in the Middle East, Russia’s war on Ukraine and America’s overall fiscal situation.
For this article we chose 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is trending after the company announced a dividend hike and a $60 billion stock buyback program. Mizuho Securities recently reaffirmed its Outperform rating on the stock with a $480 price target, with analyst Gregg Moskowitz noting that the buyback amount matches what was announced three years ago, and no change is expected in the repurchase pace.
Moskowitz highlighted Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) long-term growth potential, emphasizing the significant opportunities from generative AI adoption and the company’s ability to monetize it.
Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares fell following its latest quarterly results which showed the company’s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year. But what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office’s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year’s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year’s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year’s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features. While Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and would bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year’s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.
Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses, both large and small, navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company’s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all scales. Microsoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of innovative, AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT, while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft’s solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low-double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.”
Overall, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Constellation Energy Corp., the biggest US operator of reactors, expects Three Mile Island to go back into service in 2028, according to a statement Friday. While one of the site’s two units permanently closed almost a half-century ago after the worst US nuclear accident, Constellation is planning to reopen the other reactor, which shut in 2019 because it couldn’t compete economically.
Shares of Constellation Energy jumped as much as 22%, the most on record, to an all-time high on Friday.
Microsoft has agreed to purchase the energy for two decades and declined to disclose financial terms. This is the first time Microsoft has secured a dedicated, 100% nuclear facility for its use.
The decision is the latest sign of surging interest in the nuclear industry as power demand for AI soars. More than a dozen reactors went dark over roughly the past decade in the face of increasing competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. But growing demand for electricity — from factories, cars and especially from data centers — has spurred interest in nuclear plants that can provide carbon-free power around the clock.
“Policymakers and the market have received a huge wake-up call,” Constellation Chief Executive Officer Joe Dominguez said in an interview. “There’s no version of the future of this country that doesn’t rely on these nuclear assets.”
Constellation — which has seen its shares jump this year thanks to mounting investor awareness of the value of power plants — plans to fund the project from its own coffers rather than seek state or federal support. That’s in contrast to Holtec International, which is pursuing the only other disclosed effort to restart a closed reactor, with about $1.8 billion in conditional funding from the US Energy Department and the state of Michigan. NextEra Energy Inc. has also said it’s considering reviving a closed Iowa reactor, in part to supply data-center customers. However, beyond these three, experts say there are few other mothballed reactors that may be suitable for restarting.
While Constellation isn’t averse to outside financial support, Dominguez said government approvals move slowly and he doesn’t want to wait. Work at Three Mile Island is expected to start immediately. The deal to supply Microsoft with electricity from the 837-megawatt reactor is Constellation’s biggest-ever power purchase deal.
The restart effort has been in the works since early 2023, when Constellation began evaluating whether it made sense to switch the reactor back on. By early this year, the company had concluded that it wanted to pursue the project, and began talking to potential customers. Microsoft was immediately interested, Dominguez said.
The nuclear power purchase will aid Microsoft’s plans to run all of its massive global network of data centers on clean energy by 2025, Bobby Hollis, Microsoft’s vice president for energy, said in an interview. This nuclear energy will be used to fuel data-center expansion in areas like Chicago, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
While the additional nuclear power will help Microsoft’s climate goals, it does not address the most intractable issue – emissions from concrete, steel and chips used in the data centers, Hollis said.
“This is not a simple piece, but it’s easier than figuring out how to decarbonize the entire supply chain,” he said.
Still, data centers make a useful customer for nuclear power. Wind and solar power outputs can vary, while a nuclear plant generally runs constantly and requires a customer that can take all of that electricity, Hollis said. That makes tech companies selling cloud computing an ideal option.
“We run around the clock. They run around the clock,” he said.
Microsoft isn't the only tech company looking to nuclear power to fuel its AI ambitions. Earlier this year, Amazon.com Inc.'s cloud computing division agreed to spend $650 million to acquire a data center campus connected to Talen Energy Corp.’s 40-year-old nuclear power plant on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania.
While the Three Mile Island reactor was mothballed in 2019, Dominguez said the equipment is still in good shape. Still, restarting it will require significant investments in the main transformer, turbine and cooling systems. The company will have to restaff the facility and must seek approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Constellation will also seek to extend its operating license through 2054, and is planning to rename the facility the Crane Clean Energy Center, after the late Chris Crane, former CEO of Exelon Corp., which spun out its generation unit to become Constellation in 2022.
One of the biggest hurdles will be connecting the plant to the power grid operated by PJM Interconnection LLC, which has a lengthy queue. If PJM can move fast enough, Dominguez said the facility could potentially be ready to supply power as early as 2027.
“I’m so glad we’re reversing a terrible mistake that shouldn’t have happened,” he said. “It will be a lot more difficult to achieve the energy transition if we only want to use wind and solar and storage.”

211,2024-10-12 10:25:00+00:00,Gates says Sanders would get rid of 99% of his wealth — what the Microsoft founder loves most about being rich,  Jing Pan ,"It’s no secret that Bernie Sanders is not a fan of extreme wealth. The U.S. Senator has famously argued that billionaires shouldn’t exist, remarking to CNN’s Chris Wallace in 2023 that people can “make it” on $999 million.
So, what happens when one of the world’s richest individuals, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, crosses paths with Sanders?
Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month
5 ways to boost your net worth now — easily up your money game without altering your day-to-day life
Private real estate is not just for the ultra-rich anymore– find out how you can get in on this inflation-resistant investment for as little as $10.
During a Sept. 25 appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” Gates shared the story of an encounter between them sparked by the filming of an episode of the billionaire’s Netflix docuseries “What's Next? The Future With Bill Gates.”
“He’s kind of predictable, he wishes we were rich enough that we could be more generous,” Gates said, reflecting on his meeting with Sanders.
Gates highlighted the complexities of Sanders’s vision, questioning, “How do you raise that revenue without destroying the capitalistic system that makes the U.S. the envy of the world?”
As part of the Netflix episode, titled “Can You Be Too Rich?,” Gates says he sought diverse perspectives. It includes interviews with Sanders, Mark Cuban, U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney and former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, among others. Gates acknowledged that he's open to paying more in taxes, but not to the level Sanders advocates.
“I told Bernie that I would make the tax system more progressive, I would have paid twice as much in taxes, but I would still be a billionaire. So he would get rid of 99% of my money, I’d only get rid of 50% of it,” Gates told Stephen Colbert.
Colbert pointed out that even under Sanders's plan, Gates would remain extremely wealthy.
“But if you get rid of 99% of your money, you'd still be a multibillionaire,” Colbert remarked.
Gates quickly interjected, “No, no, no.”
Forbes pegs Gates’s net worth at $100-plus billion. If he were to suddenly lose 99% of his wealth, while no longer being a multibillionaire he’d still be a member of the three-comma club.
The broadcasted exchange caught the attention of Sanders himself, who posted a clip of the conversation on social media, adding, “Bill Gates agrees we need a more progressive tax system.
“Of course, if he got rid of 99% of his money, he would still be a billionaire.”

Sanders has made it clear that his stance isn't a personal attack on any individual billionaire, but rather ""an attack upon a system."" He also emphasized that he doesn’t intend to devalue hard work. Instead, his belief that billionaires shouldn’t exist stems from concerns over the extreme inequality in society today.
“Do I think people who work hard, create new businesses should become rich? I do. Do I think they should have $50 billion or $100 billion when you have got a half a million people who are homeless in America today, when you have 85 million people who can't afford health insurance? No, I don't,” he told Wallace.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s latest annual homelessness assessment reports that, on one night in January 2023, it calculated that around 653,000 Americans were homeless — over 12% more than the previous year. Six-in-10 were experiencing sheltered homelessness — meaning they were in an emergency shelter, transitional housing or safe haven program — while the remainder were unsheltered.
As for the health insurance figure, Sanders may have been referring to a 2022 survey from the Commonwealth Fund that found 43% of working-age adults were uninsured or inadequately insured — around 85 million people — according to PolitiFact.
To help address these issues, Sanders has long called for taxation on the ultra-wealthy, an initiative he wishes the U.S. would undertake and provide global leadership on.
It’s worth noting that Gates is actively giving away much of his fortune. Along with legendary investor Warren Buffett, he co-founded The Giving Pledge, a charitable campaign urging the world’s wealthiest individuals and families to donate more than 50% of their wealth to philanthropic causes.
Gates, however, has pledged to give away far more than that.
“I've committed to give over 95% of my money away,” he told Colbert. “To join the pledge, you only have to commit to give the majority away.”
Still, Gates enjoys the wealth he’s built.
When Colbert asked him what the best part of being a billionaire is, Gates didn’t hesitate, offering a two-fold answer.
“One is, you don't have to worry. You can send your kids to any school,” he said. “You're not going to have any problems.”
The second benefit, according to Gates, is the ability to make a real impact through philanthropy.
“If you're charitably minded, then you can pick things you believe in, malnutrition, whatever cause you want to work on, and you can be incredibly generous and help improve them,” Gates added.

212,2024-09-20 10:15:00+00:00,Microsoft Announces 10% Dividend Hike and Share Buyback: What It Means for Investors,  Eric Reed ,"Microsoft ($MSFT) investors are about to be rewarded. On September 16, the company announced that it will increase its dividend payments by 10%, from $0.75 per share to $0.83. This is consistent with the company's past practices, as it has increased dividends regularly for the past 10 years. At the same time, the company announced an upcoming $60 billion share buyback. This will likely generate a modest increase in the company's stock price.
Here's what this means for Microsoft investors. And to stay up to date on news that may impact Microsoft and other potential investments, sign up for the Market Minute newsletter.
Dividends are a form of profit sharing for corporate shareholders. When a company issues dividends, it makes a direct payment to each shareholder on a per-share basis. So, for example, in the case of Microsoft this means that the company will directly pay $0.83 to each shareholder for each share of the company's stock they own. An investor who owns 1,000 shares, then, would receive a check for $830.
A company is not legally obligated to make or continue dividend payments, although a firm can impose this requirement on itself through a corporate charter or other contract. The amount, timing and continuation of dividend payments are otherwise entirely at the company's discretion. That said, many firms make a regular practice of issuing dividends in order to encourage investment. Payment schedules are at the discretion of the company. Many companies, including Microsoft, issue their dividends on a quarterly basis.
Buybacks are when a company purchases its own stock. It can do this from the public market at large or through specific deals with institutional investors. By repurchasing its own stock, a company reduces the available share of equity available to third parties. This may allow the company to have more flexibility by mitigating risks including hostile takeovers and investor activism.
A buyback also gives the company more opportunity to generate capital through investment. By purchasing its own stock, the company now holds more of its own equity that it can later sell to investors, ideally if the company's share price has increased. (Here, it's important to remember that stock sales on the open market are almost always between investors. This secondary market does not directly generate any capital for the underlying company. A firm only generates capital when it sells its own shares directly.)
Consider speaking with a financial advisor if you need help determining evaluating the role of dividends and stock buybacks in your investment strategy.
The new dividend will be distributed quarterly starting on December 12, 2024, to shareholders registered by November 21, 2024. For investors, Microsoft's increased dividend will likely have a couple of impacts.
First, this is likely to increase the price of Microsoft stock modestly. A higher dividend makes the stock more valuable, since it means that shareholders will receive larger payments. That said, this isn't likely to have an outsized effect on the company's stock. Microsoft has issued a roughly 10% increase every year since 2013, so this past practice will already be baked into the share price to some degree.
Second, and more directly, this will mean a windfall for current and future shareholders. Anyone who owns Microsoft stock receives quarterly dividend payments. Those payments will now increase by 10%. This significantly outstrips inflation, making their shares more valuable both in terms of on-paper value and spending power. Unfortunately, since dividends are taxed as ordinary income, this will also mean higher income taxes for 2024, since the first $0.83 payments will be issued in November, 2024.

For investors, the main impact of a buyback will be a likely, modest increase in share prices.
With a stock buyback, a company makes a large purchase of its own stock. In this case, Microsoft plans to purchase up to $60 billion worth of shares, or around 1.8% of its market cap. ($60 billion / $3.2 trillion) This will in theory increase demand for the stock while also reducing the supply of shares on the market, both of which typically have the effect of increasing the stock price.
The impact of buyback programs can range. Research has historically found that a buyback will increase a company's share price by between 2% and 12% in the short term. For this reason, buybacks were historically illegal, as the SEC considered them a form of market manipulation. This rule was rolled back in the early 1980s, and today S&P 500 companies dedicate roughly half of their profits to buyback programs.
However, this average impact tends to break down into two categories. Historical research has found that value stocks, companies generally undervalued by the market, have an outsized reaction to buyback programs, sometimes posting average price increases up to 45%. For well-known companies, where undervaluation is unlikely, price impacts tend to be minor, if significantly noticeable at all.
What's more, the sustained impact on investors is often smaller than it may seem. While stock buybacks are associated with short-term price increases, as noted above those increases can range widely. More importantly, any noticeable price increase from a one-time buyback is usually transitory. As researchers have found, it typically ""dissipates completely over the subsequent month."" In order to see a sustained, significant price increase, a company may need to engage in a sustained program of repeated buybacks over a period of several years.
The upshot is that, for individual investors, Microsoft's buyback program may increase the value of their shares. However, based on historic market performance, that price increase is unlikely to be significant and will most likely be transitory unless it is part of an ongoing program of buybacks over the coming 12 to 24 months. That said, the company intends to purchase a very significant portion of its total market value, which may generate a larger-than-usual impact on the market overall. All investments involve risk. Consider speaking about your investment strategy with a financial advisor.
Microsoft has announced both increased dividends and a $60 billion share buyback. For investors, this is likely to be a windfall, although the gains will likely come primarily from the dividend payments.
Dividend investing is part of what's called ""income investing."" This is when you build a portfolio that generates regular payments just for holding the underlying assets, rather than a portfolio that requires selling your assets for capital gains. This can be an extremely effective way of building a sustainable retirement fund, although it's not without risks. Here's how to think about it. 
A financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If you're ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.
Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid — in an account that isn’t at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.

increase in share prices with a stock buyback a company makes a large purchase of its own stock in this case microsoft plans to purchase up to billion worth of shares or around of its market cap billion trillion this will in theory increase demand for the stock while also reducing the supply of shares on the market both of which typically have the effect of increasing the stock price the impact of buyback programs can range research has historically found that a buyback will increase a companys share price by between and in the short term for this reason buybacks were historically illegal as the sec considered them a form of market manipulation this rule was rolled back in the early s and today sp companies dedicate roughly half of their profits to buyback programs however this average impact tends to break down into two categories historical research has found that value stocks companies generally undervalued by the market have an outsized reaction to buyback programs sometimes posting average price increases up to for wellknown companies where undervaluation is unlikely price impacts tend to be minor if significantly noticeable at all whats more the sustained impact on investors is often smaller than it may seem while stock buybacks are associated with shortterm price increases as noted above those increases can range widely more importantly any noticeable price increase from a onetime buyback is usually transitory as researchers have found it typically dissipates completely over the subsequent month in order to see a sustained significant price increase a company may need to engage in a sustained program of repeated buybacks over a period of several years the upshot is that for individual investors microsofts buyback program may increase the value of their shares however based on historic market performance that price increase is unlikely to be significant and will most likely be transitory unless it is part of an ongoing program of buybacks over the coming to months that said the company intends to purchase a very significant portion of its total market value which may generate a largerthanusual impact on the market overall all

213,2024-09-23 18:25:00+00:00,Microsoft stock receives rare downgrade as analyst says it's 'beholden' to Nvidia, Ines Ferré    · Senior Business Reporter,"Microsoft (MSFT) received a rare Wall Street downgrade on Monday over concerns the tech giant's artificial intelligence lead is diminishing and that it has become too reliant on Nvidia (NVDA) for its AI infrastructure.
Analysts at D.A. Davidson downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy, keeping their price target unchanged at $475, which still implies around an 8% upside from current levels.
The firm noted that Microsoft's early investments and commercial product rollouts initially gave the company an advantage over Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL, GOOG), who it said were both ""caught flat-footed.""
Since then, Amazon and Google ""have invested in catching up to Microsoft, and we think you can start telling that they've caught up,"" Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, told Yahoo Finance on Monday (video above).
""Going forward, we think AWS [Amazon Web Services] and GCP [Google Cloud Platform] actually have an advantage over [Microsoft] Azure because they have the capability to deploy their own chips into their data centers, which are a fraction of the cost of an Nvidia GPU — something Microsoft has yet to do with its own chips.""
Citing their own hyperscaler semiconductor data, the analysts at D.A Davidson said Microsoft is ""beholden"" to Nvidia, its supplier of AI chips.
""Microsoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia shareholders,"" Luria said.
As Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley recently reported, Microsoft has embarked on a broad push to infuse its vast portfolio of business software products with AI capabilities as it seeks to outpace rivals in the space and monetize its enormous investments in AI technology.
The company has been plowing cash into building out its AI data centers, with its latest quarterly capital expenditures topping out at $19 billion, up 35% from the prior quarter.
Microsoft pointed to a number of bright spots in its AI business, noting that AI contributed 8 percentage points of growth to its cloud Azure revenue, up from 7 percentage points in the third quarter and 1 percentage point in the fourth quarter last year.
Despite Monday's downgrade, Microsoft shares were trading mostly flat. The stock, which topped in July, is up roughly 15% year to date.

214,2024-09-18 18:50:00+00:00,Microsoft Unveils $60 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy MSFT Stock?,  Tirthankar Chakraborty ,"One of the magnificent 7 stocks, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, is part of the $3 trillion club as its shares have seen an impressive run over the past few years. However, after hitting a record high on July 5, the MSFT stock has underperformed the S&P 500 this year (+15.9% vs. +18.1%).
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
But will Microsoft’s recent share repurchase program boost its stock price and provide an ideal entry point for potential buyers? Let’s see –
 
Microsoft recently approved a stock-buyback program, a shareholder-friendly initiative. Microsoft’s new $60 billion share repurchase program is the third largest this year after stock buyback authorizations of $100 billion and $70 billion by Apple Inc. AAPL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, respectively.
NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Meta Platforms, Inc. META had earlier approved $50 billion share repurchase programs. However, Microsoft’s new stock repurchase program matched its largest-ever buyback program (read more: NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?).
 
Microsoft’s share repurchases indicate that the company’s board of directors is hopeful about its future business scenarios.
The repurchase program is aimed at Microsoft acquiring its outstanding shares and reducing the numbers available in the open market. This, in turn, would increase the value of the remaining shares, a boon for Microsoft’s shareholders.
Microsoft is opting for a buyback to boost earnings per share (EPS) vis-à-vis the stock price. Microsoft stock, currently, is trading above the 200-day moving average (DMA), indicating a long-term uptrend.

Microsoft’s coveted Azure and cloud services business has generated a revenue growth of 29% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024. Azure’s growth strengthened Microsoft’s position in the highly competitive cloud-computing market, mostly dominated by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Microsoft has already spent $55.7 billion in fiscal 2024 on its cloud business and plans to increase its capital expenditures as Azure has picked up steam. The Azure cloud infrastructure unit is growing faster than AWS and if the trend persists, Azure could be the industry leader soon. In 2019, Azure was half the size of AWS, but now it’s three-quarters! As a result, the $13.04 Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT’s EPS is up 5% yearly.

Microsoft is generating profits competently and has used the capital optimally invested by shareholders. After all, Microsoft’s return on equity (ROE) is 36%, almost neck and neck with the Computer - Software industry’s 36.1%. Any reading above 20% is likely considered to be very strong.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Microsoft has a strong cash balance of $75.54 billion (as of June 30, 2024), which would help it pay off its dues and boost shareholders’ wealth through dividends. Microsoft recently announced a quarterly dividend of 83 cents a share to be paid on Dec. 12, 2024, up 10% from the previous quarter’s payout. Microsoft’s dividend payout has increased by almost 10.3% in the past five years, indicating a sound business model.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
 
Introducing a share repurchase plan, the possibility of Azure taking the lead from AWS, and generating a guaranteed income through dividends should allure anyone to buy MSFT shares.
However, the MSFT stock is expensive. Its price/earnings ratio is 33.3X forward earnings, while the broader S&P 500’s forward earnings multiple is 23.8X.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Hence, it’s prudent for astute investors to wait for the opportune moment to buy MSFT stock and not burn a hole in one’s pocket. For those invested in MSFT stock, hold on to it, since Microsoft is a blue-chip company having a long track record of profitability. Currently, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

215,2024-09-14 16:39:17+00:00,Is Microsoft (MSFT) the Best Blue Chip Stock To Invest In According to Short Sellers?,  Maleha Afzal ,"We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Invest In According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other blue chip stocks.
While economic data may be scarce, every data point gives a new angle to the ever-uncertain economic conditions in the US. On September 12, Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Asset Allocation, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the market moves after the consumer price index (CPI) report was released on Wednesday.
Draho suggested how regular intra-day moves did not hold enough weight to impact or influence the Fed’s decision. However, he did acknowledge that the inflation data and Wall Street’s reaction to it make the case for a 25-basis cut, or more, in the upcoming Fed meeting.
Draho then hinted that investors are hoping for a soft landing and are looking for stronger reasons or economic cues to hold back, given that bad economic news, as of now, has not triggered investors as much. He also emphasized the need for more financial data and clarity on whether the Fed would be proactive with its rate cuts for further analysis.
Contrary to what investors wish, he believes the Fed will be rather hawkish than proactive with its rate-cutting cycle. He adds that while the market calls for 100 basis points in rate cuts by the end of this year, he does expect the Fed to signal way less.
He then shed light on supply challenges in the technology sector, hinting that demand is not the issue at the moment. He was particularly impressed by the earnings posted by AI companies. Draho expects tech companies to have strong balance sheets and strong earnings power by the end of 2024, making them attractive stocks despite the economic turmoil.
On September 13, Andrew Krei, Crescent Grove Advisors co-chief investment officer, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his bullish outlook on the economy and financial markets. Krei discussed the labor market trends and how they may impact the Fed’s decisions in the upcoming meeting.
Krei pressed that despite the “unwarranted” volatility over the past few weeks, the economic outlook remains favorable, with credit markets showing close to no signs of stress. Krei also shed light on the global economic backdrop, suggesting that international markets, especially Europe, Japan, and China were showing strong signs of recovery in trade and manufacturing.
As far as investment goes, Krei suggests that while mega-cap tech stocks have shown promising results, he is more bullish on stocks outside of the magnificent 7. He was particularly inclined to companies in healthcare, finance, and industrials, hinting that these sectors will benefit immensely from the easing cycle. He then suggested that investors must shift their focus to diversified stocks with lower valuations and relatively stronger risk-adjusted returns.
Whatever the state of the economy, some stocks are notorious for their strong and consistent financial results.

Our Methodology
To come up with the 12 best blue chip stocks to invest in according to short sellers, we first went over multiple similar rankings, our own rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of blue chip stocks. We then found the companies with the lowest short float and ranked the top 12 with the largest number of hedge fund holders and lowest short float percentage. The stocks are sorted in descending order of their short interest.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279
Short % of Shares Outstanding: 0.74%
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world that develops productivity and business suite applications, cloud products, and personal computing products. It ranks third on our list of the best blue chip stocks according to short sellers.
The company’s chairman and CEO, Satya Nadella attributes Microsoft’s financial performance to its market-competitive platforms and cloud services. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported revenue worth $64.7 billion, up by 15% year-over-year. During the same quarter, Microsoft Cloud, its most popular service, logged $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 21% year-over-year, and had record bookings.
The blue-chip stock is also a leader in artificial intelligence technology. Its AI-backed cloud service, Azure OpenAI service witnessed an increase in its customer base by 60%, reaching 60,000 clients in the second quarter of 2024. Microsoft’s investments in forging strategic alliances are worth mentioning. Previously, the company partnered with Lumen Technologies and Palantir to dominate the AI space and manage workloads on its proprietary cloud service, AWS.
Overall, Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) financial strength coupled with its strategic partnerships explains why 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at the end of Q2 2024. Of those, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was the most dominant shareholder in the company.
Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
""Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years, it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.""
Overall MSFT ranks 3rd on our list of the best blue chip stocks to invest in according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

""We're doubling down on bringing more capacity to Mexico,"" Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said at an event in Mexico City.
The investment will go toward improving connectivity and boosting the adoption of AI technology by small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), the firm said in a statement.
The initiative aims to reach 5 million Mexicans and 30,000 SMBs in three years, according to the statement.
Already, Mexican firms such as breadmaker Bimbo and cement producer Cemex use Microsoft's AI tools.
Microsoft and communications company Viasat are also working to bring the internet to more than 150,000 Mexicans previously without cellular connectivity by the end of 2025, Microsoft said.
""This is great news for our country,"" incoming Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said in a post on X after meeting with Nadella, adding that the planned investment will help Mexico quickly boost its AI capabilities.

The Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 2024, held earlier this month, brought several significant updates on the technology sector for investors, particularly focusing on innovation and financial growth across growth industries. Key discussions revolved around energy-efficient computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and advanced semiconductor technologies, signaling critical transformations in tech and telecommunications. At the conference, companies working in the tech universe outlined their strategic outlooks, emphasizing the role of energy-efficient computing in driving semiconductor growth, with industries like AI, IoT, robotics, and autonomous vehicles fueling multi-trillion-dollar shifts.

One of the highlights of the conference was the appearance of NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, who appeared alongside Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon to discuss the AI industry in great detail. Quizzed about the recent US export controls on chips to China and the rise in geopolitical tensions potentially harming supplies, Huang outlined that his company was confident that if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the Taiwan-based leading supplier of advanced AI chips to NVIDIA, was compromised, the chip supply would continue, even though it would not be as good. Huang stressed that NVIDIA possessed enough intellectual property to transfer chip production from one plant to another, if need be.
NVIDIA has lost more than 15% of market capitalization since it issued third quarter guidance numbers that raised worries about slowing earnings growth. In particular, there were concerns about the concentration of hyperscalers in the NVIDIA business model, with four large customers representing nearly half of the revenue of the firm in relation to the AI boom. Following the appearance of Huang at the conference, Goldman Sachs semiconductor analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, backing the company to pick up sales in the coming months as demand for accelerated computing continued to be really strong and broadened into enterprise and sovereign states.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Washington-based technology company. The CTO of the company, Kevin Scott, spoke at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference earlier this month, remarking that it was super important for the business world to bring down the cost of compute associated with AI development. Scott underlined how one of the things that had supported all of the previous platform revolutions – personal computing, internet, smartphone, and cloud – had been the ability to move from silicon to networks to the low-level software layers that empowered the layers running on top of them to get exponentially cheaper over time. He noted that this was happening with AI, as evidenced by GPT-4 getting 12 times cheaper per token to do inference in May than at launch time.
Scott, who was an intern at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) before rising all the way to the top, noted that AI infrastructure had catalyzed a lot of similarities to big tech revolutions of the past. He detailed that because AI was a platform revolution, it was not narrow, where some company had a secret stash of infrastructure that only they had, but instead there was a huge community of people being inspired in a bunch of different ways by what the AI infrastructure was going to allow them to do. Scott said that trillion-dollar companies that are brand new were getting created due to these developments.
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd among the buzzing AI stocks to buy according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

218,2024-09-18 06:35:06+00:00,Microsoft promises ‘wave’ of 365 Copilot features but delivers a splash,  GlobalData Technology ,"At the Microsoft 365 Copilot (Copilot) ‘Wave 2’ event, the company announced several features for its generative AI (genAI) assistant that further cement Microsoft’s leadership position in the team collaboration space.
Although Microsoft is playing catch-up with some of the capabilities and generally releasing them long after they were first announced, collectively Microsoft’s portfolio makes it a vendor to beat.
The range of introductions is striking. Microsoft has touched a roster of Microsoft 365 apps including Teams, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Word, and OneDrive. With genAI touching multiple points of its portfolio, Microsoft has taken the 'permeate the platform' approach adopted by competitors such as Cisco, Google, Zoom, and RingCentral.
Although Microsoft has followed the herd in that respect, some of the features make it especially shine. Copilot agents (generally available) are a great example. The agents automate and execute business processes and range in sophistication from basic prompt-and-response agents to agents that replace repetitive tasks to agents that are fully autonomous.
Another important example is the narrative builder in PowerPoint that allows users to engage Copilot in an iterative process to quickly build a first-draft presentation triggered by an initial prompt. Similarly in Excel, data visualisation tools like charts and pivot tables can be created through an iterative partnership with Copilot; and, among other generally available capabilities, Copilot in Excel can also work with text in addition to numerical data.
Out of everything Microsoft unveiled, the most compelling is Copilot Pages, a digital canvas for creating, editing, and sharing content. Teams can collaborate and stay organised in real time. Content can be sourced from internal data and files as well as the web. And in keeping with other apps discussed immediately above such as PowerPoint and Excel, Copilot plays an iterative role in the content creation process.
While Copilot Pages stands out for its robustness and versatility, it is especially noteworthy for the flexibility and ease with which it combines information into a single environment to optimise collaboration and thereby increase productivity. Copilot Pages will be generally available for Microsoft 365 Copilot customers later in September 2024.
The event suffered flaws. Some features have already been introduced by key competitors. For example, Copilot Pages is essentially the same as ‘Zoom Docs,’ which launched in August 2024, and meeting summary and ‘catch up’ features announced for Teams have already been offered by Cisco for some time.
Also, several features were already revealed at the ‘Ignite’ event held nearly one year ago in November 2023, dramatically undercutting the thunder Microsoft had hoped for.
Those flaws do not spoil the fact that Microsoft continues to push the needle on both the team collaboration and productivity fronts simultaneously. Except for Google, only Microsoft augments its team collaboration offerings with a suite of tools aimed squarely at driving up productivity (in the form of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.).
Thus, by truly marrying team collaboration and productivity functionality, Microsoft delivers a more holistic package and achieves a degree of differentiation that is largely unmatched.

Uncertainty over the upcoming US election is another headwind that is fueling volatility in the markets. Geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, have also weighed significantly, forcing some investors to resort to defensive investment plays.

Nevertheless, the array of disappointing economic data led by weakness in the labor market has raised serious doubts about whether the US economy is overheating amid the high interest rates. With the economy creating partly 142,000 jobs and the unemployment rate at 4.25% in August, serious doubts were cast about the resilience of the US economy.
Investors need help understanding the state of the US economy, which had decelerated from the rapid expansion it experienced right after the pandemic when companies rushed to reopen and recruit new employees.
Reducing inflation has provided some relief for families struggling with rising costs. However, the job market has also slowed down, with fewer people being hired, wages increasing at a slower pace, and the duration of unemployment increasing as it becomes harder to secure employment.
A survey carried out by CNBC indicates that the probability of the US economy experiencing a soft landing stands at 53% as the US Federal Reserve starts its interest rate cut cycle. According to Michael Englund of Action Economics, the US economy is growing much faster than expected, even as it stares at economic risks on the horizon.
However, there is also a probability that the economy will plunge into recession at 36%, owing to the negative effects of the high interest rates. According to Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG US, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Power's legacy highly depends on him engineering a soft landing after keeping interest rates high for too long.

Analysts and economists share mixed opinions on whether the economy needs 25 or 50 basis points to start with to cure the effects of the high interest rate environment. The argument for beginning with a smaller cut is based on the assumption that the economy is fundamentally sound, as current and former FED officials argue.
They argue that starting with a 50-basis-point reduction could signal a deeper concern over the economy. It could prompt investors to expect quicker rate reductions, which could spark market booms that complicate efforts to combat inflation.
On the other hand, a bigger reduction might cause investors to believe wrongly that the Fed intends to lower rates by the same amount at its meetings in November and December. This could create an expectation that the Fed would move swiftly towards a neutral interest rate target, which is meant to neither stimulate nor decelerate economic growth, according to James Bullard, who served as the president of the St. Louis Fed from 2008 to 2023.
Amid the monetary policy uncertainty and economic growth slowdown concerns, the US equity market has remained resilient and supported by solid financial results. The S&P 500 rallying by double percentage points affirms growing investor sentiment.
The artificial intelligence frenzy has been one of the main catalysts driving sentiments in the equity markets. Some stocks with exposure to AI have rallied by more than 50%. On the other hand, the FED cutting interest rates is expected to provide the much-needed fuel to sustain the upward momentum in the equity markets.

220,2024-09-19 12:00:00+00:00,IBM and Microsoft Open Three New Experience Zones to Provide Global Clients with More Hands-on Access to Cloud and Generative AI Solutions,PR Newswire ,"New locations in Bucharest, Romania, Buffalo, New York, and Leicester, UK, aim to help clients explore opportunities in generative AI, hybrid cloud and other Microsoft technologies to transform their business
ARMONK, N.Y., Sept. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Microsoft announced the official opening of three new IBM-Microsoft Experience Zones within IBM's Client Innovation Centers. These Experience Zones are designed to help global clients across industries, such as financial services, government, healthcare, industrial, manufacturing and consumer packed goods (CPG), find new ways to derive value from generative AI, hybrid cloud and other Microsoft products and technologies.
In addition to the inaugural IBM-Microsoft Experience Zone in Bangalore, India, which opened in April 2024, the three new Experience Zones are strategically located in geographic locations that expand IBM's reach and ability to engage with clients to take full advantage of Microsoft's technologies to explore how to propel their business forward and innovate on potential opportunities. The new Experience Zones are located in: Bucharest, Romania; Buffalo, New York; and, Leicester, United Kingdom.
""The IBM-Microsoft Experience Zones will give clients and prospects an opportunity to explore potential solutions that leverage the strengths of both organizations,"" said Brian Wood, Research Director, Global IT Services and Systems Integration Services at IDC. ""The combined tools and platforms for data and AI show synergy in many environments and business processes.""
The IBM-Microsoft Experience Zones
Utilizing the Experience Zones, IBM's global clients will have access to Microsoft technologies including Microsoft Azure, Azure Open AI Service, Microsoft Copilot, Microsoft Dynamics and more, by using dedicated technology stations to explore and co-create generative AI solutions that span internal and external business functions. Clients can also experiment with select IBM technologies that run on Microsoft Azure, including IBM Maximo Application Suite.
""Our IBM consultants understand the challenges today's businesses face in adapting to the cloud and how AI can help them drive successful business outcomes,"" said Chris McGuire, Vice President and General Manager for the Global Microsoft Strategic Partnership at IBM. ""Before clients begin their cloud transformation journey, these Experience Zones can provide opportunities for hands-on access and ideation with IBM and Microsoft experts to identify those challenges and help clients develop technology solutions to create value and solve their most pressing business needs.""
At the Experience Zone in Bangalore, CIOs and their teams have explored solutions around cloud modernization, Microsoft Azure and custom copilots. Industry clients such as manufacturing, gas and oil, and CPG have shown an interest in capabilities with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), including solutions like Microsoft's Hololens and Azure Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge.
While onsite, IBM experts can work with clients to identify and solve their unique business challenges using cloud and generative AI solutions that can help them accelerate their business transformation and realize increased return on investment. For example, a financial services client could explore how Microsoft Copilot and its ability to create AI-based solutions could help cut down on the time to find documentation and review loan applications for approval. Or a client in the healthcare industry could assess ways to use various Microsoft Azure solutions to provide cloud computing for business-critical applications, such as cross-clinic access to patient files while also securing patient health information. In addition, the Experience Zones provide clients with an opportunity to up-level their employees' skill sets by showcasing next-generation technologies and industry-specific case studies to provide the resources to help enterprises harness generative AI to solve the complexities of competitive business environments.
""IBM's inaugural Microsoft Experience Zone has empowered customers to harness the full potential of the Microsoft Cloud, generative AI, and Copilot, to enable business transformation, and we are thrilled that IBM is launching three additional IBM-Microsoft Experience Zones,"" said Dinis Couto, GM, GSI Commercial Partners, at Microsoft. ""Our partnership with IBM to establish three new Experience Zones will enable even more customers to create groundbreaking and transformative AI-powered services and solutions.""
Microsoft as a Strategic Partner
IBM Consulting's continued investment and work with Microsoft helps our clients bring cloud and generative AI solutions to market through the expertise and guidance of IBM's dedicated practice of Microsoft practitioners globally. Today, IBM consultants have more than 46,000 Microsoft certifications and aim to add 10,000 generative AI certifications by the end of 2024. To-date, IBM consultants have successfully delivered thousands of Microsoft projects for clients, and the new Experience Zones add another opportunity for global clients to engage and discuss their business needs onsite where they can use IBM's expertise to develop and deliver innovative solutions that will enable them to transform their business so they can take full advantage of AI.
As another example of IBM's partnership with Microsoft, during the recent IBM-Microsoft Copilot Hackathon, 250 client teams and more than 800 participants worked with experts from IBM, Neudesic, Bluetab and Microsoft to explore and co-create AI-based solutions to improve productivity, unlock creativity and streamline business processes. Beyond developing solutions on Microsoft Copilot, the teams utilized IBM Consulting's Copilot Runway offering, announced in May, which allows enterprises to create and deploy customized, tailored copilots to help enhance business efficiencies that can impact the bottom line. From more than 150 submissions, the hackathon's winning prototype solutions addressed challenges including enhancing customer engagement and enablement to creating the ability to accelerate business decision-making.
With these three new Experience Zones, and client-focused engagements like the hackathon, IBM continues to highlight its commitment to – and momentum with – Microsoft as a strategic partner to deliver joint solutions for clients globally to unlock our ""better together"" philosophy and harness the full potential of generative AI and the hybrid cloud.

221,2024-09-20 13:00:15+00:00,Investors Heavily Search Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Here is What You Need to Know,  Zacks Equity Research ,"Microsoft (MSFT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +5.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 4.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $3.09 per share, indicating a change of +3.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $13.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.02 indicates a change of +15.2% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
In the case of Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate of $64.45 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14%. The $277.6 billion and $315.06 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.3% and +13.5%, respectively.
Microsoft reported revenues of $64.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.2%. EPS of $2.95 for the same period compares with $2.69 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.84%. The EPS surprise was +1.72%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Microsoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

222,2024-09-22 11:45:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy Microsoft Stock Now?,"  Collin Brantmeyer, The Motley Fool ","Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) investors have been rewarded handsomely over the past five years with an impressive total return of 225%, outpacing the market benchmark S&P 500 by approximately 120%. Any time a company as large as Microsoft surges in a relatively short period, investors are reasonable to ask how much larger the company can get.
So, let's examine the tech giant's recent financial results, capital allocation strategy, and artificial intelligence opportunity to determine whether Microsoft's stock has room to run or has reached its ceiling.
Given Microsoft's massive market capitalization of $3.2 trillion, it should come as no surprise that the company is setting records for its top and bottom lines. In its fiscal 2024, Microsoft reported $245.1 billion in revenue and $88.1 billion in net income. By contrast, in its fiscal 2023, it earned $211.9 billion in revenue and $72.4 billion in net income, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15.7% and 21.8%, respectively.
A portion of that growth was partly due to Microsoft's purchase of gaming leader Activision Blizzard for $69 billion in late 2023. However, even with that large acquisition, Microsoft's balance sheet remains healthy, with $29.3 billion in net cash.
Companies use two methods to return capital to shareholders: dividends and share repurchases. Microsoft participates in both.
Management recently announced it would raise its quarterly dividend by 10% from $0.75 to $0.83 per share. Including the new increase, Microsoft will have paid and raised its dividend for 20 consecutive years. The new dividend will represent a forward annual yield of 0.76%.
For any dividend-paying stock, investors should monitor its payout ratio, which compares the percentage of a company's earnings paid out as dividends. According to research from S&P Global, stocks with a payout ratio below 75% are considered safe and have a history of outperformance when coupled with annual raises. Microsoft's trailing-12-month payout ratio is 24.7%, so investors can reasonably expect dividend raises in the future, especially given management's consistent track record of increasing them.
Microsoft also announced that it authorized a new share repurchase program worth up to $60 billion in addition to its current program, which had $10.3 remaining as of June 30. Reducing the number of outstanding shares boosts the ownership stakes of existing shareholders and is a more tax-efficient way of returning capital than dividends. Microsoft has reduced its outstanding share count by 10% over the past decade.
Given the size of Microsoft, any significant growth may need to come from new avenues. For Microsoft, that comes in the form of artificial intelligence (AI), which the company has poured billions into recently. Microsoft invested a reported $13 billion in OpenAI, the company behind the transformative generative AI product ChatGPT. In return, Microsoft will receive ""preferential treatment when it comes to OpenAI profits,"" according to Fortune. More recently, Microsoft announced a new $30 billion fund in partnership with BlackRock to invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects.
Microsoft is also scaling its AI infrastructure with data centers and servers to meet its customers' needs across its product offerings. The company spent a quarterly high-water mark of $19 billion in capital expenditures for its fiscal year Q4 to fund its new developments, and it appears it's only the beginning. On the company's most recent earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella added, ""To meet the growing demand signal for our AI and cloud products, we will scale our infrastructure investments with FY '25 capital expenditures expected to be higher than FY '24."" For reference, Microsoft spent $55.7 billion in capital expenditures for its fiscal year 2024, which was 75% higher than its fiscal year 2023.
While Microsoft's AI bet is still in its early stages, the gamble is showing early signs of a payoff. Notably, Microsoft now has 60,000 Azure AI customers, up 60% year over year; 14,000 paid customers for its next-generation data platform, Microsoft Fabric; and 48 million monthly active users of its Power Platform, up 40% year over year.
Microsoft's stock is trading at 37.2 times earnings, higher than its five-year median price-to-earnings ratio of 33.7, indicating a relatively expensive valuation.
Still, given the company's position as a market leader and the possibilities regarding the AI revolution, investors should consider adding Microsoft to their portfolio. For those worried about the valuation, consider dollar-cost-averaging your position to ease concerns about Microsoft's lofty stock price in the short term.

223,2024-09-16 17:08:26+00:00,Microsoft introduces AI agents and updates to Copilot 365 apps as the war to make AI more useful intensifies,  Jeremy Kahn ,"Microsoft has entered the world of AI-powered agents with an update to its Microsoft 365 Copilot product that gives users the ability to quickly create a variety of AI assistants that can carry out tasks across both Microsoft’s own software and that of third-party vendors.
The software giant has become the second major business software vendor to take the plunge into agents after Salesforce earlier this month announced the rollout of a series of autonomous digital assistants. The Salesforce AI agents can autonomously handle tasks for businesses such as answering customer queries, nurturing sales leads, and analyzing sales and marketing data.
Many technologists, including Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates, believe the battle for AI agents represents a major shift in how people interact with computers and the internet. Gates has said whoever wins the battle for releasing the most capable AI agents may quickly eclipse other companies, since the AI agents could obviate the need for users to directly interact with sites such Amazon or Google, and may reduce the need for people to use many kinds of business productivity software, from word processors and spreadsheets to enterprise resource planning tools.
Google is known to be working on AI agents of its own, while Apple and Amazon have been trying to update their existing digital assistants, Siri and Alexa, with newer generative AI engines to give them the power to perform many more tasks than they can currently.
The Microsoft AI agents are part of a larger of update to Microsoft 365 Copilot that also includes added AI features in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and One Drive.
The update also includes a new document type for BizChat—a feature Microsoft introduced in March 2023 where different kinds of customer data types can live, allowing Copilot to draw on them when generating responses. The new document is called Pages and it is a kind of collaborative work surface for both human coworkers and AI digital assistants to share. Microsoft is calling it “the first real digital artIfact for the AI era.” But it is essentially a kind of digital corkboard onto which other kinds of files can be posted, allowing both humans and AI agents to work simultaneously across them, and making the transfer of data between the files more seamless than with Microsoft’s existing SharePoint and Teams products.
Microsoft first rolled out Copilot, as it has branded its generative AI offering in its 365 business productivity suite, in November 2023. While the product has seen widespread adoption by large companies, some chief information officers have complained that their employees have not found use cases for the AI features that justify the $30 per user per month price Microsoft charges. A few companies have even decided to ditch Copilot or have restricted how widely it is available within their organization.
Jared Spataro, Microsoft corporate vice president for AI@Work, told Fortune that Microsoft has taken on board such feedback, engaging with more than 1,000 customers and rolling out more than 700 updates to its Copilot product since it launched.
He said that the most popular Copilot feature has been the ability of the AI software to automatically summarize Teams meetings. He said Microsoft realized it needed to find AI features that would produce a similar “spark” with customers across the other 365 apps—“that thing that, now you’ve seen this and worked with it, you don’t want to work without it,” he said. Spataro said Microsoft believed it had now found such “sparks” for Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook and was rolling those out in this latest Copilot update.
The main feature enhancement for Excel is the ability for generative AI to automatically compose code in Python directly in Excel and use that to automatically run sophisticated data analysis tasks, including forecasting and data visualization, for users.
In PowerPoint, Microsoft is launching a feature called “Narrative Builder” that will let users have a back-and-forth conversation with a generative AI design tool and iteratively edit and improve the PowerPoint deck. While the previous version of 365 Copilot included a generative AI feature that could build a deck from a prompt, users found it did not offer the ability to then easily continue to refine the deck through a dialogue with the AI chatbot.
For Outlook, Microsoft is unveiling an AI feature called “Prioritize My Inbox” that Microsoft says will provide personalized, and sophisticated, prioritization of emails.
The new genAI features for the 365 apps will be included in the current price of Copilot. But Spataro said Microsoft was still working out how the AI agent capabilities will be priced.
Microsoft also reiterated that even users of its free Copilot chatbot enjoyed data privacy protections, meaning that documents or conversations with the chatbot are not used for training future AI systems and even queries that Copilot sends to Microsoft’s Bing search engine are anonymized so they can’t be linked back to the user.
Jamie Teevan, Microsoft’s chief scientist, said she was excited to research how people could best work with new generative AI tools, particularly agents. She said Microsoft was investigating three essential aspects of working with AI agents. The first is intent expression, which has to do with how users can be sure to convey their intentions to the agent so that the agent correctly completes specific tasks without doing things the user doesn’t want the agent to do.
She said Microsoft was still working to figure out things such as when and how the agent should ask the user clarifying questions to better understand their intent and how and when the agent should interrupt users to offer suggestions. Microsoft is keen to avoid repeating the experience many users had with Clippy, a much-derided early AI assistant it rolled out in Microsoft Word (“I see you are writing a business letter!”) whose interjections users often found intrusive and unhelpful.
The other two areas Microsoft researchers are keen to figure out as it rolls out agents is around persistence (what should the agent remember about the user or the project, and how much of this should it retain even across projects) and collaboration.
Teevan said that Microsoft has realized that many Copilot users may not be seeing the full value of the product because they don’t know the best ways to use it, so the company has begun rolling out more of what it calls “prompt support”—which are basically suggested prompts and suggestions for using Copilot to derive business value.

",2024-09,microsoft has entered the world of aipowered agents with an update to its microsoft copilot product that gives users the ability to quickly create a variety of ai assistants that can carry out tasks across both microsofts own software and that of thirdparty vendors the software giant has become the second major business software vendor to take the plunge into agents after salesforce earlier this month announced the rollout of a series of autonomous digital assistants the salesforce ai agents can autonomously handle tasks for businesses such as answering customer queries nurturing sales leads and analyzing sales and marketing data many technologists including microsoft founder and chairman bill gates believe the battle for ai agents represents a major shift in how people interact with computers and the internet gates has said whoever wins the battle for releasing the most capable ai agents may quickly eclipse other companies since the ai agents could obviate the need for users to directly interact with sites such amazon or google and may reduce the need for people to use many kinds of business productivity software from word processors and spreadsheets to enterprise resource planning tools google is known to be working on ai agents of its own while apple and amazon have been trying to update their existing digital assistants siri and alexa with newer generative ai engines to give them the power to perform many more tasks than they can currently the microsoft ai agents are part of a larger of update to microsoft copilot that also includes added ai features in word excel powerpoint outlook teams and one drive the update also includes a new document type for bizchata feature microsoft introduced in march where different kinds of customer data types can live allowing copilot to draw on them when generating responses the new document is called pages and it is a kind of collaborative work surface for both human coworkers and ai digital assistants to share microsoft is calling it the first real digital artifact for the ai era but it is essentially a kind of digital corkboard onto which other kinds of files can be posted allowing both humans and ai agents to work simultaneously across them and making the transfer of data between the files more seamless than with microsofts existing sharepoint and teams products microsoft first rolled out copilot as it has branded its generative ai offering in its business productivity suite in november while the product has seen widespread adoption by large companies some chief information officers have complained that their employees have not found use cases for the ai features that justify the per user per month price microsoft charges a few companies have even decided to ditch copilot or have restricted how widely it is available within their organization jared spataro microsoft corporate vice president for ai told fortune that microsoft has taken on board such feedback engaging with more than customers and rolling out more than updates to its copilot product since it launched he said that the most popular copilot feature has been the ability of the ai software to automatically summarize teams meetings he said microsoft realized it needed to find ai features that would produce a similar spark with customers across the other appsthat thing that now youve seen this and worked with it you dont want to work without it he said spataro said microsoft believed it had now found such sparks for excel powerpoint and outlook and was rolling those out in this latest copilot update the main feature enhancement for excel is the ability for generative ai to automatically compose code in python directly in excel and use that to automatically run sophisticated data analysis tasks including forecasting and data visualization for users in powerpoint microsoft is launching a feature called narrative builder that will let users have a backandforth conversation with a generative ai design tool and iteratively edit and improve the powerpoint deck while the previous version of copilot included a generative ai feature that could build a deck from a prompt users found it did not offer the ability to then easily continue to refine the deck through a dialogue with the ai chatbot for outlook microsoft is unveiling an ai feature called prioritize my inbox that microsoft says will provide personalized and sophisticated prioritization of emails the new genai features for the apps will be included in the current price of copilot but spataro said microsoft was still working out how the ai agent capabilities will be priced microsoft also reiterated that even users of its free copilot chatbot enjoyed data privacy protections meaning that documents or conversations with the chatbot are not used for training future ai systems and even queries that copilot sends to microsofts bing search engine are anonymized so they cant be linked back to the user jamie teevan microsofts chief scientist said she was excited to research how people could best work with new generative ai tools particularly agents she said microsoft was investigating three essential aspects of working with ai agents the first is intent expression which has to do with how users can be sure to convey their intentions to the agent so that the agent correctly completes specific tasks without doing things the user doesnt want the agent to do she said microsoft was still working to figure out things such as when and how the agent should ask the user clarifying questions to better understand their intent and how and when the agent should interrupt users to offer suggestions microsoft is keen to avoid repeating the experience many users had with clippy a muchderided early ai assistant it rolled out in microsoft word i see you are writing a business letter whose interjections users often found intrusive and unhelpful the other two areas microsoft researchers are keen to figure out as it rolls out agents is around persistence what should the agent remember about the user or the project and how much of this should it retain even across projects and collaboration teevan said that microsoft has realized that many copilot users may not be seeing the full value of the product because they dont know the best ways to use it so the company has begun rolling out more of what it calls prompt supportwhich are basically suggested prompts and suggestions for using copilot to derive business value update sept this story has been updated to

224,2024-10-11 13:00:46+00:00,Brad Gerstner on Amazon (AMZN): CEO Andy Jassy is in ‘Animal Mode’ Amid Threats from Microsoft (MSFT),  Fahad Saleem ,"We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.
Venu Krishna, Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that he is not revising his S&P 500 year-end projection of 5,600 because he believes stock valuations are “full.”
“If you see what’s happening, numbers (earnings)  have been cut sharply going into the end. What is still anchoring the market is big tech, even though their earnings themselves are kind of decelerating. Then seasonality comes into play. October is the weakest month, and you don’t want to get ahead of that.”
Asked whether he does not believe the market really broadened out, Krishna said while there were some signs of market broadening, the “anchor” of the rally remains big tech, which according to him, are just six stocks.
Moving beyond the earnings and valuations debate, another factor still impacting investor sentiment is the Federal Reserve’s next moves.
Talking about the latest Fed minutes released October 9,  Wolfe Research’s Stephanie Roth said on CNBC that a “substantial” majority of Fed officials wanted a 50-basis-point rate cut. However, she said in the next meeting, a 50bps rate cut is “off the table.”
For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news. With each stock we mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 308
Talking to CNBC, Brad Gerstner explained why he is invested in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
“Because we think their retail business their margins are gonna go up. Jassy has absolutely found religion. He’s in animal mode when it comes to making sure they are running as efficiency as possible.”
However, the investor said there is “a lot of worry” when it comes to AWS amid concerns that the company might be at risk of losing market share to Azure. Brad Gerstner said Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) “has to invest” in Anthropic because MSFT currently has an edge because of its OpenAI investments.
AWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.
Like other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.
Based on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.
Meridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.”
Overall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. While we acknowledge the potential Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

227,2024-09-12 10:22:16+00:00,Microsoft to Cut 650 Jobs in Latest Round of Xbox Unit Layoffs,  Dina Bass and Vlad Savov ,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. said it is cutting 650 jobs in its Xbox unit, the third such layoffs this year as the company tries to rein in costs and integrate its massive $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc.

The roles to be eliminated are in “mostly corporate and supporting functions,” according to a memo sent to staff by Xbox chief Phil Spencer on Thursday. “No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.”
Xbox employees had been bracing for further reductions after Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs, many from Activision units and studios, in January. In May, the company announced the shuttering of four studios acquired as part of its $7.5 billion purchase of ZeniMax — one of which was ultimately sold instead. These steps, along with the decision to release some Xbox games on rival consoles, have angered some of the platform’s fans and left them questioning Microsoft’s commitment to building compelling exclusive content.
It has been a brutal year for the games industry more broadly, as it reckons with rising game development costs and tepid growth. Sony Group Corp., Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. and Electronic Arts Inc. are among the major global companies that have cut jobs and shut down marquee projects. Sony this month axed big-budget multiplayer shooter Concord only two weeks after its release, showing little patience for a game that got off to a slow start.
Microsoft completed the Activision acquisition in October, 21 months after it was announced and following a bruising battle to obtain antitrust clearance. The purchase has given Xbox an infusion of new content and talent, but also a challenge in making the deal pay off over the long run.
Changes to Microsoft Gaming
For the past year, our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work. As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming—mostly corporate and supporting functions—to organize our business for long term success.
I know that this is difficult news to hear. We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues who are learning they are impacted. In the US, we’re supporting them with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition; outside the US packages will differ according to location.
With these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs. Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games. No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.
Throughout our team’s history, we have had great moments, and we have had challenging ones. Today is one of the challenging days. I know that going through more changes like this is hard, but even in the most trying times, this team has been able to come together and show one another care and kindness as we work to continue delivering for our players. We appreciate your support as we navigate these changes and we thank you for your compassion and respect for each other.

228,2024-09-07 09:43:17+00:00,Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) The Safest Stock To Invest In Now?,  Maleha Afzal ,"We recently compiled a list titled Starter Stock Portfolio: 10 Safe Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other safe stocks to invest in.
A probable rate cut has provided hope for the economy. Despite that, the impact on financial markets and stocks remains uncertain. On September 4, Adam Parker, Trivariate Research founder and CEO, appeared in an interview on CNBC. Parker was not surprised that tech stocks were down by close to 4% at the beginning of September, that too right before an impending rate cut. Parker highlights that the inconsistency in the market at the moment is not normal, and with multiple rate cuts over the next two years, he has no reason to hold a positive economic outlook. He suggests that eight probable rate cuts indicate that the economy is slowing, consumer spending is declining, and unemployment is rising, all of which are not good signs for the market. The interviewer counter questions that eight rate cuts with a 25 basis point reduction are not as disastrous to presume a faltering economy. Parker then highlights that rate cuts in the past have been supported by consistent data, an incremental fiscal, and an expansion of the balance sheet, all of which are currently out of the picture. You can also read our piece on the best battery stocks to buy according to short sellers.
On September 2, CNBC published a detailed report on the impact of rate cuts on the stock market in the United States. The Fed, in the footsteps of countries in Europe and Asia, recently announced an easing cycle, after a long period of high interest rates. As per current pricing data, the Fed is expected to have three 25-basis point cuts by the end of this year. Speaking of the global economic outlook, 2025 will see a lower-rate environment followed by easing inflationary pressures. However, the fear of recession in the United States tells another story. Analysts believe that the last four months of 2024 will be considerably weak and choppy amid geopolitical factors, uncertainty from the AI sector, corporate earnings, and most importantly, an overdue consolidation correction.
On September 3, JP Morgan reported that investors must not expect the cutting cycle to provide a fresh start to stocks. Leading strategists at the firm suggested that the rate cut cycle is rather reactive and is in response to a wilting economy, having little to no impact on stocks. Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy, on the other hand, suggested that the market environment today resembles the market in 1995, increasing hopes for a market upside amid stable GDP strength and forecasts.
Bear market or bull market, certain stocks deserve a place in every investor’s portfolio. These are long-term opportunities to hold and will continue to provide superior returns, as they have for decades.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world that develops productivity and business suite applications, cloud products, and personal computing products.
The company’s chairman and CEO, Satya Nadella believes that Microsoft’s financial performance is attributable to its market-competitive platforms and cloud services. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported revenue worth $64.7 billion in FQ4 2024, up by 15% year-over-year. During the same quarter, Microsoft Cloud had $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 21% year-over-year, and posted record bookings. Its productivity/business processes and intelligent cloud segment, on the other hand, logged revenue worth $20.3 billion and $28.5 billion in revenue, respectively.
The company is a leading investor in artificial intelligence technology. Its AI-backed cloud service, Azure OpenAI service witnessed an increase in customer base by 60%, reaching 60,000 clients in the second quarter of 2024. Previously in July, Microsoft and Lumen Technologies signed a partnership to enhance and modernize Lumen’s workloads to Microsoft Azure. Earlier in August, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnered with Palantir Technologies, a data software company, to deploy Palantir’s suite of products in Microsoft Azure.
Overall, Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) financial strength coupled with its strategic partnerships make it one of the safest stocks to invest in. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and their stakes amounted to $89.068 billion. As of June 30, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the most dominant shareholder in the company and has a position worth $15.6 billion.
Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.”
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd among the safe stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

229,2024-08-28 09:02:01+00:00,Microsoft's AI software is gaining traction with enterprise customers, Daniel Howley    · Technology Editor,"Microsoft (MSFT) says more of its customers are signing up for and using its generative AI-based Copilot software, a sign that its AI investments are beginning to pay off.
The tech giant is pouring billions of dollars into its AI efforts as it seeks to spread the technology across its Azure-based cloud offerings, suite of productivity products, and Windows operating system.
And according to Jared Spataro, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of AI at work, the company is seeing sizable gains in usage of its Copilot for Microsoft 365.
“Last quarter, the number of Copilot for [Microsoft 365] customers increased by more than 60%, which is great because we were already off to the races with that,” Spataro told Yahoo Finance.
“Daily users more than doubled, and we love that trend. When we start to see that type of intensity of usage doubling, it means that you're really onto something,” added Spataro.
During its most recent earnings report, Microsoft announced Intelligent Cloud segment revenue, which includes its Azure services, of $28.5 billion. That was just short of Wall Street’s expectation of $28.7 billion. And while that was a 19% year-over-year revenue increase, investors reacted negatively to the news, sending shares lower following the earnings announcement.
Though Microsoft’s stock price has rebounded, it’s still up roughly 1.5% over the last six months, compared to rival Google's stock (GOOG, GOOGL), which is up more than 20%.
Microsoft’s near miss shows how fine a line hyperscalers and software vendors must tread between investing in AI and showing that those investments are paying off.
According to Spataro, the number of 10,000-seat subscriptions for Copilot for Microsoft 365 has doubled with big-name organizations including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, and Novartis. Microsoft, however, didn’t provide exact information on daily or monthly active user numbers or how many Copilot for Microsoft 365 licenses it’s sold.
The key to Copilot’s success is proving that it saves enterprise users time on tasks, whether that’s reducing the length of meetings, cutting down on how long it takes to sort through emails, or helping to brainstorm ideas.
So far, Microsoft says its customers are seeing results. Networking and cybersecurity company Lumen’s employees are saving four hours per week in work using Copilot, which should result in a $50 million annual savings. Cognizant, for its part, says it’s seen a 10% reduction in time spent on emails and a 27% increase in employees ending meetings early, Spataro explained.
It’s not all good news for Microsoft, however. In February, the Wall Street Journal reported on customer reactions to Copilot, with some users complaining about the software’s tendency to make mistakes in scheduling or summarizing meetings.
According to a Morgan Stanley research note seen by Business Insider, an executive at a pharmaceutical company that was using Copilot canceled an upgrade it ordered for the software, saying the price didn’t match the value they were getting out of it.
Spataro, however, says Microsoft has performed its own six-month study of 60 companies and found that those firms saw a 50% decrease in email usage thanks to Copilot. Microsoft also says it performed a survey of 1,300 Copilot users and found that it typically takes companies 11 weeks and they need to see a time savings of at least 11 minutes per day for their Copilot habits to stick for the long term.
“This is a moment of kind of reprogramming how work gets done,” Spataro said. “It is not just an incremental change.”
In a separate Morgan Stanley research note, analysts found that 94% of chief information officers surveyed said they expect to use Microsoft’s generative AI services over the next 12 months. That’s up from just 47% in the second quarter of 2023.
Microsoft isn’t alone in its race to bring generative AI-powered software to its enterprise customers. Google is also offering its Gemini for Workspace to customers, while Salesforce is pushing its own generative AI software as well.
Microsoft is also in the midst of rolling out Copilot-based updates for its Windows operating system, including its Recall feature, which was initially pulled from release due to security concerns.
Microsoft will need to continue building out its base of Copilot users as it works to take market share in the space and ensure it holds onto its leadership position in enterprise software. That said, the generative AI revolution is still in its early stages, and Microsoft’s rivals are circling.
And with investors paying close attention to Microsoft’s AI moves, it will need to consistently deliver on its AI goals if it’s going to succeed in this new era of computing.
Correction: The number of 10,000-seat subscriptions for Copilot for Microsoft 365 has doubled. The article originally said 1,000 seats.

230,2024-09-08 08:04:09+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Assessing Its Strength Among the Best ESG Stocks to Buy Now,  Sheryar Siddiq ,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other ESG stocks.
Defining ESG can sometimes be straightforward: it’s a finance and investing approach centered on managing risks related to environmental factors, social issues, and corporate governance. Although the concept emerged about two decades ago through a collaboration between United Nations officials and the finance industry, who argued that addressing ESG risks like climate change, labor disputes, and poor corporate governance can safeguard investments, it wasn’t until the late 2010s and into the 2020s that ESG evolved into a more proactive movement, rather than a reactive one.
A report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, with the global average near-surface temperature reaching 1.45°C—closer than ever to the 1.5°C lower limit set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. Another report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also reveals that climate-driven disasters are already surpassing scientists’ initial predictions. This urgency has sparked increased interest in niche yet rapidly expanding sectors of ESG investing, such as climate-transition funds and catastrophe bonds. In 2024, global investment in clean energy is expected to hit a significant milestone, doubling the amount allocated to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) 2024 World Energy Investment report forecasts that total global energy investment will surpass $3 trillion this year, with $2 trillion directed toward clean technologies like renewables, electric vehicles, and nuclear power. Furthermore, Bloomberg reports that global investment in the energy transition surged by 17% last year, reaching a record $1.8 trillion, with this growth trend continuing. Former VettaFi financial futurist Dave Nadig said:
“If you solely look at climate as your window, you’ll probably not end up not owning a lot of energy companies, not owning a lot of miners [and] not owning a lot of steel companies. So, you end up with something that looks like services, healthcare, and technology, which is a very strong bet to take.”
That said, U.S. funds with ESG goals seem to be losing popularity as of late. Despite the broader stock market’s gains, assets in the sector have dropped to around $335 billion, down from a peak near $365 billion at the end of 2021. Political criticism of ESG in the country has also has led some investors to reconsider their strategies within the sector. Moreover, ESG stocks are also grappling with other significant challenges, such as a key climate regulation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that is currently under legal dispute, and the Federal Reserve’s resistance to including environmental risks in global financial regulations.
However, despite criticism labeling the ESG sector as “woke” investing, many U.S. firms remain dedicated to ESG initiatives. Investor interest also remains somewhat robust, as these funds continue to attract attention for considering both financial performance and environmental, social, and governance factors. While there have been big outflows from the sector, many institutional investors are approaching climate risks and opportunities in their portfolios with a heightened sense of urgency, with an August analysis published in the Harvard Business Review showing that nearly three-quarters of the corporate climate commitments announced in 2021 had been fully or partially achieved. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are among the top global underwriters of green bonds this year, while Bank of America, alongside other prominent investment banking firms, recently sponsored ESG-focused conferences in New York and Chicago.
With that in mind, ESG funds saw strong performance in the first half of the year, largely driven by their substantial investments in technology stocks. Most ESG funds that aren’t focused on renewable energy tend to allocate more to tech stocks while maintaining a lower exposure to oil and gas stocks. In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 rose by approximately 15%, and nearly 60% of this gain was driven by the majority of the ‘Magnificent Seven’, which are often among the largest holdings in ESG funds.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands out as a leading ESG stock, much in part due to its strategic investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, which has strengthened its position across hardware, software, and global cloud services. The company is committed to sourcing 100% renewable energy by 2025, becoming carbon negative by 2030, and offsetting all historical carbon emissions since its founding in 1975 by 2050.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently dipped after the company’s latest quarterly results revealed slower-than-expected growth in its Cloud business. For the current quarter, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) projects revenue between $63.8 billion and $64.8 billion, slightly below the $65.07 billion estimate, with Azure revenue anticipated to grow by 28% to 29% year over year. Additionally, the company’s Office commercial customer sales surged to $48 billion, marking a significant increase from last year’s 10% growth, likely fueled by the adoption of Copilot Pro subscriptions.
BMO Capital Markets maintained its positive outlook on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), keeping an Outperform rating and a $500 price target. The firm emphasized Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s strong position in artificial intelligence and its diverse product portfolio as key reasons for its top pick status. Although BMO acknowledged a less-than-stellar June quarter report and guidance for about 29% year-over-year growth in Azure for the September quarter, Microsoft’s management projected an acceleration in Azure growth in the second half of fiscal 2025 during the last earnings call. BMO’s analysis suggests that while Azure’s growth has been limited by capacity constraints in recent quarters, these challenges are expected to ease in the latter half of FY25, supported by a strong demand pipeline.
Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“The top absolute contributors were Alphabet, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon. Microsoft was another top absolute contributor in the quarter, speaking to a growing appreciation for all the ways the company has an opportunity to monetize GenAI, be it in its Office suite or Azure cloud business. In the latter case, it contributed 7% to Azure’s revenue growth in the most recent quarter. We believe Microsoft remains a highly advantaged business with many secular tailwinds driving durable growth for the foreseeable future, even at its immense scale.”
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the best ESG stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

231,2024-09-05 22:05:46+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News,  Usman Kabir ,"We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other trending AI stocks.
Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have taken a beating over the past few days, merely weeks after a broader market selloff in the technology sector that shook the entire finance industry.  Shares of several prominent AI companies like have all witnessed high single digit drops in the space of just 24 hours. The NVIDIA selloff has wiped nearly $300 billion off the market value of the company. The growth-heavy NASDAQ Composite has registered a more than 3% drop in a single day of trading. AI valuations are bloated, no doubt, and the recent bear market has erased nearly $1 trillion in value from AI firms in just a few hours.

The concerns around top AI chipmaker stem from recent reports that authorities in the US are growing uneasy about the near monopoly of the firm in terms of GPU provision. The stock's outperformance in this regard has delighted investors - the chipmaker is doing business with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta - but it has invited the ire of the Justice Department. The department is speculated to be in the process of sending a subpoena to the company, binding the business to provide certain information, in relation to an antitrust case. The purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli firm specializing in GPU orchestration software, back in April is believed to be one of the bones of contention between the AI chipmaker and the government.
Macro developments are also weighing on the AI stocks in the near term. Commodity markets around the world are absorbing less than impressive growth numbers from China, impacting prices of copper and rare earths. Copper and rare earth metals are extensively used in AI devices, from chips to batteries. Lates US manufacturing data also paints a not so good picture for factories. According to authorities, US manufacturing witnessed a further decline in new orders and rise in inventory during August, even as manufacturing overall contracted at a modest pace. In addition to these factors, new investment notes on AI from JPMorgan and BlackRock, questioning the ROI on ballooning AI capex, have also grabbed media headlines.

Latest reports suggest that Sam Altman, the CEO of the startup, has been lobbying the US government over a plan to build the AI infrastructure needed for supporting AI-based machines and systems across the world. This plan includes tens of billions in spending to set up data centers, grow energy capacity and transmission with renewables, and expand semiconductor manufacturing.

233,2024-09-04 14:55:00+00:00,Can AI Advancements Drive Microsoft's Stock Beyond its 8.8% YTD Gain?,  Vasundhara Sawalka ,"Though Microsoft MSFT has been making significant strides in artificial intelligence (AI), its stock has lagged behind the broader market. With an 8.8% year-to-date (YTD) gain, Microsoft has underperformed both the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500 index’s return of 20.7% and 18.4%, respectively. This raises a crucial question of whether Microsoft's AI advancements will provide the needed boost to its stock performance.Microsoft has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, making significant investments in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and integrating AI capabilities across its product suite. This strategic move has positioned Microsoft as a leader in the AI space, potentially opening up new revenue streams and enhancing existing ones. Despite these moves, investors seem to be taking a cautious stance, perhaps waiting for concrete evidence of how these AI initiatives will translate into revenue growth and profitability.

Microsoft is rapidly integrating AI across its product lineup, from search engines to cloud computing, leveraging AI to enhance its offerings and challenge competitors in various markets.One of Microsoft's boldest moves is the integration of ChatGPT-like capabilities into Bing, directly challenging Google's search dominance. This initiative, coupled with the expansion of Azure AI, Microsoft's cloud-based AI platform, demonstrates the company's commitment to AI-driven growth. Azure AI has seen remarkable adoption, with its customer base growing nearly 60% year over year to more than 60,000 clients. For fiscal first-quarter 2025, Microsoft projects Intelligent Cloud revenues between $28.6 billion and $28.9 billion, with Azure expected to achieve 28-29% revenue growth at constant currency.The company's productivity suite, Microsoft 365, is also benefiting from AI integration. Features like AI-powered writing assistance in Word and smart data analysis in Excel are enhancing user productivity, potentially leading to higher adoption rates and increased customer retention. These improvements could significantly impact Microsoft's recurring revenue streams.Microsoft's Copilot, an AI-powered productivity tool, is making waves across various sectors. GitHub Copilot, adopted by over 77,000 organizations, including BBVA and FedEx, has seen 180% year-over-year growth, driving GitHub's revenues to a $2 billion annual run rate. The launch of Copilot+ PCs, featuring new system architecture and advanced silicon technology, promises to deliver breakthrough AI experiences and enhanced productivity. Recently, Microsoft expanded the Copilot+ PC portfolio with the introduction of a new silicon technology — AMD Ryzen AI 300 series and Intel Core Ultra 200V series.The integration of generative AI into Microsoft's Power Platform has enabled over 480,000 organizations to leverage AI capabilities, with monthly active users growing 40% year over year to 48 million. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is rapidly becoming indispensable for knowledge workers, with its daily users nearly doubling quarter over quarter.As Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI, the challenge lies in translating these technological advancements into tangible financial results. Success will be measured by increased market share in search, accelerated growth in cloud services and improved adoption rates for productivity tools. Investors and industry watchers will be closely monitoring Microsoft's ability to leverage its AI capabilities into market-beating performance as the AI landscape evolves.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT’s fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $277.39 billion, indicating 13.2% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $13.04, indicating 10.5% growth year over year.

Microsoft's recent stock underperformance, despite its AI initiatives, highlights the complex factors influencing tech sector valuations. While the company pushes forward with AI integration across its product line, broader market concerns and macroeconomic uncertainties continue to impact investor sentiment.The AI landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with tech giants like Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google, Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META making significant investments. Microsoft's success will hinge on its ability to maintain a competitive edge and effectively monetize its AI technologies. Additionally, looming regulatory scrutiny adds an element of uncertainty to AI-driven growth prospects across the industry.Microsoft's current valuation presents a premium scenario, with its forward 12-month P/S ratio of 10.71X exceeding both the Zacks Computer - Software industry average of 7.98X and its own historical median of 10.1X. This elevated pricing reflects strong investor confidence in Microsoft's future growth, particularly in cloud computing and AI. However, it also raises questions about potential limitations and whether the company's performance can justify this premium in the long term.As Microsoft navigates these challenges, investors will be closely watching its ability to translate AI innovations into tangible financial results and market outperformance.

While Microsoft's 8.8% YTD gain appears modest compared to the broader market and industry performance, the company's aggressive moves in AI present a potential catalyst for future growth. The successful integration and monetization of AI across its product lines could open up new revenue streams, enhance Microsoft's competitive position and drive the stock further. However, investors should also be mindful of the challenges, including intense competition and potential regulatory hurdles. Maintaining a position in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock appears prudent at present. New investors should, however, wait for a better entry point for Microsoft. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

235,2024-08-06 18:38:13+00:00,Microsoft lashes out at Delta: Your ancient tech caused the service meltdown,"  Ramishah Maruf, CNN ","Microsoft on Tuesday blamed Delta Air Lines for its weeklong bout of cancelations last month, claiming its aging technology caused the airline to recover far slower from the global tech outage than its rivals. Microsoft also claimed Delta turned down help after the CrowdStrike bug led to “blue screens of death” on Windows devices.
Microsoft, CrowdStrike and Delta have been in a war of words since the airline hired a high-profile attorney to seek compensation from Microsoft and CrowdStrike.
Delta CEO Ed Bastian lashed out at CrowdStrike in a CNBC interview last week and said the computer problems cost Delta $500 million. CrowdStrike’s flawed software update caused widespread computer outages on July 19 at Delta and hundreds of other companies around the globe.
CrowdStrike then fired back on Sunday, saying the airline had refused offers of help to get through the outage faster.
On Tuesday, Microsoft joined in. In a letter by attorney Mark Cheffo, the tech company said that even though Microsoft’s software did not cause the outage, it “immediately jumped in and offered to assist Delta at no charge.” Microsoft employees asked Delta if they needed assistance every day from July 19 to 23, the letter said.
“On the morning of July 22, a Microsoft employee, aware that Delta was having more difficulty recovering than any other airline, messaged a Delta employee to say, ‘just checking in and no pressure to reply, but if you can think of anything your Microsoft team can be helping with today, just say the word.’”
The letter continued. “The Delta employee replied, saying ‘all good. Cool will let you know and thank you.’”
But meanwhile, the computer problems at Delta knocked its crucial crew tracking system offline for the better part of a week, making it impossible for the company to find the pilots and flight attendants it needed to fly its aircraft. While other airlines were quick to resume normal operations after the CrowdStrike outage, Delta was forced to cancel about 30% of its schedule over those five days, leaving an estimated half-million passengers stranded. It took many days after that to re-book affected passengers on other flights and return their checked bags.
On July 24, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella emailed Bastian as well, according to the letter.
“In fact, it is rapidly becoming apparent that Delta likely refused Microsoft’s help because the IT system it was most having trouble restoring—its crew-tracking and scheduling system—was being serviced by other technology providers, such as IBM, because it runs on those providers’ systems, and not Microsoft Windows or Azure,” the letter said.
Microsoft said a preliminary review suggested Delta hasn’t “modernized its IT infrastructure” though its competitors have.
“Delta has a long track record of investing in safe, reliable and elevated service for our customers and employees. Since 2016, Delta has invested billions of dollars in IT capital expenditures, in addition to the billions spent annually in IT operating costs,” a Delta spokesperson said.
Last week, Bastian claimed CrowdStrike was nowhere to be found during the meltdown.
“They haven’t offered us anything. Free consulting advice to help us,” said the Delta CEO in an interview on CNBC.
“If you’re going to have priority access to the Delta ecosystem in terms of technology, you’ve got to test this stuff,” Bastian said. “You can’t come into a mission critical 24/7 operation and tell us we have a bug. It doesn’t work.”
A person familiar with its actions confirmed to CNN that Delta had hired the law firm of high-profile attorney David Boies to pursue compensation from Microsoft and CrowdStrike.
“We have no choice,” Bastian told CNBC. “We have to protect our shareholders, we have to protect our customers (and) our employees for the damage, not just the cost but the reputational damage.”
On Monday, CrowdStrike’s legal counsel sent a letter to Delta’s legal counsel, saying it was “highly disappointed by Delta’s suggestion that CrowdStrike acted inappropriately and strongly rejects any allegation that it was grossly negligent or committed willful misconduct.”
Like Microsoft, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz offered onsite assistance personally to Delta CEO Ed Bastian but received no response, the letter said, adding that Delta later told CrowdStrike no help was needed.
Delta’s public litigation threat “contributed to a misleading narrative that CrowdStrike is responsible for Delta’s IT decisions and response to the outage,” attorney Michael Carlinsky wrote in the letter, “Should Delta pursue this path, Delta will have to explain to the public, its shareholders, and ultimately a jury why CrowdStrike took responsibility for its actions—swiftly, transparently, and constructively—while Delta did not.”
The letter also said Delta would have to explain “resiliency capabilities of Delta’s IT infrastructure.”
Delta has not yet filed a lawsuit against Microsoft or CrowdStrike.
In a statement, a CrowdStrike spokesperson said the letter speaks for itself.
“We have expressed our regret and apologies to all of our customers for this incident and the disruption that resulted. Public posturing about potentially bringing a meritless lawsuit against CrowdStrike as a long-time partner is not constructive to any party. We hope that Delta will agree to work cooperatively to find a resolution,” a CrowdStrike spokesperson said.

236,2024-08-15 14:00:02+00:00,Microsoft: Navigating AI Investments Amid Market Volatility,  Sheraden Frances ,"Despite being seen as a key beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, primarily due to its strategic investment in OpenAI, Microsoft Corp.'s (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has underperformed broader markets and its mega-cap peers this year. After a strong start, the stock has only gained about 7.10% year to date. This is a significant decline from its mid-July peak, where it was up nearly 25%.
The downturn can be attributed to weaker-than-expected near-term prospects at Azure following the latest earnings release and the broader global market sell-off driven by disappointing employment data, which heightened recessionary fears.

Even with this moderate sell-off, despite strong fourth-quarter earnings, I believe there is no reason to be less bullish on Microsoft now than a few months ago. The company's core fundamentals remain robust, with all three business segments continuing to show solid growth, led by the impressive performance of the Intelligent Cloud division. Microsoft's operating leverage remains resilient, and the company continues to be a free cash flow powerhouse, even as it ramps up research and development and capital expenditures. I see a clear path to double-digit forward returns, making Microsoft a compelling long-term opportunity.
I have long held the view that Microsoft would be a frontrunner in the AI revolution, and the past year has only strengthened this belief. The company's operational momentum continues to build, reinforcing my confidence. Despite the market's overreaction to fourth-quarter 2024 earnings, I believe Microsoft still has significant growth potential. For investors who buy at current levels, this could be an excellent opportunity to secure substantial future gains. In this analysis, I will explain why I remain bullish on Microsoft and why I believe the market's response to the recent earnings report was unwarranted.
Despite the expected deceleration in Azure's growth through the first half of fiscal 2025, Microsoft has witnessed substantial growth in recent quarters. Azure Cloud Services reported a 29% revenue increase in the fourth quarter, while Microsoft Cloud recorded a 21% rise, driven by the broader adoption of AI-enhanced services across its offerings. In recent times, the performance of Microsoft's quarters has largely hinged on Azure's success, and the fourth quarter was no exception. However, it is important to note the slowdown in Azure's growth was primarily due to AI-related capacity constraintsindicating a supply issue rather than a lack of demand. Demand for Azure AI remains robust, underscoring its pivotal role in driving the company's growth.
Microsoft, a significant client of Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), is in fierce competition with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) within the cloud market. As of the first quarter of 2024, the company's share of the global cloud market grew from 22% to 25% over the prior four quarters, outpacing both Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. While AWS has long been the leader in cloud computing, the competitive landscape is shifting. Recent developments suggest Azure could potentially overtake AWS as the leading cloud service provider by 2026. The Azure OpenAI service, which enables customers to build AI applications without the need for expensive hardware, is a critical driver of this growth. As Microsoft's AI and cloud services continue to evolve, the company is well-positioned to challenge AWS's dominance in the coming years.

Microsoft's aggressive investment in AI for Azure is attracting new customers and even luring AWS and GCP users to switch. The increasing revenue and profits generated from AI demonstrate the company's strategy is moving in the right direction, albeit at a steady pace rather than explosive growth. The current supply constraints highlight the overwhelming demand, justifying Microsoft's continued investment in AI. The company has outlined plans to invest billions in data centers and AI hubs globally, including a multibillion-dollar investment in Spain. Additionally, it has partnered with Lumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN) to expand network capacity and support the rising demand on data centers.
This aggressive investment in AI infrastructure underscores management's strong conviction in capturing a share of the potential $1.30 trillion market opportunity. Microsoft's broad representation in the cloud value chain positions it well to anticipate and meet demand, making its continued investment in data center expansion a logical and necessary step.
The software giant delivered another robust quarter on July 30, surpassing revenue and earnings per share consensus estimates. The fourth quarter saw a 15.20% year-over-year increase in revenue, with adjusted earnings rising from $2.69 to $2.95 per share, driven in part by strong operating leverage. Notably, Microsoft Cloud posted 21% year-over-year growth, while Azure and Cloud Services recorded a 29% increase. Of the latter, 8% was driven by Microsoft's generative AI services, which, while contributing modestly, still reflects the significant impact of AI on Microsoft's largest growth segments. Contrary to market expectations for explosive growth, I view the current levels of growth as reasonable and on the right trajectory, likely to accelerate as Microsoft's substantial AI investments begin to pay off.

Investors were disappointed by what they perceived as a slowdown in Azure's growth, which reported a 29% year-over-year increase (30% in constant currency), falling short of both the company's forecast of 30% to 31% and analysts' expectations of over 30%. However, I find it hard to label a 29% growth rate as a ""slowdown."" The market's reaction, leading to a sell-off, seems irrational to me. Microsoft is not overbuilding; it is expanding its capacity to meet customer demand. As this capacity comes online through continued investments, I expect growth rates to pick up.
The transition to generative artificial intelligence at Microsoft is resource-intensive, with capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 reaching $45 billion and even higher expenditures for 2025, according to management forecasts. This has raised concerns about the company's profit margins moving forward. While Microsoft projects double-digit revenue and operating income growth, the increased capex will inevitably impact profitability. Investors should not expect significant margin expansion in the near term as operating margins are expected to hold steady with a slight decline of about 1%. However, in the longer term, as AI infrastructure investments stabilize and mature, I anticipate significant upward pressure on operating margins given the potential of AGI to drive widespread benefits.

Microsoft's strong free cash flow generation is a testament to its solid operating leverage. The company generated $12.40 billion in levered FCF during the quarter, despite a $5 billion year-over-year increase in capex. This robust FCF has further strengthened its balance sheet, which now boasts a $75 billion cash reserve.
This financial flexibility positions Microsoft well for significant acquisitions, as evidenced by the $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal in 2023. Capex as a percentage of total revenue has surged from the low teens to the high teens, driven by the generative AI boom since 2023. Management has indicated that capex investments will increase materially in 2025, surpassing 2024 levels. While this elevated spending might create a near-term headwind on FCF, the strong demand outlook, supported by cloud migrations and AI adoption, justifies this strategic investment.
Following the recent sell-off, Microsoft is trading at 21.50 times forward earnings, positioning it as an attractive pick among the Magnificent Seven. This valuation is slightly lower than Amazon's price-earnings ratio of 23 and Apple's ratio of 25, making Microsoft a compelling option, particularly since only Meta is trading at a cheaper valuation. I anticipate Microsoft maintaining a 25 to 30 times earnings multiple as its top-line growth moderates to the 6% to 8% range.
This outlook is underpinned by the company's strong net cash position, highly recurring revenue base and projected long-term net margins of 40% to 45%. Investors can expect returns driven by both top-line growth and earnings yield, with the added confidence that Microsoft has historically been a reliable buy during market pullbacks. Given the current market meltdown in the U.S. due to recessionary fears, now appears to be an ideal time to invest in a high-quality company at a reasonable price. Microsoft's strong financial performance across cycles further enhances its attractive return proposition.

From a discounted cash flow perspective, using a discount rate of 8.80% and a five-year exit Ebitda multiple of 21.80, aligned with peers, I derive a valuation of approximately $472 per share. This suggests an upside of 16.20% based on conservative estimates. This valuation reflects my belief that Microsoft is likely to maintain stability at current levels as management continues to execute on its AI roadmap.
Considering Microsoft's significant growth potential amid the AI boom, its integration of AI technology and continued increases in revenue and earnings, this valuation provides a substantial margin of safety. Additionally, the company's potential to expand and enhance revenue streams in emerging and developing markets is strong. The company is well-positioned to gain market share from AWS and GCP, particularly with its ongoing advancements in AI through its dedicated AI division. These initiatives are expected to further strengthen Microsoft's position in the tech industry, driving sustained growth and value creation for shareholders.
Despite recent market overreactions and a temporary slowdown in Azure's growth, Microsoft's core fundamentals and strategic investments in AI underscore its long-term potential. The company remains a solid investment opportunity, especially in a volatile market, with strong financial performance and a well-positioned AI roadmap likely to drive future growth and value creation for shareholders.

237,2024-08-29 15:31:06+00:00,Microsoft (MSFT) Down 1.9% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,  Zacks Equity Research ,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Microsoft (MSFT). Shares have lost about 1.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Microsoft due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.
Microsoft reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings of $2.95 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.72% and improved 9.7% on a year-over-year basis. At constant currency (cc), earnings increased 11% year over year.Revenues of $64.7 billion increased 15.2% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.84%. At cc, revenues grew 16% year over year.Commercial bookings were significantly ahead of expectations and increased 17% year over year and 19% at cc. This was driven by growth in the number of 10-million-dollar-plus and 100-million-dollar-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 and consistent execution across the core annuity sales motions.Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% year over year (up 21% at cc) to $269 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenues in the next 12 months, up 20% year over year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 21%. In the reported quarter, the annuity mix was 97%.Microsoft Cloud revenues were $36.8 billion, which jumped 21% (up 22% at cc) year over year and was roughly in line with expectations.
The Productivity & Business Processes segment, which includes the Office and Dynamics CRM businesses, contributed 31.4% to total revenues. Revenues increased 11% (up 12% at cc) on a year-over-year basis to $20.3 billion, slightly ahead of expectations driven by better-than-expected results across all business units. The reported figure beat the consensus mark by 1.06%.Office commercial products and cloud services revenues grew 12% (up 13% at cc). Office 365 commercial revenues increased 13% (up 14% at cc), with ARPU growth primarily from E5 momentum as well as Copilot for Microsoft 365.Teams Premium has surpassed three million seats, up nearly 400% year over year, as organizations like dentsu, Eli Lilly and Ford chose it for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation.Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 7% year over year, with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was driven by small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although both segments continued to moderate.Office commercial licensing declined 9% and 7% at cc, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings.Office consumer revenues increased 3% (up 4% at cc), with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 10% to 82.5 million.LinkedIn revenues rose 10% (up 9% at cc), driven by better-than-expected performance across all businesses, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions and Sales Solutions. LinkedIn sessions grew 13% with record engagement.  LinkedIn continues to see accelerated member growth and record engagement. Markedly, 1.5 million pieces of content are shared every minute on the platform and video is now the fastest-growing format on LinkedIn, with uploads increasing 34% year over year. Premium sign-ups soared 51% this fiscal year. Dynamics revenues jumped 16% year over year, driven by Dynamics 365 which grew 19% and 20% in cc. Microsoft witnessed continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business. Dynamics 365 now represents roughly 90% of total Dynamics revenues.The Intelligent Cloud segment, including server and enterprise products and services, contributed 44.1% to total revenues. The segment reported revenues of $28.5 billion, which increased 19% year over year (up 20% at cc) but missed the consensus mark by 0.53%.Server products and cloud services revenues jumped 21% (up 22% at cc), driven by Azure and other cloud services revenue growth of 29% (up 30% at cc), including roughly 8 points from AI services where demand remained higher than available capacity.In per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 10% to more than 281 million seats, with continued impact from moderated growth in seats sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. In the on-premises server business, revenues rose 2% (up 3% in cc), driven by demand for its hybrid solutions although with slightly lower-than-expected transactional purchasing.Enterprise and partner services revenues decreased 7% on a strong prior-year comparable for Enterprise Support Services.More Personal Computing segment, which primarily comprises Windows, Gaming, Devices and Search businesses, contributed 24.6% to total revenues. Revenues increased 14% year over year (up 15% at cc) to $15.9 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.13%. The growth included 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations driven by Windows commercial and Search.Windows OEM revenues increased 4% year over year, primarily driven by the slightly better PC market.Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenues grew 11% (up 12% at cc), which was ahead of expectations due to higher in-period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts.Devices revenues plunged 11% (down 9% at cc) as the company remained focused on higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising revenues ex-TAC climbed 19%, which was ahead of expectations, primarily due to improved execution. Healthy volume growth was driven by Bing and Edge. Gaming revenues soared 44%, with 48 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. The company now has more than 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. The company previewed a record 30 new titles at a showcase in the reported quarter. 18 of them, such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, will be available on Game Pass.

""Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft’s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure's growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.""

Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.""

240,2024-09-09 21:18:58+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Hedge Funds Are Bullish On This Big Company Stock Now,  Bob Karr ,"We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other big company stocks.
Mega-cap stocks—major technology companies to be precise—continued to drive a disproportionate share of the total US stock market returns. Market experts believe that from 2023 beginning to May 2024 end, only a handful of the biggest and most well-established technology companies drove ~60% of the S&P 500’s 40%+ gain.
FactSet reported that, for 2Q 2024 (with 93% of S&P 500 companies publishing actual results), ~79% of the S&P 500 companies reported positive EPS surprises. On the other hand, ~60% of S&P 500 companies reported positive revenue surprises. In 2Q 2024, semiconductor companies’ stocks were the critical drivers for the S&P 500 Index. The AI themes supported other sectors, like utilities, seeking support from higher electricity demand for AI data centers.
Wall Street experts believe that estimates for 3Q 2024 have seen a decline and the magnitude of estimate cuts seems to be significantly bigger than compared to the comparable periods of the first 2 quarters of 2024. Market participants opine that total S&P 500 earnings should see an increase of 3.9% from the same period of last year on 4.7% revenue growth. These estimates have come down since the beginning of the period, as the current 3.9% growth had fallen from 6.9% at the beginning of July.
The decline in estimates stems from the risks associated with economic downside, slower disinflation, expectations for higher-for-longer rates, and increased geopolitical risks.  Apart from these risks, the uncertainty around the US Presidential elections remains the most important factor responsible for the decline in estimates.
Wall Street analysts believe that uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election is expected to rise as the November vote draws closer. This can act as an additional headwind in the environment already demonstrating signs of losing momentum.
Reuters reported that populism, polarization, and an expected tight race can result in a surge in the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU). This is a news-headline-based index, which was created by economics professors Steven J. Davis, Scott R. Baker, and Nick Bloom. The rise in EPU takes place when an uncertain outlook about government policy prompts consumers to delay their spending and forces businesses to put a halt on investment and hiring.
Brandywine Global Investment Management (A Franklin Templeton Company), an investment management firm, believes that this might be happening in the current environment. The firm noted that the University of Michigan's current economic conditions index remains below the expectations index. Notably, this is a rare occurrence, suggesting that consumers are anxious.
Analysts at Brandywine Global believe that this year's election cycle, whether warranted or not, continues to impact the US consumer, which in turn, is impacting the corporate sector.
In the 2020 follow-up working paper, Davis (the co-founder of the EPU index) and his colleagues revealed that the EPU index tends to increase by ~18% in the month of November during a Presidential election. When elections come close, and there is a winning margin of less than 5%, and polarized, the EPU index can jump by ~28% in election month.
Political uncertainty can be a more powerful factor in asset prices, with investors focusing on the US Presidential elections. A JPMorgan survey revealed that investors continue to see political risk in the US and abroad as the top destabilizing metric for equities.
AI fever coupled with strong earnings has supported broader equities in 1H 2024, and gains have been concentrated in technology and growth stocks. Analysts opine that some investors are still looking for areas of the market that have underperformed, and they expect that the recent rally in tech might spread into other sectors as well. Most investors welcomed the signs of a slowdown in inflation and moderation in growth. As a result, the US Fed has hinted to cut key interest rates. With uncertainties looming, market experts believe that investors should stick to the big stocks, which have a healthy track record of delivering strong gains.

Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft’s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure’s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.”

241,2024-07-31 18:53:18+00:00,Microsoft and AMD’s results perfectly illustrate the two sides of the AI trade, Daniel Howley    · Technology Editor,"Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) and AMD (AMD) started off the trading day on Wednesday heading in opposite directions as Wall Street digested the companies’ Tuesday evening earnings. Microsoft fell some 7% in after-hours trading following its shaky report and continued trading down more than 1% Wednesday afternoon. AMD shares, on the other hand, jumped more than 3%, lifting fellow chip behemoth Nvidia (NVDA) as well.
The companies’ results and Wall Street’s reaction brought the two sides of the AI trade into stark relief as traders showed their disappointment in Microsoft’s AI software sales and exuberance over AMD’s chip sales.
The opposing views show how anxious investors are to see a sizable return on companies’ massive investments in the infrastructure needed to power their AI software offerings. On the flip side, chipmakers like AMD continue to reap the benefits of software makers’ AI infrastructure buildout, sending revenue and shares higher.
In an investor note following Microsoft’s announcement, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill noted that Microsoft’s Azure revenue slowed in the quarter from 31% in Q3 to 30% in Q4, and is expected to continue slowing in Q1.
And while Microsoft said it expects to see improvements in Azure growth in the second half of its current fiscal year, investors’ reactions to the company’s slight miss on Intelligent Cloud revenue, which includes its Azure platform and analysts’ repeated questions about when Microsoft will start raking in cash from AI sales, shows Wall Street won’t wait forever for the AI trade to pay off.
Microsoft’s fourth quarter earnings were largely positive despite its Intelligent Cloud numbers, and even those weren’t awful. The company reported Intelligent Cloud segment revenue of $28.5 billion, just shy of Wall Street’s expectations of $28.7 billion, but up 19% year over year. Overall revenue came in at $64.7 billion versus an expectation of $64.5 billion.
But Microsoft also continues to plow cash into building out its AI data centers. According to CFO Amy Hood, Microsoft’s capital expenditures, including finance leases, topped out at $19 billion, up from $14 billion in the third quarter.
“This new figure requires faith that Microsoft is picking up sufficient demand signals, and in our view the ‘return on capex’ concerns are likely to persist,” UBS Global Research analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following Microsoft’s earnings announcement.
Still, Microsoft pointed to a number of bright spots in its AI business, noting that AI contributed 8 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, up from 7 percentage points in Q3 and 1 percentage point in Q4 last year.
The Windows maker also noted that it’s still dealing with supply constraints keeping more customers from gaining access to its AI products, which is one of the reasons for its massive AI spend. That bottleneck, however, should start to clear up sometime in the second half of 2025, the company said.
“We believe the results and outlook for Azure AI are especially strong in light of the capacity constraints [Microsoft] faced in [the fiscal fourth quarter] and expects to continue to see in 1HF25 [first half of 2025]. More positively, management expects these issues to be alleviated by 2HF25, which should help drive a reacceleration in overall Azure revenue growth,” Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz wrote in a note to investors Wednesday.
While Microsoft shares struggled to gain traction Wednesday, AMD’s stock climbed more than 4% in mid-day trading Wednesday, driven by better-than-expected results from the company’s Data Center segment. AMD reported Data Center revenue of $2.8 billion, beating analysts’ expectations of $2.75 billion, and climbing 115% year over year from $1.3 billion in Q2 last year.
Microsoft’s capital expenditure expansion also plays into AMD’s growth, since the cloud provider, and hyper scalers like it, will inevitably need to purchase graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) from the chip giant and its rivals, including Nvidia.
To that point, AMD raised its sales forecast for its AI chips for 2024 from $4 billion to more than $4.5 billion. We’re still a few weeks away from Nvidia’s earnings report on Aug. 28, but shares of the AI darling rocketed more than 10% on Wednesday on the strength of AMD’s results.
Of course, the AI trade is by no means settled, and we’re still in the early days of not only the infrastructure build-out, but also in understanding how the software will impact businesses big and small, as well.
And until AI hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon begin to see massive profits from their huge investments, you can expect investors to continue asking one question over and over again: “When’s the money coming in?”

242,2024-08-01 18:45:49+00:00,Microsoft Azure Attack Shows Persistence of Blunt Hacking Tool,  Evan Gorelick ,"(Bloomberg) -- The recent outage on Microsoft Corp.’s cloud-computer platform demonstrated the persistence of an older, blunt-force style of cyberattack.

It’s called a distributed denial-of-service attack, DDoS for short, and it works by directing massive amounts of junk internet traffic at a target, like a website or server, to disrupt it or even knock it offline. It’s become a favorite tool of hacktivists seeking to make a statement by targeting government institutions, banks or major companies.
The attack on Microsoft started Tuesday morning, hours before the technology giant was scheduled to announce quarterly earnings. Customers of its Azure cloud platform faced outages for hours. Mobile ordering at Starbucks Corp. was down, as were certain online services from the UK government’s courts and tribunals service and the Dutch football club FC Twente. Microsoft 365, which includes popular applications like Outlook and Excel, was also impacted.
To make matters worse, an error in Microsoft’s automated defense mechanism “amplified” the attack instead of mitigating it, the company said in a status update.
DDoS attacks were once considered a “solved problem,” according to Boaz Gelbord, chief security officer at Akamai Technologies Inc. “Attackers could clog the pipes, and then providers could buy bigger pipes, and then they’d be safe from DDoS.”
But today, they are cheaper and easier than ever and can even be purchased on the dark web for as little as $11, according to Akamai.
“One of the phenomena we’ve seen in recent years is DDoS attacks resurging,” Gelbord said.“They’re a problem for small sites, but especially now for enterprise companies. It used to be the opposite.”
DDoS attacks, which have been around for decades, aim to flood web servers with so much traffic that they become virtually inaccessible to legitimate users. The proliferation of internet-connected devices has helped intensify the attacks. Specialized malware is used to infect everything from smart TVs and fitness trackers to baby monitors and video cameras. The malware weaves those infected devices into a single network known as a “botnet,” a zombie army that can be directed to overwhelm servers with millions of requests at once.
Aside from making political statements, DDoS attacks are sometimes part of broader extortion schemes in which hackers seek a payment to make them stop. It’s not yet clear who was behind the Microsoft attacks.
DDoS mitigation efforts often involve filtering out malicious traffic. However, requests from bots — those zombie computers — can look nearly identical to requests from real users, said Pavel Odintsov, chief technology officer of DDoS-mitigation company FastNetMon. Odintsov and five other DDoS experts told Bloomberg News that Microsoft likely exacerbated the impacts of Tuesday’s attack by blocking out real Azure users in its attempt to isolate illegitimate ones.
A Microsoft spokesperson said “a network device misconfiguration” contributed to the service interruption, but didn’t provide further details. The company is still investigating the Azure outage, which has now been fully resolved, the spokesperson said.
“When you have a hammer, everything is a nail,” Odintsov said. “It’s quite easy to make a mistake and block real customers.” Over the past four years, Odintsov said, the number of DDoS attacks his company has observed has approximately doubled each year.
DDoS attacks are getting tougher to defend against, Gelbord said, because botnets are getting bigger and more accessible. With an ever-increasing number of web-connected devices and gadgets, cybercriminals have more potential electronic devices to enlist as unwitting participants in their attacks. “You have much more readily available botnet armies,” Gelbord said. “It’s almost like an industry. You can rent them for hire, fairly inexpensively.”
On Wednesday, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA, jointly warned of potential DDoS attacks during the upcoming 2024 US presidential election. The attacks have been used in the past to target election infrastructure, and the government agencies said they will likely be used again for the same purpose.
In Venezuela, DDoS attacks have spiked tenfold since President Nicolás Maduro declared victory in a disputed election, according to NetScout Systems Inc. Political demonstrations have erupted on the streets of Caracas to protest what some are calling a fraudulent win.
“It’s not a specific hacktivist group, but a form of digital protest to real-world events,” said Richard Hummel, a senior threat intelligence manager at NetScout. “This is cyberactivity where adversaries are trying to effect chaos.”

243,2024-09-09 13:00:16+00:00,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is a Trending Stock,  Zacks Equity Research ,"Microsoft (MSFT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned -1.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 1.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $3.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.04 points to a change of +10.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.02 indicates a change of +15.2% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Microsoft.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
In the case of Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate of $64.45 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14%. The $277.39 billion and $314.94 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.2% and +13.5%, respectively.
Microsoft reported revenues of $64.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.2%. EPS of $2.95 for the same period compares with $2.69 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.84%. The EPS surprise was +1.72%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Microsoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

244,2024-08-28 10:44:56+00:00,Is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) the Best AI Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?,  Fahad Saleem ,"We recently published a list of Hedge Funds are Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. Since Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.
The AI-led rally in the stock market is expected to ripple through other sectors and smaller tech companies, but analysts believe for now large-cap companies are still the key focus of money managers. Morgan Stanley in its August key themes report said that while small-cap stocks rebounded on rate-cut hopes, the window for their outperformance is “too narrow.”
“Historically small cap outperformance depended primarily on economic growth acceleration. Greater risk exposure to a “higher-for-longer” rate environment has added inverse rate correlation to the mix. While periods of growth acceleration with lower rates are plausible (e.g. end-2023), we see this combination as relatively unlikely in the current inflation environment. The recent decline in interest rates was a tailwind to small cap stocks, but softer economic data likely limits the durability of this trade,” the firm said.
The latest earnings season showed that ROI on the huge AI spending by major companies is small in the short term, but long-term gains seem promising. Many companies have already started seeing monetization on their AI investments.  Goldman Sachs analysts Joseph Briggs, Kash Rangan, and Eric Sheridan said in a June report titled GEN AI: TOO MUCH SPEND, TOO LITTLE BENEFIT? that they remain more optimistic about AI’s economic potential even if we don’t see immediate benefits for now.
Hedge funds are one step ahead of average individual investors due to the sheer scale of resources and capital they have. That’s why it’s always interesting to see which stocks they are buying and selling. In this article we take a look at the 10 most important AI stocks which were on the radar of elite money managers based on their second-quarter filings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Total Number of Hedge Fund Investors as of the End of Q2: 279
Total Number of Hedge Fund Investors as of the End of Q1: 293
Billionaire investor Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management’s stake in Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) inched up by 0.6% to about $1.7 billion during the second quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners decreased its stake by 22% while Michael Platt and William Reeves’ BlueCrest Capital Mgmt. increased their hold on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) by over 1,000%. Billionaire Dalio’s Bridgewater increased its take in MSFT to 1.09 million shares from 580K.
Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently fell following its latest quarterly results which showed the company’s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.
But what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office’s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year’s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year’s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year’s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.
While Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and would bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year’s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.
Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“The top absolute contributors were Alphabet, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon. Microsoft was another top absolute contributor in the quarter, speaking to a growing appreciation for all the ways the company has an opportunity to monetize GenAI, be it in its Office suite or Azure cloud business. In the latter case, it contributed 7% to Azure’s revenue growth in the most recent quarter. We believe Microsoft remains a highly advantaged business with many secular tailwinds driving durable growth for the foreseeable future, even at its immense scale.”
Overall, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Hedge Funds are Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

245,2024-08-15 23:30:04+00:00,Is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) the Best Stock to Buy According to Cathie Wood?,  Fahad Saleem ,"We recently published a list of Cathie Wood’s 11 Favorite AI Stocks. Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 11th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.
Cathie Wood’s flagship fund is continuing to face steep losses amid a broader pullback in technology stocks. Wood’s flagship fund ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is down about 18% so far this year and has lost about 75% of its value since hitting its peak in 2021. However, the latest data shows that the innovation-focused investor bought the dip on tech stocks after the latest selloff that shook financial markets globally.
Investors have pulled about $2.2 billion from ARK funds in 2024. The fund is on track to post its worst year of investor exodus since 2014. But Cathie Wood is doubling down on her innovation bets and is hopeful the upcoming rate cuts will be positive for the stock market.
Cathie Wood Says “Something Is Changing” and the Fed is Now on “High Alert”
Talking about the market situation, Cathie Wood said in a latest video on her YouTube channel that the recent selloff shows the market is going through a “cathartic” phase and “something is changing.”
“I do believe that the Fed now is on high alert because the stock market seemed to be encouraging the Fed to hold tight, higher for longer, make sure that the inflation was out of the system.”
Cathie Wood said that corporations are now in a weaker position amid high rates and they will initiate layoffs to cut costs and increase productivity. This weak employment situation could encourage the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates, according to Wood.
“Interest rates coming down should be very positive for the equity markets, but they will not arrest a recession very quickly. In fact, if consumers and businesses know that interest rates and maybe prices will be coming down, what will they do? They will wait.”
Cathie Wood’s ARK has posted its latest stock holdings data as of the end of the June quarter. For this article we scanned the fund’s latest portfolio and picked 11 AI stocks it has positions in. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
Cathie Wood’s Latest Stake Value: $15,279,433
Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently fell following its latest quarterly results which showed the company’s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.

246,2024-07-29 10:40:24+00:00,Microsoft's costs in focus as fears rise over slow payoff from AI,  Aditya Soni ,"Microsoft (MSFT) investors will have one big question when the tech giant reports earnings on Tuesday: has growth in its Azure cloud-computing business picked up enough to justify the billions of dollars being spent on artificial intelligence infrastructure?
Widely seen as the front-runner in the race to make money from AI, thanks to its tie-up with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Microsoft is expected to report that Azure's growth stayed steady quarter-over-quarter at about 31% between April and June, according to data from Visible Alpha.
That would be in-line with the company's forecast, but investors are expecting a bigger contribution from its AI business in the fiscal fourth quarter after it accounted for 7 percentage points of Azure's growth in the first three months of the year.
Microsoft's capital spending likely surged about 53% year-over-year to $13.64 billion in the period, according to 16 analysts polled by LSEG. A big step up from the $10.95 billion in expenditure it recorded in the previous quarter.
Fears that runaway spending by tech giants on data centers would yield little payoff in the short term have dogged the US stock market this month amid signs that Wall Street may have become too optimistic about earnings growth.
Shares of Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG) fell more than 5% last week after the company reported a quarterly capital spending that exceeded estimates by nearly $1 billion, while the revenue boost from AI integrations remained modest, sparking a selloff in major tech companies.
Alphabet said its quarterly capital expenditure would stay high for the rest of 2024 at or above $12 billion.
""Investors will be very focused on Microsoft's ability to continue to accelerate revenue growth, especially the portion related to AI. If revenue acceleration doesn't materialize and increases in capex continue, investors may be disappointed,"" said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson.
Microsoft has said it needs to spend on data centers now to overcome the capacity constraints that are hampering its ability to capitalize on AI demand.
Its view echoes that of other tech companies, including Alphabet. The Google parent's CEO, Sundar Pichai, said last week that ""risk of under-investing (in AI infrastructure) is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing.""
 'Well positioned'
The spending surge has allowed Microsoft to court more business from its large enterprise client base by offering expanded access to its AI cloud service and rolling out features such as its 365 Copilot assistant for Word and Excel.
Microsoft has said the $30-per-month Copilot service, which can summarize heaps of emails into a few bullet points or speedily complete lines of computer code, is used by half of the Fortune 500 companies.
The Redmond, Washington-based tech giant is, however, yet to disclose the revenue contribution from the service, and analysts believe Copilot's impact will be more apparent in the back half of calendar year 2024.
""While a lot of focus has been on consumer-facing applications like ChatGPT, (generative AI) is potentially a larger opportunity for enterprise and Microsoft is just incredibly well positioned to capitalize on their install base,"" said Igor Tishin, analyst at Harding Loevner, a $55 billion asset manager that counts Microsoft and Alphabet among its largest holdings.
Microsoft shares have risen about 13% this year, adding more than $350 billion to the company's market value. The stock hit a record high on July 5, but has dipped nearly 9% in the recent tech selloff. It has underperformed a 14.5% rise in the S&P 500 this year.
The company is expected to post a 14.6% increase in overall revenue for the April-June period, compared with 17% growth in the previous quarter.
That is mostly down to slower growth in its personal computing business that includes Windows and the Xbox gaming division. The productivity business - home to the Office suite of apps, LinkedIn and 365 Copilot - is expected to post growth of about 10%.

247,2024-08-31 15:16:32+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT): Trending AI Stock,  Usman Kabir ,"We recently published a list of 17 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other trending AI stocks.
The AI industry continues to be highly dynamic, with significant growth anticipated across various sectors in 2024. The expansion of generative AI, which saw exponential growth in 2023, is expected to continue this year, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value as businesses move from pilot projects to broader implementation. This shift suggests that 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI as companies aim to leverage capabilities more fully to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate across different industries. The market for generative AI is forecasted to grow rapidly, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 60%, reaching a valuation of around $37 billion by 2028. This growth is fueled by the widespread adoption of AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.

The AI revolution is already transforming operations across the world by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and enhancing predictive capabilities. The healthcare sector, for example, is poised for substantial advancements due to AI, with the market expected to grow to around $188 billion by 2030, driven by innovations in genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. Edge computing is another area likely to see significant development in 2024, as it becomes increasingly critical for enabling AI applications that require real-time data processing. The move towards edge computing, where data is processed closer to the source, is expected to reduce latency and improve the performance of AI systems, particularly in sectors like autonomous vehicles, IoT, and industrial automation.
This trend underscores the growing importance of a robust semiconductor supply chain, especially as global trade tensions and geopolitical events continue to impact the availability of critical components like chips. Experts also emphasize the growing importance of ethical considerations and responsible AI. As AI technologies become more deeply embedded in various aspects of society, concerns around privacy, bias, and security are likely to intensify, prompting calls for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. The rapid growth will also bring challenges related to talent acquisition, supply chain management, and the need for responsible AI practices. As such, the industry is likely to be marked by both tremendous opportunities and complex challenges in the near term.

248,2024-08-09 11:15:00+00:00,"If You Bought 1 Share of Microsoft at Its IPO, Here's How Many Shares You Would Own Now","  Charlene Rhinehart, The Motley Fool ","Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the stocks you probably wish you had scooped up at its initial public offering (IPO). The tech giant debuted as a public company on the Nasdaq at $21 per share on March 13, 1986, and now the price is 19x higher, closing at $399.61 on Aug. 6.
Even if you didn't catch Microsoft at its two-figure price tag, its stock has had some enviable price appreciation over the last 10 years. The company's remarkable growth streak has pushed it into the elite $3 trillion dollar market capitalization club, and it most likely won't stop there.
What makes Microsoft's growth story even more compelling is its history of stock splits. Although stock splits don't fundamentally change the value of a company, they'll increase the number of shares you own. This share increase, combined with the rise in stock price over the years, would have made the current value of your initial Microsoft stock purchase significantly higher.
Stock splits were common in the 1990s, and Microsoft wasn't shy about jumping on the trend. It issued seven stock splits back then. But since then, they've tapered off, with Microsoft executing its last stock split in February 2003.

If you owned one share of Microsoft at the time of its IPO in March 1986, you'd now hold 288 shares after the nine stock splits. That means your shares would be worth over $115,000 as of Aug. 6, not including dividends.
With Microsoft's stock price hovering around $400 and its heavy influence on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, I wouldn't be surprised if the company finally stopped its stock-split drought soon.

249,2024-05-17 23:32:51+00:00,Microsoft offers cloud customers AMD alternative to Nvidia AI processors,  Max A. Cherney ,"By Max A. Cherney
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Microsoft said on Thursday it plans to offer its cloud computing customers a platform of AMD artificial intelligence chips that will compete with components made by Nvidia, with details to be given at its Build developer conference next week.
It will also launch a preview of new Cobalt 100 custom processors at the conference.
Microsoft's clusters of Advanced Micro Devices' flagship MI300X AI chips will be sold through its Azure cloud computing service. They will give its customers an alternative to Nvidia's H100 family of powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) which dominate the data center chip market for AI but can be hard to obtain due to high demand.
To build AI models or run applications, companies typically must string together - or cluster - multiple GPUs because the data and computation will not fit on a single processor.
AMD, which expects $4 billion in AI chip revenue this year, has said the chips are powerful enough to train and run large AI models.
As well as Nvidia's top-shelf AI chips, Microsoft's cloud computing unit sells access to its own in-house AI chips called Maia.
Separately, the Cobalt 100 processors Microsoft plans to preview next week offer 40% better performance over other processors based on Arm Holdings' technology, the company said. Snowflake and others have begun to use them.
The Cobalt chips, which were announced in November, are being tested to power Teams, Microsoft's messaging tool for businesses, and positioned to compete with the in-house Graviton CPUs made by Amazon.com.
Amazon said this week that social network Pinterest and fintech firm Robinhood Markets have started using its Graviton chips.

250,2024-08-28 21:45:14+00:00,Microsoft (MSFT) Registers a Bigger Fall Than the Market: Important Facts to Note,  Zacks Equity Research ,"Microsoft (MSFT) closed at $410.60 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.78% move from the prior day. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 0.6% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.39%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 1.12%.
Shares of the software maker have depreciated by 2.15% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.97% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.15%.
The upcoming earnings release of Microsoft will be of great interest to investors. On that day, Microsoft is projected to report earnings of $3.09 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 3.34%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $64.45 billion, showing a 14.04% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.
MSFT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $13.04 per share and revenue of $277.39 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +10.51% and +13.16%, respectively.
Furthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Microsoft. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.
Our research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.04% lower within the past month. As of now, Microsoft holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
Digging into valuation, Microsoft currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 31.74. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 31.27.
We can also see that MSFT currently has a PEG ratio of 2.09. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Software was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.38 at yesterday's closing price.
The Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 66, putting it in the top 27% of all 250+ industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

251,2024-08-14 14:42:12+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Leading the Charge in AI and Beyond,  Ramish Cheema ,"We recently compiled a list of 10 Stocks That Will Change the World. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks.
If we were to try and summarize one of the biggest ways how to make money on the stock market, it’d include buying stocks of firms that have changed the world. The biggest and most valuable companies of today didn’t start that way, and those who had a chance to invest in them decades back are considerably well off and some are even among the richest people in the world.
In fact, the two biggest technologies that have changed the world since the 1970s are personal computing and the Internet. Within these, the former is older and started through the launch of products such as Windows and the Mac. The two companies that make these products are up by 405,920% and 166,238% on the stock market since their shares were listed. So, if you, or anyone you know, had bought $1,000 of shares back then, your investment would be worth $4 million or $1.7 million today.
Along with personal computing, the Internet is the second world changing technology that has not only reformed the way in which businesses operate and regular people live their lives but also left a slew of billionaires in its wake. Starting from the dotcom era of the 1990s, the few companies that did survive the ‘pop’ are among the largest and most valuable in the world today. These have managed to use the power of the Internet to change the way people shop and access information. The former, founded by Jeff Bezos, whose latest net worth is estimated to sit at $190 billion, is up 185,389% since its stock started trading.
A $1,000 investment back then would be worth $1.9 million. Similarly, the world’s largest search engine company and the world’s biggest social media firm, are up by 5,939% and 1,254% since their stock started trading in the 2000s. It’s a testament to the power of world changing technologies to drive stock prices that these quad digit percentage returns appear to be ‘meager’ when compared to the six digit returns of the world changing stocks that have been trading since the 1970s and the 1990s.
But what about 2024? After all, while these disruptive stocks have made their mark on Wall Street history, it is highly unlikely that they will yield similar returns in the future. Well, one disruptive technology that has caught the world by storm is artificial intelligence. Spurred by the public launch of the chatbot ChatGPT, AI’s proponents swear that it will transform the world just like the Internet did. This transformation is being spearheaded by big tech, as the largest technology companies in the world fork out billions of dollars in AI spending.
Data shows that during the first half of 2024, the four biggest AI players spent a whopping $106 billion in spending as part of a game theory-esque roulette that Mark Zuckerberg described as risking “building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late.” As for the future, analysts expect that AI spending over the next five years could touch a whopping $1 trillion. This spending has also driven the shares of the world’s pre eminent AI GPU maker (and the youngest game changing stock) to rise by 261,775% since they started trading.
Looking at these gains makes it even more important that we try to wager a guess at what future industries can change the world. One way to somewhat simplify our research is to look at what investment newsletters are saying. The writers of these newsletters are often on the hunt for high growth sectors since correctly identifying them leads to a boost of credibility that drives subscriptions and eventually leads to revenue. On this front, we looked at some such industries as part of our coverage of 10 Stocks That Will Skyrocket.
Within these industries, two that stand out are quantum computing and nuclear energy. For those out of the loop, quantum computing is an expansion of current computing as it significantly increases the data that a computer can compute. However, quantum computing stocks are laggards in the stock market. We covered top hedge fund quantum computing stock picks during our coverage of 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In. Out of these 12 stocks, 10 either have quantum computing returns baked into their stock price or are too important in the industry to ignore. Analyzing their year to date performance reveals that out of these ten quantum computing stocks, four are in the green and this drops to three if we focus only on pureplay quantum computing stocks. These three stocks rank 5th, 7th, and 12th on our list, and they are up by 2.7% to 129.75%, year to date.
For nuclear energy, let’s look at the stocks that are part of the list of the 12 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Buy Today. In this list, roughly seven nuclear energy stocks have considerable exposure to power generation. Their one year share price appreciation ranges between 79.8% to 11.38%, and the top three performing stocks are ranked 3rd, 5th, and 12th. As a refresher, nuclear energy is popular these days because of its potential to provide clean energy to AI data centers.
Finally, another sector that might change the world is robotics. Some Wall Street analysts are gushing over the sector as they believe that humanoid robots in particular can unlock a $30 trillion opportunity. This is on the back of these robots being able to perform jobs that humans are unwilling or unsuited for, and even Elon Musk is bullish on them as he believes that his car company could benefit from this unstoppable demand and become worth $25 trillion as a result. For more details, you can check out $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley.
Our Methodology
To make our list of the stocks that can change the world, we started with our coverage of 10 Stocks That Will Change the Future, analyzed their performance, and fine tuned the list to align with today’s hottest industries. Then, we scanned media reports for sectors such as AI, self driving, gene editing, weight loss drugs, and robotics. From these reports, a stock was chosen if it was mentioned in three or more reports. This yielded a final list of five new stocks.
For these stocks, we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. It is also one of the key players in the artificial intelligence industry by having partnered up with OpenAI. Microsoft is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, and its capital expenditure sat at a whopping $55.7 billion for the June 2024 fiscal year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) benefits from its considerable enterprise computing market share through the Azure platform, which also provides it with a sizeable market to sell its AI products. At the same time, investor expectations for a return on its AI investments are high, and the firm’s earnings calls are often beset with weak share price movement as it continues to provide weak AI related returns. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is present on both our lists since the media believes that along with AI, it can also play a crucial role in the autonomous driving industry.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s latest earnings call was one such event, where the shares only started to recover when management explained:
“For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 18% and 20% in constant currency, or US$28.6 billion to US$28.9 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth to be 28% to 29% in constant currency. Growth will continue to be driven by our consumption business, inclusive of AI, which is growing faster than total Azure. We expect the consumption trends from Q4 to continue through the first half of the year. This includes both AI demand impacted by capacity constraints and non-AI growth trends similar to June. Growth in our per-user business will continue to moderate.
Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that will change the world. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

252,2024-08-24 18:34:59+00:00,Analyst Thinks Microsoft (MSFT) AI Monetization Should Be Enough to Soothe Wall Street Concerns,  Fahad Saleem ,"We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.
AI stocks have pulled back considerably over the past few weeks and analysts believe this is exactly the healthy correction long-term investors were looking for. According to Bloomberg, Rob Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, said that AI stocks have stabilized at levels they can sustain for the rest of the year. The analyst said technical indicators now show AI stocks have gone from overbought to oversold territory.
“Now that positions have been unwound, there’s an opportunity for traders to take positions,” Sluymer reportedly said.
Many others agree with Sluymer. Dan Ives of Wedbush reiterated his view that we are still in the early stages of the AI bull market in a latest program on CNBC.
“If you look at what we’ve seen from AI revolution to broader tech, it’s been strong from an earnings perspective. And the growth scare that we saw, it’s just a bump in the road to what I believe is the fourth industrial revolution playing out,” Ives said.
For this article, we picked up 10 AI stocks that are making waves on the back of latest earnings, analyst ratings or important industry news. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 279
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives recently said in a note that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) latest results should be enough to allay the market’s concerns about AI monetization.
“Over the last few weeks, we have also seen an acceleration of enterprises and CIOs from our customer/partner conversations heading down the strategic AI path, which all comes down to use cases and ROI for these budget dollars,” analyst Dan Ives wrote in an investor note.
Ives thinks the results from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and a few other companies “gave more credence to the AI monetization phase.”
Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently fell following its latest quarterly results which showed the company’s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.
But what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office’s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year’s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year’s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year’s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.
While Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and will bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year’s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.
Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“The top absolute contributors were Alphabet, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon. Microsoft was another top absolute contributor in the quarter, speaking to a growing appreciation for all the ways the company has an opportunity to monetize GenAI, be it in its Office suite or Azure cloud business. In the latter case, it contributed 7% to Azure’s revenue growth in the most recent quarter. We believe Microsoft remains a highly advantaged business with many secular tailwinds driving durable growth for the foreseeable future, even at its immense scale.”
Overall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

253,2024-08-29 15:27:17+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): A Beginner Stock You Should Check Out,  Affan Mir ,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Beginner Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other beginner stocks.
While investing in the stock market carries risk, the US stock market is generally considered a safe place to invest. It has a long history of growth and has consistently recovered from downturns, including major recessions and financial crises.
Over the last four to five years, the market has been hit by several unexpected downturns, due to a global pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, among other things, that crippled the global economy. However, the US broader market recovered swiftly and has been performing well since 2023. It is nearly 19% up year-to-date, as of August 23.
Nevertheless, it is still a complicated place for beginners and they should consider investing in shares of well-established companies with a history of stable performance and reliability. These stocks typically belong to large, financially sound companies that operate in diverse industries, such as technology, consumer goods, and healthcare.
Additionally, beginners can also look into index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track major market indices like the S&P 500. These options offer diversification, which reduces the risk associated with investing in individual stocks while still providing exposure to the broader market's potential gains. Investing in such well-established and diversified assets can help beginners build confidence and knowledge in the stock market. For such ETFs, you can check out our article on the best large-cap growth ETFs.
On August 16, Melissa Minkow, director of retail strategy at CI&T, discussed the latest trends in U.S. consumer spending in a CNBC interview. Despite concerns about a potential recession, Minkow believes we might have avoided one. She pointed out that although consumers may feel like they are in a recession, their spending habits show otherwise. They continue to spend, especially when presented with discounts. Retailers have adapted by offering more targeted promotions this year, which has helped maintain consumer spending despite previous challenges like the pandemic and supply chain issues.
Minkow also noted that the effectiveness of promotions can vary across sectors. For example, quick-service restaurants like McDonald's and Starbucks haven’t seen the same benefits from discounts as other retailers, partly because consumers may opt for more cost-effective alternatives like home-cooked meals. Additionally, brands that are already positioned as discount options might not see as much impact from promotions. However, retailers who offer significant discounts on desirable items can attract cost-conscious shoppers and increase sales volume, potentially offsetting the impact on profit margins.
For beginner investors in the stock market, the current retail sector dynamics offer both opportunities and challenges. The resilience of consumer spending, even in the face of economic uncertainty, suggests that certain sectors and companies could continue to perform well, especially those that effectively use promotions to drive sales. Retailers offering targeted discounts on popular items may attract more customers, boosting their sales volumes, which could lead to positive stock performance.
However, beginner investors should also be cautious. Not all companies benefit equally from promotions, as seen with the restaurant and food segment, where discounts haven’t significantly improved earnings. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific business models and market positioning of companies before investing.
The U.S. stocks have seen a significant surge over the last few quarters, which are mainly driven by strong economic data and optimism about a potential soft landing for the U.S. economy. However, experts remain cautious as we discussed in our best defensive stocks article.
In the article, we discussed the J.P. Morgan report that noted the market's heavy reliance on large, high-quality tech and AI companies, and it warned that maintaining this momentum could be challenging due to high valuations and potential market volatility. Here is an excerpt from the article:
“According to a July report by J.P Morgan, recent market trends have benefited large, high-quality companies, especially in tech and AI, which have resulted in high market concentration. However, maintaining this momentum in the second half of 2024 could be difficult due to high valuations and investor positioning. The report says that while U.S. market volatility is currently low, it could rise if conditions change.
Our Methodology
For this article, we used stock screeners to identify large to mega-cap stocks with a revenue compound annual growth rate of at least 5% over the last 10 years. The companies we chose are well-known, well-established, fundamentally strong, and some also pay regular dividends. We listed the companies in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter of 2024.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is making significant strides in AI, a key area expected to drive future growth for the company.

The recent fiscal fourth-quarter results highlight the impact of this focus as the Azure OpenAI service saw a 60% increase in customers year-over-year and reached 60,000. Additionally, the average spending per Azure AI customer is on the rise, which reflects the growing value businesses see in its AI solutions.
Beyond Azure, the company's AI efforts are also flourishing across its other platforms. GitHub Copilot is already generating more revenue than GitHub did before Microsoft's acquisition as per the company. Its Copilot AI assistant is now embedded in a range of products, from Microsoft 365 to Dynamics 365 and Power Platform. These integrations are driving transformation, particularly in Dynamics, where AI capabilities are improving business processes.
In terms of financial performance, Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) largest revenue segment, the Intelligent Cloud, saw a 20% increase in the fourth quarter. This segment includes Azure, where AI services contributed significantly to this growth, accounting for 8% of the 29% year-over-year revenue rise in cloud services. The company expects that its investments in AI will continue to boost Azure’s growth in the second half of fiscal 2025.
Overall, the company's focus on AI is not only enhancing its product offerings but also contributing to robust financial results. The company's revenue for the fourth quarter was $245 billion, a 16% increase while operating income grew 24% year-over-year to $109.4 billion. With these strong financials and the ongoing expansion in AI, the company is one of the best beginner stocks to buy now as it capitalizes on the transformative potential of AI.
Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.”

254,2024-07-19 09:30:00+00:00,Microsoft outage leaves China largely untouched as tech self-sufficiency campaign pays off,South China Morning Post ,"The Microsoft Windows outage that affected foreign businesses and luxury hotels in China on Friday left the country's key infrastructure, from airlines to banks, largely unaffected, according to industry sources and social media posts.
As of 6pm local time, there have been no reports in mainland China of infrastructure breakdowns, while many airports in the Asia-Pacific region, from Hong Kong to Australia, were hit with disruptions. The international airports in Beijing and Shanghai were operating normally, according to their websites.
At the same time, the Windows error that resulted in a bluescreen on computers became a hot topic on Chinese social media platforms such as Weibo, as many foreign business offices across the country were affected by the breakdown.

A Shanghai-based staffer from a foreign company told the Post that her office started to experience computer crashes early Friday afternoon, and that almost everyone was affected. This employee's laptop display was stuck on a blue screen with the message, ""Recovery. It looks like Windows didn't load correctly.""
The company's information technology support then instructed everyone to shut down their computers, wait for further instructions and use mobile apps for instant messaging. The employee's accounting work was subsequently delayed by the outage. ""This month's [financial] report will be late,"" according to the staffer.
An employee from another foreign firm also reported experiencing blue screens around 1pm. While some of the employees could later restart their computers, they still could not access the company's website, which displayed a ""502 Bad Gateway"" error. The company told staff that ""global IT support has activated the highest level of response to address the issue"", according to the employee.
On Xiaohongshu, an Instagram-like Chinese social media platform, multiple users complained about the difficulty in checking into international franchise hotels such as Sheraton, Marriott and Hyatt in Chinese cities.
As China's public services largely remained unaffected, Microsoft's China website and social media channels did not issue any emergency notices. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
China's relative immunity to the outage showed the country's reduced reliance on foreign service providers such as Microsoft and the antivirus company CrowdStrike. In recent years, China has been rolling out a campaign across its government departments and key infrastructure operators to replace foreign hardware and systems with domestic ones.

The outages were caused by a software update from cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike, which hit Windows-based systems worldwide. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz confirmed on Friday morning local time via the social media platform X that his company was working to resolve the problem.
The minimal impact of the Microsoft outage in China has proved that the country has made progress in achieving its goal of ""safe and controllable"" computing systems, according to one Chinese government employee.
On Weibo, Chinese netizens joked that Microsoft ""has given them a half-day off"". One commenter said that ""our company just switched to new computers with the HarmonyOS system, so we can't join in your celebration"".

255,2024-08-27 13:00:16+00:00,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,  Zacks Equity Research ,"Microsoft (MSFT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned -3.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has lost 1.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $3.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.04 points to a change of +10.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.02 indicates a change of +15.2% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.4%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
For Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $64.45 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14%. For the current and next fiscal years, $277.39 billion and $314.94 billion estimates indicate +13.2% and +13.5% changes, respectively.
Microsoft reported revenues of $64.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.2%. EPS of $2.95 for the same period compares with $2.69 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.84%. The EPS surprise was +1.72%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Microsoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.
